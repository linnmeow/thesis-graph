For example, in the UK screening for certain types of cancer, such as breast or cervical cancer is now mainstream.\nThere are a number of well-established principles in medical screening, including that there should be a \"latent\" or hidden stage where the disorder is present but not apparent to the individual.\nIt is easy to see how the early stages of some cancers fulfil these criteria but what about psychiatric disorders like depression?\nMental health problems at work are certainly important - mental ill health at work costs the UK economy \u00a370bn-\u00a3100bn per year and impacts negatively on the lives of patients, their families, their colleagues and employers.\nHowever, just as patients with psychiatric disorders are more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators of violence, psychiatric illness at work impacts most on individual sufferers.\nNevertheless \"something must be done\" is an understandable response to the events of 24 March 2015 and there have been calls for greater levels of screening for mental health problems in certain professional groups.\nPsychiatric disorders can't really be \"screened\" for. There is no recognised \"latent\" phase. Moreover, psychiatric diagnoses are based largely on symptoms, so the concept of \"symptom-free\" depression, for example, is difficult to sustain.\nThere are more practical problems too, impacting on wider public mental health.\nPsychiatric disorders are among the most stigmatised of all, even in the 21st Century, and any large-scale efforts to \"flush out\" employees with mental disorders are likely to result in a reduced rather than a greater willingness to seek help.\nThere are no scans or blood tests for mental disorders, so making a diagnosis can be difficult, subjective and at times prone to error.\nA screening programme will produce many \"false-positives\" - people labelled with a psychiatric disorder who do not in fact have one. This may have significant adverse impacts for them, and may cause greater harm than not identifying the small number of \"true-positives\".\nIt is not \"screening\" for mental ill health at work that is needed but earlier recognition and better access to treatment.\nAt present, many people with a mental disorder are never diagnosed as such, and very few of those with more common disorders such as depression and anxiety receive any treatment. This would be a scandal in any other area of medicine.\nThere is good evidence on what aspects of the workplace can lead to mental ill health.\nHigh demands, low control over your work, an imbalance between what you feel you put in and what you feel you get out, low levels of support - these have all been shown to lead to higher levels of mental illness at work.\nA range of approaches to creating mentally healthy workplaces has been suggested both in the UK and Australia.\nThese workplace issues are in addition to the well-recognised individual risk factors for psychiatric illness, such as a difficult early life, low educational attainment and chronic physical ill health.\nWe should also remind ourselves that the workless population, especially those recently made unemployed, are at greater risk of psychiatric illness than those in work - psychiatric disorders cluster with other social factors to keep people at the bottom of society.\nAlthough the clamour for greater screening for mental illness at work is understandable, in my opinion it is unlikely that screening per se would have prevented the terrible loss of life on board Flight 9525.\nThere are better and more cost-effective ways to reduce the impact of mental illness at work.\nGreater focus on using our current knowledge to make workplaces healthier, establishing clear confidential pathways for employees to be referred or self-refer if there are concerns about their mental health (such as the Practitioner Health Programme for doctors and dentists), and increasing the proportion of patients able to benefit from both antidepressant medication and talking therapies, all have the potential to improve mental health.\nAnd it shouldn't really take an issue like Germanwings Flight 9525 to remind us how important mental health is for us all.\nDr Max Henderson is a senior lecturer and consultant psychiatrist at King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience.", "summary": "The deaths of 150 people aboard Germanwings flight 9525 was tragic enough, but the possibility that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane brought a new level of disbelief.", "id": "32735801"}, {"document": "Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Thomas Winsor said forces had mainly \"done well\" with 20% cuts in four years and more savings were likely.\nSir Thomas said a \"smaller service\" would have to \"work smarter\".\nIn December, the chief of the Met Police warned public safety would be at risk unless radical measures were taken to deal with funding cuts.\nBut speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, newly knighted Sir Thomas said: \"Austerity is here to stay.\n\"The police have already made, and done it well in the main, cuts of 20% in the last four years and they are facing cuts of a further 5% next year.\n\"There will inevitably be a time where they can't take any more but let us remember that measured crime has fallen dramatically -

In wards with two or more councillors up for election, voters will be asked to vote for two or more candidates.  If two seats are up for election, the two candidates with the most votes are declared the winners.\nSTV allows voters to put numbers next to candidates in order of preference. Candidates then need to reach a set share of the votes, determined by the number of positions to be filled.  The system is already used in local elections in Northern Ireland and Scotland.\nThe white paper also explains how councils will have to work together to deliver services, after the ditching of earlier plans to merge the 22 councils to eight or nine.\nCouncils which want to merge with their neighbours have been invited to do so, but the controversial merger plans - which had angered some council leaders - were abandoned after the assembly election in May.\nInstead, they will be required to deliver services - including social services and aspects of education - under a system of \"mandatory regional working\".\nMinisters had intended to use the same boundaries as the seven local health boards, but councils will instead be asked to offer their own options.\nIn addition, councils will be grouped into three regions - south-east Wales, south-west and central Wales, and north Wales - to work together on developing the economy and on transport.\nDecisions will be taken by joint committees of councillors, with the authorities pooling their budgets.\nMr Drakeford said: \"This white paper is not about change for change's sake.\n\"Our councils are working against a backdrop of extraordinary austerity and some services are facing a great deal of pressure.\n\"Local government reform is essential if we're to make these services stronger and more resilient to cope with the demands of the future.\"\nDarren Hughes, acting director of the Electoral Reform Society Cymru, welcomed the white paper, saying it showed ministers were \"serious about empowering voters and revitalising democracy in Wales\".\nHe said a \"fairer\" voting system would be a \"big step forward\".\n\"Moving away from the Westminster winner-takes-all system across the board would mean everyone's vote counted in local elections, drawing to a close the era of wasted votes and 'holding your nose',\" Mr Hughes said.\nMr Drakeford said he wanted to see a \"new relationship\" between councils and the public -

Another remaining question is whether the impacts will be felt at different times.\nIn St Andrews House, Gary Gillespie is in agreement with recent forecasts of around 2.3% growth in the Scottish economy.\nThe Scottish ITEM Club is slightly lower, at 2.2%, up by 0.2% points since its end-2014 forecast. The difference is hardly worth quibbling over. But what's striking is that puts Scotland significantly behind the growth rate expected by EY's ITEM Club for the UK as a whole, at 2.8%.\nThe analysis goes further than that, suggesting Scotland is on schedule to lag the growth rate in the rest of the UK for a few years to come.\nScotland and the UK have in common uncertainty around the eurozone and European Union membership. The EU referendum could also put pressure on sterling, by putting the trade deficit into starker relief, suggests the EY publication. Growth won't be helped by a sharp tightening in government spending.\nThe Scottish economy and the wider UK benefit from very low interest rates. Inflation is now around zero and staying low over the next year, while real wages rise.\nSo what makes Scotland different? Offshore oil and gas is an obvious candidate. Even if some think it has a neutral effect, the impact on the rest of the UK isn't weighted with the same downsides, proportionately. The wider economy ought to feel a positive effect.\nImmigration is helping fuel growth in parts of England, but it's less of a boost to Scotland. And when measured per head, to take account of higher population growth south of the border, recent growth in Scotland can be made to look better.\nThe finance sector has been flat, stellar whisky exports figures have come down to earth, and despite the best efforts of the transport sector (for which, read Falkirk bus builders among a few others), manufacturing is not performing that well.\nConstruction, which motored at a cracking 13% growth rate last year, is expected to fall back, though it still has the benefit of big public projects, from the Forth Replacement Crossing to Aberdeen's ring road and the M8 upgrade through Lanarkshire.\nSurveys of business confidence have been getting a bit gloomier in recent months, and retail spend is lagging well behind the rest of the country. That could be canny, instead of fuelling private debt even further, but shoppers are failing to do their patriotic duty to the economy in the short term.\nThe employment picture looks healthy, given the scale of the recent downturn and the high jobless rates elsewhere in Europe.\nNew jobs are being created, but nothing like as fast as in England. The net growth has been almost entirely in female employment over last year. That's been welcomed. But it suggests something's going wrong for men, without it being clear precisely what that is.\nAs often noted, the quality of jobs remains a problem - zero hours, temporary, part-time, skills underused and many wanting to work more hours than they can get.\nAnd the ITEM Club returns to concerns that some sectors face skill shortages, which could push up pay for some without it being backed by higher productivity.\nAll that said, it forecasts 25,000 more jobs this year, and 15,000 to 20,000 per year in the medium term.\nThat's while the working age population shrinks by 10,000 per year (and the number drawing pensions increases).

Instead, it licenses its designs to companies like Intel and Samsung, who then incorporate Imagination technology into their computer chips.\nAnd then they produce them - in the hundreds of millions. In the business it is called third-party licensing.\nIt is estimated that 300 million chips that incorporate Imagination's technology are shipped each year, and the British firm makes about 19p ($0.30) on each chip.\nThe market is growing fast.\nHossein Yassaie, the chief executive of Imagination Technologies, told the BBC: \"We have stated our goal of a billion units by 2016.\n\"It is really not difficult to see the volume increase is going to continue (and) penetration in the new markets is going to continue.\"\nAs well as graphics for smartphones, Mr Yassaie is confident that his company's other areas of expertise will be in high demand.\nThat includes connecting devices to the internet and to broadcast systems like radio, and delivering high-definition television to mobile phones.\nBut, if it is such a profitable, high-growth market, then what has stopped giant chipmakers like Intel and Samsung moving in?\nWell, designing graphics chips requires hundreds of extremely skilled engineers with years of experience.\nAccording to analysts, even a giant computer chip firms like Intel would struggle to build a rival team.\nThe nature of the industry also favours an independent firm that designs the product and then sells it on to everyone else - even to rival firms in the computer chip business.\n\"The economics of this industry vastly favour the third-party licensing model,\" says Lee Simpson, a technology analyst at Jefferies International.\n\"The time to market is a constraint for chipmakers. These guys work on nine-month product cycle, so design lead time is becoming crucial.\"\nCompanies that need computer chips, like Apple and Samsung, want new or upgraded products every year, so there's little time to experiment with new designs.\nCustomers also appreciate the independence of Imagination.\nIn fact, so keen are they to stop its technology falling into rival hands that Apple and Intel are the firm's two biggest shareholders.\nSo how did a relatively tiny British firm take the lead in such a valuable industry?\nWhen Mr Yassaie joined the firm in 1992, he was convinced that computer graphics was the business to be in.\nSo the firm developed its technology, and in 1997 landed a high-profile deal to supply the Japanese computer games firm Sega.\nBut shortly after that came his second strategic masterstroke.\nMr Yassaie decided that people would want to do everything they could do on their personal computers, on their mobile phones.\nAt the time many considered that impossible, as phones have a feeble power supply and, back then, screens were unsophisticated.\n\"I was being told by chief executives of other firms that there was no point in targeting the mobile phone market because the screens did not have have enough pixels,\" said Mister Yassaie.\nFortunately, Imagination's technology was well suited to this task as it required much less power than graphics processors in personal computers.\nIt quickly found customers for its designs and as demand for smartphones took off, so did Imagination's business.\nImagination also branched out into the radio business. In 2001 it launched the world's first portable digital radio and has been expanding the Pure range ever since.\nIt has given the Imagination an outlet for its broadcast technology and some valuable experience in dealing with a consumer market - rather than selling to companies.\nSo what could upset Imagination?\nSome analysts are concerned that the company is being distracted from its most profitable market, designing computer chips.\nIan Robertson, a technology analyst at Seymour Pierce, said: \"They are taking money out of graphics and investing it into other areas like networking technologies, but it is far from clear if real returns will emerge from those investments.\"\n\"I don't see another big breakthrough win like the graphics technology happening again.\"\nMr Yassaie is confident that is not the case. He thinks his chips are only going to be more important.\nHe says that in mobile devices, the graphics processing unit (GPU) is doing more and more of the work.\nFor example, Apple's popular voice command system, Siri, is driven by the GPU.\nAs for the new areas of business, Mr Yassaie says one should just look at the results.\n\"Recently we announced a deal with Qualcomm for our Ensigma technology.

The outline of the geography and the strata were printed from copper plate engravings, but the detail was finished by hand with watercolours.\nThe lower edge of a formation is saturated and then the paint is made to fade back to the high edge.\nIt is this colouring technique, combined with the tendency of many of England's rocks to dip to the south or southeast, that gives Smith's map its iconic look.\nThe re-discovered copy comes in 15 separate sheets. These have no serial numbers on them, but that in itself is a clue to the map's position in the production sequence.\nThe first batch in the run is known not to have carried any numbering. Another clue is the geology of the Isle of Wight. Smith changed its depiction several times, and the re-discovered map displays his earliest efforts.\nThe artefact is certainly among the first 50 to come off the production line, and very probably among the first 10.\nQuite what its value is - that is difficult to say. Possibly in the six figures.\nThe Geological Society has had the map fully restored and digitised. And from Monday, anyone will be able to view it online. The paper version will also go on display at the society's Burlington House HQ in London's Piccadilly.\nWilliam Smith (1769-1839) is often referred to as the \"Father of English Geology\" - a title bestowed on him by The Geological Society, which at first had been reluctant to embrace his vision.\nThe organisation's first members were drawn from the metropolitan elite, and they took a rather disdainful view of the blacksmith's son turned surveyor.\nBut the big landowners knew his worth. They brought Smith in to help them maximise the worth of their estates - to drain land, to improve the soil, to find building stone, and, above all, to find coal.\nIt is this work that would have brought him into contact with the rocks and with the fossils that would lead him to his greatest scientific contribution.\nJohn Henry explained: \"The concept which enabled him to do the mapping and that drove him along almost obsessively was this realisation that specific fossils were unique to a specific stratum, and that you knew where you were in a sequence if you could see what the fossils were. That was the breakthrough. People had been collecting them for a long time and naming them in the Linnaean way, but without any real idea that they were in a sequence. But Smith knew it.\"\nToday, it is called the \"principle of faunal succession\", and this idea holds that because fossils succeed one another in order, rocks containing similar fossils are similar in age.\nThis principle has enabled scientists to construct the geological timescale by which the relative ages of rocks can be measured, and thereby understand the history of the Earth.\nNo wonder Simon Winchester called his 2001 book about William Smith, The Map that Changed the World.\nMonday, 23 March, is Smith's birth date.\nSir David Attenborough is going to unveil a plaque at Smith's former residence at 15 Buckingham Street on London's Embankment.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "A first edition copy of one of the most significant maps in the history of science has been rediscovered in time for an important anniversary.", "id": "32004102"}, {"document": "The publications coincided with the opening of a new exhibition profiling the artist at Paris's Pompidou Centre this week.\nThe timing has highlighted a long-running tension colouring the legacy of some of France's 20th Century heroes.\nIt is the kind of declaration guaranteed to grab headlines here.\nOne of France's best-known creative minds; the man credited as a pioneer of modern architecture was, says author Xavier de Jarcy, an \"outright fascist\".\nNew evidence from the artist's personal records, says Mr de Jarcy, led him to conclude in his new book (Le Corbusier: A French Fascism) that the architect's sympathies for fascism were much stronger than previously thought.\n\"Personally I was very shocked,\" he told me.\n\"I found it hard to accept. You need time to absorb that kind of information.\"\nLe Corbusier, born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret in 1887, moved to France from Switzerland at the age of 20 and later became a French citizen.\nSome links to France's war-time government are well-known, but Mr de Jarcy says the new research shows much deeper ties.\n\"I discovered he was a member of a militant fascist group,\" he says.\n\"And he published around 20 articles which were clearly fascist in nature, where he declared himself in favour of a corporatist state on the model of Mussolini.\n\"There are also several witness statements from other group members, from his doctor who was a close friend, and from other militants.\"\nLe Corbusier's artistic legacy is currently being celebrated in a big new exhibition at France's Pompidou Centre, which has come under fire for not fully reflecting the debate around his political views.\nFrederic Migayrou, one of the curators of the exhibition, says the show was three years in the making, and the lack of discussion about Le Corbusier's politics has nothing to do with censorship, or avoidance of the issue.\nThe new books, he says, are acting \"like tabloids - surfing on the 50th anniversary of the artist's death\".\n\"They're just trying to create a media event,\" he told me.\n\"All the quotations on racism or fascism came from extracts of his private correspondence - he never published anything, nor made any public declaration against Jews.\n\"It's absurd. Le Corbusier was also in contact with many architects close to communism [and] people thought he was a communist in exactly the same way.\"\nSo what is the truth about Le Corbusier?\nDr Caroline Levitt from Britain's Courtauld Institute says the commonly accepted fudge is that Le Corbusier had \"ambiguous politics\".  And in some ways, she says, they were just that.\n\"His politics tended to shift,\" she told me.\n\"He was more of an ideologist than a politician. He was interested in the potential of architecture - what it could do.\"\nAnd it wasn't unusual for artists from that period to be labelled both communist and fascist, she says, and what made Le Corbusier so easily appropriated by both sides is his insistence on purification and classicism.\n\"He was trying to wipe out the troubled art of a troubled era, and suggest a life of order and clarity,\" she said.\n\"That's very appropriable by the Right. But it was also about shaking up the established ideas of the bourgeoisie, which is more akin to ideas of the Left.\"\nWhat isn't often talked about - or is consigned to a couple of lines - says Dr Levitt, is the work done by Le Corbusier for France's Vichy government in the early 1940s, drawing up city plans for Algiers.\nFrance's art establishment is often criticised for its close-door elitism, but it was the Pompidou Centre that covered Le Corbusier's association with the Vichy regime in an exhibition 25 years ago.\n\"Since then,\" says author Xavier de Jarcy, \"Le Corbusier has become a marketing product, and he needs a presentable image. There are lots of shadowy areas when it comes to the actions of certain French artists from that period, but people don't really talk about it.\"\nThe BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz says these kinds of political tensions in the French art world can be traced back at least as far as the mid-19th Century, to the scandal surrounding the Dreyfus affair, when a Jewish soldier in the French army was made a scapegoat for a crime he didn't commit.\n\"There's a famous incident around the Dreyfus Affair, which split the avant-garde art world down the middle,\" he says, \"with Degas and Cezanne taking an anti-Semitic line, and Pissaro and Monet siding with Dreyfus.\n\"It was an issue which rumbled through World War One and Two.\"\nAnd when it comes to the issue of Le Corbusier, he says, there is a much wider relationship between the worlds of art and politics.\n\"Modernism as a concept has an awkward relationship with fascism.

Kirkup, who investigated 11 baby deaths at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, said \"proper\" death certification could have saved lives.\nAn inquiry into killer GP Harold Shipman said Independent examiners should scrutinise death certificates.\nThe Department of Health said it was committed to death certificate reform.\nDr Kirkup told BBC Inside Out North West that greater scrutiny of death certificates by medical examiners - one of the key recommendations the third report of Dame Janet Smith's Shipman inquiry in 2003 - would have flagged up problems sooner at Furness General Hospital.\nHe carried out an inquiry into failures at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which is responsible for hospitals in Cumbria and Lancashire.\nHis report found a \"lethal mix\" of factors contributed to the unnecessary deaths of the babies and a mother, between 2004 and 2013.\nThe former Department of Health official found a \"dysfunctional\" maternity unit at the hospital, with \"substandard care\" provided by staff \"deficient in skills and knowledge\".\nWorking relationships between doctors and midwives had been extremely poor, with midwives pursuing a normal childbirth \"at any cost\" policy, Dr Kirkup found.\nHe said it should have been \"obvious\" there was a problem after about half of the babies had died.\nHowever, the cluster of deaths was \"ignored\" because there was nobody looking out for any patterns that would cause concern, he added.\nDame Janet's inquiry said reforming death certification could help prevent a killer like Greater Manchester GP Shipman, who murdered 215 patients and then signed their death certificates.\nIt could also identify potential deaths due to medical negligence, she said.\nShe recommended having an independent medical examiner to ask relatives if they had any concerns about the way their loved ones had died.\nThe medical examiners would also be trained to spot patterns of deaths and anomalies which caused concern, she said.\nA number of pilot schemes for medical examiners are taking place but they are yet to be rolled out nationally.\nDr Kirkup blamed financial complexities for the failure to implement the reforms, adding: \"I think in the end it does come down to money.\"\nHe said he believed better certification would also have uncovered problems at Stafford Hospital where official reports found between 400 and 1,200 more \"avoidable\" deaths than would have been expected in the period from 2005 to 2008.\nLesley Bennett's daughter Eleanor was the first baby whose death in February 2004 at Furness General should have raised concerns, Dr Kirkup said.\nMrs Bennett believes a medical examiner might have \"flagged up\" problems at the unit relating to the deaths that followed her Eleanor's.\nShe wants to see the medical examiner scheme extended across England and Wales, adding: \"It's a no brainer.\"\nAlan Fletcher, lead medical examiner in Sheffield, where a pilot scheme has been operating since 2008, said he always asks bereaved relatives the \"Shipman question\" about whether they have concerns over the death.\nHe said the government was \"missing an opportunity... to put in place a system that provides the necessary safeguard that everybody needs as a member of the public when somebody passes away.\"\nEarlier this year, the president of the Royal College of Pathologists, Suzy Lishman, described it as \"incomprehensible\" that the system had not yet been reformed to include medical examiners.\nDame Janet was not available for interview with BBC Inside Out North West but told the programme in 2010 she was frustrated at the lack of progress.\n\"We haven't moved at all on basic death certification\", she said at the time.\nThe Department of

A Tamil fisherman wades into the Nanthidakal lagoon and casts his net. There is a jetty and fishing boats here, a low causeway across which trucks trundle into the town of Mullaitivu.\nThere is little evidence of what happened here in 2009. Huge numbers of Tamils fled from the besieged zone across this lagoon. On its shore the body of the dead Tiger leader, Prabhakaran, was filmed, his scalp covered to conceal the fact that much of it was missing.\nThere is something which jars. There are many new signs in the neighbourhood, giving for instance the name of the lagoon or the government's account of what happened here during the conflict.\nIndeed, a war \"tourist trail\" is already springing up for Sri Lankan tourists. But nearly all the signs are in Sinhala and English only - not in Tamil, the local language and, of course, the language of the people who lost so much.\nThis is repeated all over the area: at a museum of captured Tiger equipment; at Prabhakaran's bunker, now a tourist spot.\nAt the bunker there are in fact many Tamil visitors including schoolchildren from nearby, and expatriates from Germany. A Sinhalese soldier, fluent in Tamil, acts as their guide. That is impressive. But there is barely a word of Tamil on the signs.\nAt two places we ask the military why this is. \"There was not anyone who could speak the language, but we would like to put up Tamil signs soon,\" one soldier says.  Another, though, tells me he has mentioned it to the higher authorities - \"but nobody is interested\".\nWhat does this say for reconciliation efforts in this country, whose war sprang partly from the fact that Tamils had said they felt like second-class citizens?\nThere are more immediate concerns. Along with the struggle to rebuild, there is little employment available.\nBy chance we met a former Tiger militant. He said there were no opportunities and no jobs. But he did not want war again.\nThe army presence is still massive.

And many places like the army-run cafes and shops which had sprung up, have now been closed.\nBut the government says it still fears a resurgence of the Tamil Tigers and it is not loosening its grip.\nIn one place an officer told us the army's intelligence network had actually expanded. \"We've been asked to keep a register of what people do and where they go,\" he said. \"We even monitor schoolchildren's activities.

But it is unlikely to provide a permanent solution.\nThe problem comes down to how countries choose to interpret \"extremism and terrorism\". Qatar has long prided itself on giving voice to alternative views to the edited, government-approved ones aired by its conservative neighbours. Hence one of the reasons why Qatar's Al Jazeera network has been such a thorn in their sides.\nHowever, the charge levelled against Qatar is that those alternative voices include people committed to the overthrow of governments in the region.\nQatar supports the Muslim Brotherhood, which it considers a peaceful, political force. But Qatar's opponents in the region consider the Brotherhood to be a terrorist organisation that is an existential threat to their rule. These differences have yet to be resolved.\nThey were combating terrorism and extremism, denying financing and safe havens to terrorist groups, stopping incitement to hatred and violence, and refraining from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, according to the New York Times.\nMr Mouallimi stressed that there would be \"no compromise\" on the principles, but added that both sides would be able to discuss how to implement them.\nThe list of 13 demands handed to Qatar on 22 June included shutting down the Al Jazeera news network, closing a Turkish military base, cutting ties with the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading relations with Iran.\nMr Mouallimi said closing Al Jazeera might not be necessary but stopping incitement to violence and hate speech was essential.\n\"If the only way to achieve that is by closing down Al Jazeera, fine,\" he was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. \"If we can achieve that without closing down Al Jazeera, that's also fine. The important thing is the objective and the principle involved.\"\nUAE permanent representative Lana Nusseibeh warned that if Qatar was \"unwilling to accept core principles around what defines terrorism or extremism in our region, it will be very difficult\" for it to remain in the Gulf Co-operation Council.\nQatar has acknowledged providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it has denied aiding jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS).\nUAE Minister of State for International Co-operation Reem al-Hashimi said: \"At this stage, the ball is in Qatar's court.\"\nShe added that the US had \"a very constructive and very important role to play in hopefully creating a peaceful resolution to this current crisis\".\nUS President Donald Trump was quick to claim credit for the pressure being placed on Qatar, saying it might mark the \"beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism\".\nBut his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, questioned the list of demands, acknowledging that some elements would \"be very difficult for Qatar to meet\".\nAlso on Tuesday, NBC News cited US intelligence officials as disputing a report that alleged Qatar had paid a ransom of $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3770m) to Iraqi Shia Muslim militias, Iranian security officials and Sunni Muslim jihadists in Syria as part of a deal to secure the release of royal family members kidnapped in Iraq.\nThe officials said Qatar had handed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300m ($345m) in cash to Iraq's government but that Baghdad had confiscated the money after securing the hostages' release.", "summary": "The four Arab nations leading a boycott of Qatar are no longer insisting it comply with a list of 13 specific demands they tabled last month.", "id": "40654023"}, {"document": "The Hollywood athlete impressed in winning the 110m hurdles at Sunday's Irish Championships in Santry in a season's best time of 13.89.\nPortaferry's Ciara Mageann will compete in the 1500 and 800m while sprinter Amy Foster goes in the 100m.\nChristine McMahon (400m) and Kerry O'Flaherty (3000m steeplechase) are also in the Irish team.\nMageean was another NI winner in Santry, securing 1500m victory in 4:24.33 and almost two seconds ahead of Rio steeplechase qualifier Sara Treacy.\nFoster and fellow Northern Ireland athlete Paralympic star Jason Smyth were 100m winners.", "summary": "Hurdler Ben Reynolds has been selected in the Ireland team for the European Champions in Amsterdam next month.", "id": "36640195"}, {"document": "One child aged six was missing for four days, while a teenager disappeared for 529 days, freedom of information requests have shown.\nThe NSPCC said the figures were \"hugely concerning\" as missing children are at risk of sexual exploitation.\nCouncils said they worked with agencies to protect and find them.\nThe data shows many of the children - who were mostly teenagers - went missing on multiple occasions.\nSource: Freedom of information requests\nTom Rahilly, from the NSPCC, said: \"Children go missing for many reasons - they're being bullied, they've been put in a home miles from their family and they miss them and their friends, or they just don't trust staff enough to tell them where they are.\n\"Many will have been abused before being placed in care and they need a lot of attention and protection.\"\nIn Torbay a 15-year-old disappeared on 11 separate occasions last year.\nTorbay Council said it could not comment on individual cases but care plans were reviewed to ensure children and placements were matched correctly.\nPlymouth City Council said: \"In the case of a 16-year-old who was missing for 529 days, this refers to a young person from another country who did not want to remain in our care.\n\"We worked with police and other agencies to ensure that we followed all the necessary safeguarding procedures.\"\nThe council added it had a \"thorough training programme\" for foster carers and specialist support for those children affected.\nDevon County Council said: \"The number of children that have gone missing while in our care is very small, less than 3%, but any is too many.\"\nIt added that all children's social workers were undergoing new training to help them better support vulnerable young people.", "summary": "Children went missing from council care in south-west England more than 350 times in the past five years, official figures have revealed.", "id": "31154294"}, {"document": "Paul Eastment and Chris Missen, from Porthcawl in Bridgend county, along with Poole-based crewman Martin Blaker-Rowe, rescued Vanessa Glover when water swept her from her car.\nThe crew will be presented with the Pride of Britain Emergency Services Award in London on Monday.\nThey were nominated by Mrs Glover.\nShe told the ITV programme Daybreak: \"They know how proud of them I am and how very grateful I am to be alive.\n\"I'm so grateful for this showcasing and nomination.

Her father was an alcoholic, who eventually died of pneumonia, and Mary effectively became the family's main breadwinner, working 12 hours a day in a jute mill.\nHowever she was inspired by her mother's strong Presbyterian faith and longed to follow in the footsteps of famed missionary and explorer David Livingstone and spread the word of God abroad.\nIn 1876, at the age of 28, Slessor set sail for Nigeria aboard the SS Ethiopia.\nShe held a number of positions at missionary compounds in the city but only managed to get herself deployed deeper into the city following an enforced leave of absence back in Scotland after she had contracted malaria in 1879.\nAt her new posting, instead of staying in the missionary compound, Slessor spent far more time among the people of Calabar, first learning to eat their food - she could hardly afford to feed herself, she sent so much of her wages home - and then learning the local language.\nWith her red hair and blue eyes, she was instantly recognisable to the local people, who came to trust and even revere her for the tireless fight she put up on their behalf.\nRt Rev John Chalmers, moderator of general assembly of Church of Scotland, is to visit Calabar this year to see at first-hand the difference Mary Slessor wrought.\n\"She was a remarkable woman in her time,\" he said.\n\"There was a very strict regime, a strict dress code and a manner in which the work of missionaries had to be carried out.\n\"What was different about Mary Slessor was that she realised that in order to be effective she had to break some of those moulds.\n\"She saw that there were great injustices, issues she felt were detrimental to the way women and children were treated in society.\n\"She saw it wasn't some dominant force that would change things but getting down beside people and learning their language, not being in a distant missionary house but living with them,\"\nOne injustice in particular which pained Slessor was the local superstition around twins.\nIt was held that when twins were born, one of them was possessed by an evil spirit.\nBecause no-one could tell which of the twins was the evil one, both were often abandoned or killed, and their mother ostracised.\n\"Mary Slessor realised it would take a generation of cultural change to bring about a difference,\" says Mr Chalmers.\n\"She worked right down at a grassroots level, adopted these children, saved their lives, and showed by example what needed to change.\"\nSlessor saved hundreds of twins who had been left in the bush to die, including Janie, a girl she took in as her daughter, going as far as to bring her home to Scotland with her.\nOn a further mission to Nigeria in 1888, Slessor embedded herself among the Okoyong and Efik peoples for 15 years, in an area previously thought too dangerous to work in after previous male missionaries were killed.\nLiving in a traditional house alongside the native people, Slessor became vice-consul of Okoyong, presiding over the native court, and became known at home as the \"white queen of Okoyong\".\nCarly Cooper, a curator at the McManus, Dundee's art gallery and museum, looks after a collection of Slessor's possessions and papers, which lay bare the change the missionary underwent in Calabar.\n\"When people think of missionaries they don't tend to think very positively about them but she was very different,\" she said.\n\"It wasn't completely about religion for her - it was at the start, when you look at her letters she sent back, she was very much the Victorian missionary, she would talk about 'the heathens'.\n\"But as time went on she learned their language, their cultural traditions and there was definitely a change - it wasn't all about converts, she actually had very few people who converted to Christianity, it was about improving people's lives.\"\nWhen she died, in 1915, Slessor was honoured with an elaborate funeral, with senior British officials attending in full uniform and flags flying at half mast at government buildings.\nRevered to this day by the Efik peoples in Calabar, Mary Slessor's legacy became one of mercy, rather than religious conversion.\n\"She didn't just take with her these Western values - she wore the same clothes as the locals wore, lived beside the people, learned their language and spoke to them in their tongue,\" said Mr Chalmers.\n\"That's what made her different  - in many respects perhaps the first of a new missionary kind, not just importing stuff from this country but being sensitive to the culture and the needs of the people there.\"\n\"Her legacy is that you can't just take your beliefs and standards and values abroad and dump them on people.\n\"If you're really interested in people's lives and making them better, you have to understand where they come from. You have to understand them as people and love them as people, and that's what Mary Slessor did.\"", "summary": "Scots missionary worker Mary Slessor, who died 100 years ago on 13 January, worked tirelessly to improve the lives of ordinary citizens of Calabar, Nigeria.", "id": "30577100"}, {"document": "Bans on the women's full-body swimsuits have also been lifted in Villeneuve-Loubet, Cannes, Frejus and Roquebrune.\nFrench Riviera mayors imposed the bans, but they were overruled on Friday by France's top administrative court.\nCritics see burkinis as a symbol of Islam and potentially provocative after the July terror atrocity in Nice.\nBut on Friday, France's Council of State ruled that the ban in Villeneuve-Loubet \"seriously and clearly illegally breached fundamental freedoms\".\nThe human rights lawyer who brought that case said he would take each town to court over their burkini bans.\nThe Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) and the Human Rights League (LDH) challenged the Villeneuve-Loubet ban, turning it into a test case.\nIn recent days courts in several French Riviera resorts have annulled their bans - even though local mayors had vowed to keep them in place.\nTwo beach resorts in Corsica - Sisco and Ghisonaccia - still have bans in place.\nFrench Prime Minister Manuel Valls wrote in support of the bans, saying burkinis were \"the affirmation of political Islam in the public space\".\nBurkinis were not mentioned by name in the bans, with the order simply saying beachwear must be respectful of good public manners and the principle of secularism.\nAuthorities had said that they were concerned about the public order implications of the religious clothing, especially after the attacks in Nice and Paris carried out by people influenced by Islamist extremism.\nOn Bastille Day, 14 July, a lorry careered into a beachfront crowd in Nice, killing 86 people.

Stirling, Joyce and Porterfield are a talented top three but as England have shown over two games, there is little below them.\nStirling and Joyce (16) added 68 for the opening wicket but both fell in the space of two and a half overs, the former to Jake Ball and the latter to Root, who would also claim the wickets of Niall O'Brien and Gary Wilson to help reduce Ireland to 154-5.\nPorterfield's clean striking carried the tourists past 200 until he was bowled by Mark Wood attempting a ramp shot, leaving the Durham seamer and Plunkett to clean up the tail.\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss, speaking to Sky Sports: \"We know we have sterner tests coming up, against South Africa and in the Champions Trophy.

Exports fell by 7.2% with a drop of more than 13% in terms of selling goods overseas. And that's the impact of a strong US dollar as well as disruptions at America's biggest ports.\nThe dollar has risen on the back of expected rate rises by the Fed, and has hit the highest level in more than 10 years against its trading partners.\nThat has hit the ability of US exporters to sell their wares overseas. Tellingly, services exports continued to grow by 7.3% since selling services isn't very dependent on the price but rather rely on the quality of what's proffered. It's also not dependent on ports.\nA strong dollar, though, helps consumption and imports, which registered positive growth of 1.8%.\nIn other words, a strong dollar makes imports cheaper and keeps down price rises. Those imports feed into consumption, which expanded by 1.9%.\nThat's not the strongest growth rate, since there are also reports that cold weather made consumers reluctant to venture out and spend.\nBut it's a positive growth driver alongside investment, which also expanded by 2%. The final component of GDP, government spending, contracted by 0.8% due to continued cutbacks by state and local governments.\nSo, what growth the US economy eked out was due to private consumption and investment.\nAnd that's been the traditional driver of the US economy - consumers. And, economists are already predicting that American consumers have completed their deleveraging process, so the engine of growth may well return later this year.\nAnd thus the prediction that the Federal Reserve will begin to normalise, ie, raise interest rates, later in the year.\nFor now, the impact of anticipating rate rises has strengthened the US dollar since markets anticipate and \"price in\" what's expected to happen.\nAnd that has dented growth now.\nFor the Fed, which concludes its two day policy meeting today, any signal that these figures are causing a re-think of when rates may rise will surely be closely watched.\nAnd, markets are likely to again price in what that means.\nIn any case, the US strong dollar policy which has favoured consumption over exports is likely to remain unchanged. After all, the United States is largely driven by consumption and a strong currency makes buying imports affordable.\nBesides, its services exports again are unlikely to depend on the value of the dollar so that surplus is intact even in today's release.\nFor those reliant on the US coming back as an engine of growth, the hope will be that this quarter is indeed just a blip due to the currency.", "summary": "The latest GDP figures for the US shows the economy has virtually ground to a halt as first quarter growth was just 0.2%.", "id": "32512640"}, {"document": "Officers attended a property in Plymouth after reports of a man with a can of flammable liquid were made by a member of the public.\nThe man later sustained serious burns and police records indicated a Taser was deployed, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said.\nIt was referred voluntarily by Devon and Cornwall Police to the IPCC.\nThe watchdog said the 32-year-old man was taken to the city's Derriford Hospital and has since been transferred to the burns unit at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.\nHis condition is described as life-changing, but is not considered to be life-threatening.\nThe IPCC said it believed two police officers attended the address in Honicknowle shortly after 21:00 BST on Thursday.\nIt added that the investigation would be looking at what extent, if any, police actions caused or contributed to the man's injuries, and whether officers acted in accordance with procedures.", "summary": "Contact police had with a man before he sustained serious burns is being investigated by the police watchdog.", "id": "22226680"}, {"document": "The flat-bottomed D-class dinghy will be moored on the River Mourne.

Then, hosts New Zealand had their pool matches spread over 24 days while England's were in 22 days.\nPretty much all Six Nations and Rugby Championship teams had a more leisurely schedule than those outside the game's elite, some of whom packed four matches into 17 days.\nThe rationale given was that with the tournament in a less lucrative time zone, the 'big names' had to be given prime time fixture slots to generate the revenue that would in turn be used to build the game around the world.\nFuimaono-Sapolu criticised 2011's two-speed fixture list, claiming Samoa would have \"killed\" Wales had they, rather than their opponents, had three days' extra rest.\nAs Rugby World's analysis shows, 2015 is more equal but still some way short of the \"completely equal\" promised by Gosper.\nCanada, Tonga, Namibia, Fiji and Romania will twice play matches off the back of four days or less rest, with the tournament's big names all spared tight turnarounds.\nRugby-playing nations are divided into different tiers by World Rugby. These were initially based upon \"playing strength and potential\", but World Rugby's own ranking suggests there is little difference between Italy and Scotland in tier one and Samoa, Tonga and Fiji in the strata below.\nThese classifications matter as they decide the funding and support which flows back to unions from World Cups which, this time around, is expected to generate about \u00a3180m profit.\nWorld Rugby has trumpeted \u00a334m investment in tier two nations since the last World Cup.\nHowever, with less fanfare, the 10 tier one nations have been paid more than double that - \u00a37.5m each - from World Cup coffers to compensate for the revenues they might have earned organising matches during the time of the World Cup.\nWith a \u00a34m fund to be split among all the teams in increasing amounts depending on progress in tournament, even exceptional performance won't carry a huge financial reward for a 'lesser light'.\n\"Those millions of pounds of profit are not World Rugby's money - that is money they owe the tier two nations,\" said Fuimaono-Sapolu.\n\"If you take those 10 tier two nations out there is no 'World' Cup. That is not charity. At the last World Cup, Samoa sold out Hamilton, Eden Park, Albany. That money should come to the tier two already by right and there should be more of it.\"\nInstead, Samoa felt they needed to hold a fundraising drive before the 2011 World Cup, seeking support from a population with an average annual income of \u00a33,371.\nOutside of their World Cup income, the Samoan Rugby Union's chances to make cash are slim.\nUnable to convince big unions to tour - New Zealand's visit this summer was their first - Samoa have to travel to meet tier one opposition.\nBut away days don't pay. Their hosts keep all of the gate money, television receipts and bar takings.\nSo while England's players joined in prayer with their Samoa counterparts after their November test, the RFU retained the estimated \u00a32m generated by an 84,000-sellout and paid Samoa a \u00a345,000 appearance fee.\n\"This money is going to the same people it has gone to for time immemorial. It is neo-colonisation, and a brilliant, fraudulent arrangement,\" added Fuimaono-Sapolu.\nTwenty-five years ago Samoans watched as one of their own, Va'aiga Tuigamala, rampaged through backlines wearing the All Blacks jersey.\nMore recently, they have seen Manu Tuilagi, whose five older brothers have all represented Samoa, doing something similar for England.\nTimes change, but the stream of Samoan talent re-emerging, after three years residency, in the colours of another nation continues.\nSchwalger now runs a rugby academy in Samoa and believes that while it may offend rugby romantics, realists will understand that schooling Samoa's brightest prospects overseas ultimately strengthens the national team.\n\"At the moment, schools in Australia and New Zealand and clubs in Europe are offering our kids opportunities we cannot,\" he says.\n\"We don't have finances, we don't have facilities, we don't have the coaches - so the only way to develop our kids is to send them out.\n\"They can play a better level of rugby out there and hopefully come back and represent Samoa in the future.\n\"Not everyone can play for the All Blacks! Eventually Samoan people will realise that if other countries come over and take our kids, it is a blessing.\"\nAfter Wales famously lost to Western Samoa - as Samoa was formerly known - at the 1991 World Cup, the joke was that Alan Davies' side were lucky they weren't facing the whole of Samoa.\nCome 2015 and the rest of the rugby world might be even luckier not to be facing a Samoa side with the resources and advantages of their opponents.\nFor the latest rugby union news, follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter.", "summary": "Tucked away on page six of the International Rugby Board's November 2004 mission statement is a startling prediction about this year's World Cup.", "id": "34254653"}, {"document": "Germany's federal statistics office Destatis, said the annual rate of inflation fell to 0.2% in December from 0.6% a month earlier.\nThat was its lowest level since October 2009.\nIt comes two days before eurozone inflation figures for December, which some analysts believe will show the currency bloc falling into deflation.\nInflation in the 18-nation currency bloc in November stood at 0.3% according to the European Union's statistics agency, Eurostat.\nIt has been below the Bank's target of 2%, or just below, since the start of 2013.\nA number of other eurozone countries, including Spain and Italy, have already fallen into deflation.\nUsing the European Central Bank's (ECB) preferred statistical calculations -  the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - German inflation was even lower at 0.1% in December.\nThe latest figures will increase pressure on the ECB to begin buying government debt.\nAfter the ECB's December meeting left interest rates unchanged at 0.05%, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said it had \"stepped up\" its preparations to act if needed, and help prop up inflation in the eurozone.\nWhile low inflation leads to lower prices and can be good news for consumers, it can also lead to falling economic activity, job losses and recession.\nConsumers and businesses tend to postpone making purchases or investments in the belief that prices may fall further.\nThis can lead prices even lower to the point where businesses are forced to lay off staff or even close altogether.\nIn the summer the ECB cut interest rates to a new all-time low and began an asset purchase programme to inject cash into the economy to help combat deflation.\nBut big falls in the price of oil, which has fallen more than 50% in the past six months, has had a greater impact on prices, continuing to push them lower.\nJennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said that the fall in German inflation was largely due to lower oil prices, and that the broader eurozone figure was likely to be negative for the first time since October 2009.\nShe added: \"Such a development would surely make the pressure for the ECB to implement quantitative easing at its January meeting irresistible.\"\nBut concerns remain over how the ECB will structure its bond buying programme and whether Greek bonds will be included - given the uncertainty over which political party will win the snap election called for three days after the next ECB meeting.\nThe far-left Syriza party, which has vowed to reverse the austerity measures that were a condition for Greek bailout packages totalling \u00e2\u201a\u00ac240bn (\u00c2\u00a3187bn), holds a narrow lead in opinion polls.", "summary": "Inflation in Germany fell to its lowest level in more than five years in December, official figures have shown.", "id": "30681319"}, {"document": "By clubbing together, 100 households in Bethesda will be able to purchase the power generated by a local hydro scheme for half the price.\nThe aim is to help communities benefit more directly from renewable energy projects in their area.\nSeveral organisations have been involved in pulling the pilot together.\nIt could be rolled out across the country if successful, focusing on areas of high fuel poverty.\nSo how does it work?\nAt the moment, community energy schemes as well as large conventional power stations feed the grid network which transmits electricity to our homes.\nConsumers have no real connection with where or how that electricity is generated - it is just there when they flick on a switch.\nThe trial aims to help communities support green energy projects in their own area. By making sure the power is used locally and does not have to travel for miles, the community gets cheaper bills.\nThe electricity produced by the Bethesda hydro will be split evenly between  club members using energy at any given time.\nEach home will pay 7p/KWh for their share.  That is about half the average price for electricity in the UK, but more than the hydro would usually receive for selling it.\nIt is conceptual - the villagers' homes are not physically plugged into the hydro.  But through the use of smart meters they will be able to show the extent to which they are using power at times when the hydro is generating.\nTo maximise the benefits they will have to change their habits - like using the washing machine or dishwasher after it has been raining and the hydro is running at full pelt, for example.\nCathrin Alwen Llywelyn is one of the homeowners taking part in the Bethesda trial.\n\"I have three children, I'm thinking about the future,\" she said.\n\"We've only got finite resources and so we need to be more aware of the energy we're using.\n\"This is a wonderful opportunity both financially and in a green sense as well.\n\"It's going to be a huge challenge to change our habits around the house in order to save money on our bills.  But this will help us make better choices and that's a good thing.\"\nThose behind the pilot believe each household will be able to save between 10-30% on their electricity bill.\nEnergy Local, a company set up to help communities benefit from locally-owned generation projects, has been coordinating the trial.\nIts founder, Dr Mary Gillie, told BBC Wales that until now the people of Bethesda had not been able to take advantage of the \"amazing renewable resources around them\".\n\"The special thing about the project we're doing is allowing them to share the electricity generated locally within their community,\" she explained.\n\"So they can provide more money for their own hydro through their bills, but also get a lower bill at the same time. It's a win-win.\"\nInitially the villagers are working with a National Trust hydro on the Berthen river but have been fundraising to build another community-owned plant nearby.\nKeith Jones, the trust's environmental adviser in Wales, said he had been blown away by the amount of interest the scheme had received from across the UK.\n\"I'm being emailed or phoned by different people every week. People want to retain more of the benefit of energy generation locally,\" he said.\nThe electricity itself is being supplied by Co-operative Energy, which buys from the hydro and sells it to the households involved, as well as topping them up at times when the hydro is not running.\nHow significant is hydro electricity?\nPowering Wales: Behind the scenes at the National Grid\nMark Billsborough, head of renewable energy at the Co-op, said it had been \"quite difficult to get this working\" and that it \"really is innovative\".\n\"Within the community energy sector we've constantly got people talking to us about this particular scheme - they desperately want to allow their investors and communities to be able to buy their own energy directly from the site,\" he said.\n\"It's the closest things we've got yet to be able to do that.  This is taking a big step into the future.\"\nThe big hope, according to energy experts, is schemes like this one will help customers take more ownership over their electricity use and become more energy conscious.\nIt is also hoped the idea will help with efforts to cut carbon emissions through giving the community energy sector - which includes schemes like small solar farms and wind turbines - a boost.\nDr Gillie described the trial as \"a great step change, turning the energy system upside down\".\n\"Bethesda is a really special place and they deserve to be put on the map for this,\" she added.", "summary": "A \"trail-blazing\" trial in a Gwynedd village could change the way communities up and down the UK buy their electricity, it has been claimed.", "id": "38236414"}, {"document": "New figures show that house price growth is finally slowing down, a bit.\nBut for first-time buyers the average price of a property has actually gone up by 9.7% year-on-year - that's larger than the increase facing previous owners.\nAnd in January the average price paid by a first-time buyer was \u00c2\u00a3210,000.\nGetting a together a deposit to match that kind of figure is often the hardest part of the process.

Now, he comes to the country needing to make an impression for a very different reason - his job is on the line.\nThis idea will be met with dismay by Raikkonen's many adoring fans. For them, the famously taciturn Finn is some kind of demi-god, a prodigious natural talent made all the more attractive by his anti-establishment persona.\nHis grumpy team radio messages and willingness to ignore F1's restrictive codes of behaviour have passed into folklore.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn his way to victory for Lotus in Abu Dhabi in 2012, he demanded his race engineer \"leave me alone, I know what I'm doing\". There is the YouTube video of him falling off the roof of a yacht, apparently drunk. And the time he entered a snowmobile race without Ferrari's permission under the name James Hunt, whom Raikkonen admires, for obvious reasons.\nBut the reality of Raikkonen's performances on track has been more prosaic recently.\nFerrari are unhappy and have left no-one in any doubt that Raikkonen has to up his game if his contract is to be extended into 2016.\n\"Kimi's future is in his own hands,\" says Ferrari's no-nonsense, straight-talking new president, Sergio Marchionne.\nAll this is beginning to tell on Raikkonen, it would appear.\nAt the last race in Austria he lambasted an Italian journalist to whose article on his future he had taken exception.\nRaikkonen finished his discourse with: \"Write what you want; I don't really care.\" When he had spent the previous minute or so suggesting he rather did.\nRaikkonen has always preferred to do his talking on the track. The problem with that is Ferrari do not like what they are hearing. And unless the 35-year-old's performances become a lot more eloquent very soon, he will be out of a job.\nWhat is remarkable about Raikkonen's situation is that it is no more than two months since he and Ferrari seemed to have fallen in love again.\nHe came into 2015 with serious questions hanging over him, having been crushed by former team-mate Fernando Alonso last season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn 19 races, Alonso qualified ahead 16 times, and was an average of 0.529 seconds a lap quicker. Raikkonen scored only 34.2% of the points the Spaniard collected.\nRaikkonen - and his fans - blamed this on the way the 2014 Ferrari behaved. The Finn has always been super-sensitive to the way an F1 car handles and needs a car that turns in sharply and quickly to be at his best.\nLast year's Ferrari lacked front-end grip, a characteristic Alonso could adapt to, but Raikkonen could not.\nFrom the very first day's running of the 2015 Ferrari, Raikkonen was happier. It had a 'positive' front end, and he felt it was a car he could work with.\nThe season started well. He was still lagging behind in qualifying compared to new team-mate Sebastian Vettel but the pace deficit was initially about half that to Alonso and otherwise the two were evenly matched.\nAfter strong performances in the first three grands prix, Raikkonen drove an exceptional race in Bahrain, out-shining Vettel, and finishing second, splitting the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg.\nWith Hamilton's brakes failing, had the race been a lap or two longer, Raikkonen would have won.\nBack in April and early May, Ferrari's only complaint was a wish for Raikkonen to improve his qualifying to stop him compromising his races by having to make up ground at the start. Even then, it was all relative compared to 2014.\nHowever, following Bahrain, Raikkonen finished fifth, sixth and fourth in Spain, Monaco and Canada, in what is undoubtedly F1's second fastest car.\nIn Montreal, where Vettel climbed from 18th on the grid to finish fifth, Raikkonen threw away third place to Williams's Valtteri Bottas with a spin on his first lap after his pit stop.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThen came the last race in Austria, so far his nadir. Raikkonen qualified 18th after failing to get in a lap in the wet in the first part of qualifying and then crashed out of the race on the first lap, taking Alonso's McLaren with him, when he simply lost control of the car under acceleration in fifth gear.\nIt was the sort of mistake that would look bad coming from a novice, let alone someone of Raikkonen's standing, and the reaction of team boss Maurizio Arrivabene in the pits, throwing up his arms in exasperation and uttering what looked suspiciously like an expletive, told you all you needed to know.\nSo what exactly does Marchionne mean when he says Raikkonen's future is in his own hands?\nIt is not just improving his performances on track, although that would be a start, particularly in qualifying.\nHis average deficit to Vettel has grown to 0.471secs over the season so far, excluding the three races where circumstances mean a comparison is not possible. In eight races, the only time Raikkonen has qualified ahead was when Vettel had an engine problem in Canada.\nIn races, things look better, Raikkonen having scored 72 points to Vettel's 120.\nBut Ferrari want more than just results. As one insider puts it: \"He needs to show his commitment by working closely with the team and trying to sort out what his current difficulties are.\"\nIn two different qualifying sessions, his chances have been hit by what Raikkonen claimed were miscommunications with the pits, but which Ferrari feel were at least partially the driver's fault.\nIn Malaysia, he failed to get in a lap in the frantic seconds before a huge rain shower hit, and missed the cut-off for the top 10 shoot-out.\nWhen he blamed the team publicly for that, Arrivabene took him aside for a stern conversation to make it clear he did not want to hear that again.\nIn Austria, where he qualified 18th in slippery conditions, Raikkonen said his failure was due to his engineers not telling him he did not have time for another go, after he had made a mistake on his first lap. Others said, yes, sure, he should have got in a time in the first place.\nFor his spin in the race in Canada, Raikkonen blamed a post-pit stop engine mode that gave him an unexpected boost in power. The team point out that this mode is standard and that it caused Vettel no trouble.\nThen there was the crash in Austria. Even Alonso called it \"strange\", so bizarre was it to see Raikkonen lose control in that way.\nFerrari have investigated it and can find nothing wrong with the car, no evidence of contact from anyone else, only a sudden loss of grip. Nothing, in other words, to contradict Alonso's assessment that Raikkonen simply lost it, caught by surprise by a combination of the high torque levels of modern F1 engines and the low-grip track surface at the Red Bull Ring.\nIn Raikkonen's favour, the tracks coming up - particularly Silverstone and Spa in Belgium - are places where he has excelled in the past. He needs to do so more than ever now.\nOfficially, Ferrari insist no final decision has been on Raikkonen's future.\n\"There are many, many things to consider and now is too early to tell him something or to decide something,\" Arrivabene says.\n\"I could look too defensive or protecting Kimi, but we are not even halfway through the season.\n\"Try to be in my position, and [imagine the effect of] going to Kimi to say you are out or you are in or whatever. I want the guys to be concentrated on what they are doing and to give the maximum.\"\nThis is not, clearly, a ringing endorsement, but it tallies with the official line that Ferrari have plenty of time to make up their minds.\nHowever, sources close to the team say that the decision to drop Raikkonen has effectively already been taken - and only a remarkable turnaround in form over the next three or four races will change their minds.\nIf Ferrari do let him go, that is likely to be the end of Raikkonen's F1 career, for he has already said he will not go to another team if Ferrari do not want him.\nWho would Ferrari replace Raikkonen with? Their number one choice is Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo. According to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, Ferrari \"had a sniff\" at the Australian last year, before plumping for Vettel, but did not go as far as offering any money.\nRicciardo negotiated a new contract with Red Bull over the winter that locks him to the team until 2018, and Horner says they would not consider selling him.\nBut if Ferrari come calling, Red Bull may have no choice. You can't make a man work where he does not want to and, given the problems with Red Bull's Renault engine at the moment, Ricciardo might well fancy a change. Plus, Ferrari has a lure like no other team, and Ricciardo has Italian heritage.\nAs a parenthetical point, Ricciardo leaving might actually do Red Bull a favour in the long term, as with two young drivers in him and Daniil Kvyat at the lead team, and two highly promising novices in Carlos Sainz Jr and Max Verstappen in Toro Rosso, there is a bit of a logjam in the Red Bull staircase of talent at the moment.\nFerrari's main concern about Ricciardo is the potentially destabilising effect signing him might have on Vettel. Ricciardo out-shone the four-time champion last year at Red Bull and Ferrari are very happy with Vettel and might prefer not to rock the boat.\nIf it's not Ricciardo, their second choice is Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nTheir interest in Bottas, which peaked last autumn, has waned, because he is struggling this year to out-pace team-mate Felipe Massa, who was dropped by Ferrari in 2013 after four seasons of being made to look ordinary by Alonso and was evenly matched with Raikkonen when they were team-mates from 2007-9.\nThey are also facing pressure from their Mexican sponsors to promote Mexican reserve driver Esteban Gutierrez, however unqualified the former Sauber man appears to be for a race seat at F1's biggest and most famous team.", "summary": "Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen is under increasing pressure as he heads to Silverstone for this weekend's British Grand Prix.", "id": "33291701"}, {"document": "Twenty-two homes on the Nant y Felin estate in Pentraeth were evacuated during the blaze on Friday but residents have since returned to their homes\nIt broke out at a petrol station in Pentraeth at about 04:50 BST.\nThe A5025 between Menai Bridge and Amlwch had to be closed for a while while the blaze was tackled.", "summary": "An investigation has been launched after a large fire at a petrol station on Anglesey.", "id": "32181214"}, {"document": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) affects 3,000 people in Wales and 20,000 in the UK.\nA new drug has been developed that targets cancer cells, stopping them in their tracks before they have time to multiply and travel through the body.\nScientists said the disease would become less of a clinical problem.\nA team at the institute of cancer and genetics at the University Hospital of Wales has been working on the project which has been led by Prof Chris Pepper, who has worked on the disease for 20 years.\n\"These drugs will transform the outlook for patients, without a doubt,\" he said.\n\"They are massively going to change the landscape for individual sufferers of this disease.\n\"I confidently predict that within 10 years certainly, and probably five years, this disease will become much less of a clinical problem.\n\"And people like me won't be working on this disease much longer.

It had recently undergone a mid-life upgrade in Russia.\nThe $80m (\u00c2\u00a352m) retrofit equipped it with anti-ship and land attack 200km (124 mile)-range cruise missile systems.\nThe submarine's hull was also refurbished and numerous other systems were upgraded to enhance its safety and security, adding at least an additional 10 years to its 25-year service life.\nSindhurakshak's cooling system likewise underwent modifications, fitted with a Porpoise radio-locator to enhance its capabilities.\nOfficial sources say it is \"highly unlikely\" that the Indian navy and the Russians will be able to resurrect Sindhurakshak and that will add to the navy's operational woes as it faces a severe depletion of its ageing sub-surface fleet.\nBy 2014-15, the navy will be left with only nine of its current fleet of 14 diesel-electric submarines that include eight Russian Kilo-class and four German Type 1500 (HDW209) boats.\nBeyond the planned expansion of its nuclear submarine capabilities, the navy in addition faces severe difficulties with its conventional underwater assets.\nDelivery dates between 2012 and 2017 for the $4.2bn programme to build six French Scorpene diesel-electric patrol submarines under licence at the state-owned Mazagaon Dockyard Limited in Mumbai has been pushed back following bitter financial wrangling and technical problems.\nIndian navy officials said the first Scorpene was now scheduled for delivery three years later than planned, most likely around late 2015, and the sixth and last by 2019-20.\nIndian government auditors - the Comptroller and Auditor General - in a recent report warned that the navy faced the danger of operating with less than half its already deficient submarine fleet by 2012-13 when 63% of its boats would be eligible for retirement.\nThe watchdog revealed that \"other than holding 67% of the submarines envisaged in its 1985 Maritime Perspective Plan, the average operational availability between January 2002 and December 2006 of the existing boats was as low as 48% due to prolonged refit schedules\".\nAccording to the auditors, 83% of short submarine refits and 100% of \"normal and medium refits\" invariably were delayed well past the prescribed time period.\nThis was because many of the Sindugosh (Type 877 Kilo-class) boats - of which Sindhurakshak was one - needed to be sent to Russia.\n\"With serious slippages in the induction plan, the navy is left with an ageing fleet with more than 50% of submarines having completed 75% of their operational life and some already outliving their maximum service life,\" the report said.\nThe navy's plans to import two submarines and locally build four to make good the shortfall has been entangled in bureaucratic wrangling for several years.\nWhile the navy is keen on involving private shipyards, the defence ministry wants three submarines built at the Mazagaon Dockyard Limited, despite it being overburdened with orders, and one at the public sector Hindustan Shipyard in Visakhapatnam on the east coast.", "summary": "The explosion aboard  INS Sindhurakshak, a recently upgraded conventional Indian navy submarine, on Wednesday morning at a dockyard in Mumbai will be a major setback to navy's operational preparedness.", "id": "23691558"}, {"document": "Gone are the steady jobs and home ownership of yore.\nGone too is married life - more 18-34 year-olds live with their parents than with a spouse.\nThe US Census Bureau report found that the extent to which young people reached milestones like living alone was \"tied to economic security\".\nBut some of their expectations of what it means to be an adult have changed.\nIn these hard economic times, then, about a third of millennials still live at home with their parents.\nLast year, research found it was the most common living arrangement for young adults - for the first time in 130 years.\nThere are 24 million 18-34-year-olds, among whom there are more men than women. And of them, 2.2. million are not studying or working.\nSome of those who stay at home have disabilities or poor health, but it seems many are just priced out of moving out.\nWeirdly, though, this study counts college dorms as being \"at home\". Maybe because they think it's parents who pay for that?\nThe study compared the 18-34 year old age group with young adults in 1975, their parents' generation.\nSo what's changed between then and now? A few things:\nBack then, eight in 10 people were married by 30. Now, young people wait longer. By the age of 45, eight in 10 are married too.\nMaybe it's because they don't see family as a marker of adulthood in the way their parents might have done; more than half of young Americans today say marrying and having children are not very important for becoming an adult.\nThe state where young people were most likely to be living in their own household was North Dakota, where 60% of young people were living alone or with a partner or spouse.\nMillennials these days believe in getting a good education. More than 60% said finishing school was very important for becoming an adult.\nMore women work outside the home nowadays - it's one of the biggest changes highlighted in the report. Only 14% of 25-34 year-old women are homemakers now, compared to 43% in 1975.\nThis change drove an overall boost; young people today are more likely to be employed year-round than their parents were at the same age.\nOnly a quarter of men had low incomes in 1975 (annual salaries of less than $30,000 - \u00c2\u00a323,500 - in 2015 money).

Debris from the aircraft had been spread across an area of about four hectares (10 acres), about 1,550m up the mountainside in a sloping rocky ravine.\nAs well as gathering evidence, requests will also be made for copies of documentation - maintenance records and passenger lists - that will be held by the airline.\nCommunications with air traffic control will be sought as well as information about weather conditions at the time of the crash.\nAccording to rules set out under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the primary role in the probe goes to the state where the crash happened, but the states where the aircraft was registered, where the airline is based and where the plane was designed can all have a role.\nThis process is complicated where the crash happens over water, as with Air France flight 447, which crashed over the Atlantic en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in June 2009.\nIt took almost two years for the flight's \"black box\" data recorders to be recovered from the ocean and another year for the final report to be issued by the French aviation authority.\nSinai plane crash: Four theories\nRussian plane crash: What we know\nCould Islamic State have bombed Flight 9268?\nOnce the investigators are in a position to assess the physical evidence, they have to keep an open mind and not narrow down the focus of their efforts too early.\nBefore long, the wreckage is normally re-assembled in the nearest suitable building. In the case of the Lockerbie crash in Scotland in 1988, that was initially done in an ex-military base where the wreckage was pieced together \"in 2D\" on the floor before being moved to the English town of Farnborough, where it could be re-constructed in 3D.\nIt is that physical evidence, even if it is initially hidden or distorted by the impact of hitting the ground or other factors, that can start to suggest lines of inquiry, along with the \"black box\" and cockpit voice recorder.\nThe results of autopsies performed on passengers and crew can also help narrow down what happened on board.\nFor example, the Dutch report into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 over Ukraine in July 2014 said it was able to determine the nature of the impact that brought it down partially because of the sorts of injuries sustained by the crew in the cockpit.\nAfter the initial phase of gathering physical intelligence, it is normally possible to form a view of the physical process that brought the aircraft down - for example, an explosion.\nCurled pieces of metal from the fuselage can suggest this, for example, but this would have to be evident on more than one piece of debris in order to support the theory.\n\"In most cases, the evidence will be there from the wreckage as to what happened. But then it's about why,\" says Frank Taylor, a former air accident investigator who worked on the Lockerbie crash.\nIn UK law, accident investigators have control over the probe for as long as they deem it necessary, but trying to get to the bottom of why the accident happened can be where other agencies start to intervene.\n\"The accident investigation process is very strictly a no-blame process,\" Mr Taylor says.\nIf investigators believe they have found a design or maintenance fault, they can issue recommendations immediately in order to try to prevent the problem happening to other aircraft, long before any final report is published.\nSometimes, as on 9/11, it is immediately apparent that a crime has occurred, at which point police and prosecutors will normally start conducting their own investigations in parallel, combing intelligence to look for clues as to who might be responsible.", "summary": "When faced with the aftermath of a plane crash, how do investigators try to piece together the facts?", "id": "34745186"}, {"document": "Guzman, the head of the Sinaloa drugs cartel, was captured on Friday after escaping from a prison in Mexico last year, the second such breakout he's managed to pull off.\nGuzman had been charged with drug trafficking and murder.

These 1-3m lumps and bumps may be the original icy building blocks that came together to form 67P more than 4.5 billion years ago.\n\"All the goosebumps we have observed on the comet \u2013 they are inside these pits,\" said Dr Vincent.\nRosetta and the comet are currently about 290 million km from Earth and heading in towards the Sun.\nNext month marks perihelion, when 67P makes its closest approach to our star, before then sweeping back out into the outer Solar System.\nThe separation between the comet and the Sun at that point will be some 186 million km, and the increased warmth will drive still more activity. Already, the object is producing spectacular jets, and they will only get more intense.\nIn addition to making its own observations, Rosetta is also talking to the lander, Philae, which it dropped on to the surface of the comet last November.\nPhilae has recently come back to life after a period in hibernation.\nBut Esa controllers need to establish a stable communications link through Rosetta before the little lander can be commanded to resume science observations.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "The comet being studied by Europe\u2019s Rosetta probe is riddled with pits that formed much like sinkholes here on Earth, say scientists.", "id": "33354872"}, {"document": "Chopra, 80, died on Sunday.

I was amazed Chelsea let him join one of their rivals, a team that are trying to catch them up.\nFrom what he has been saying this week, Blues boss Antonio Conte was surprised it was allowed to happen too - especially because Tiemoue Bakayoko is still not fit.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI know Matic is 29 and cost \u00a340m, but he has got at least another two or three good years left in him, and he is exactly what United needed in midfield.\nHaving him in the team will give Paul Pogba more freedom to get forward and I am expecting to see an improvement from him.\nWe will see more from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford too.\nWe will have to wait and see whether Rashford gets the chance to lead the line or has to play to one side of Lukaku, but this should still be a big season for him before next summer's World Cup.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd then there is Mourinho himself. More often than not, he finds a way to win, which is another reason I make United slight favourites.\nIn Lukaku, Matic and centre-half Victor Lindelof, he has bought three more players to turn United into the team he wants them to be, and he is not finished yet - I think he is after one or two more this month as well.\nThe big question marks over City are how will they do defensively and, as part of that, can they keep Vincent Kompany fit?\nJohn Stones will have to do a lot better because, for a \u00a347.5m centre-half, he had a pretty poor start to his time at City.\nHe made some mistakes but even when he had a good game he was in and out of the team. It was a really stop-start season for him and I did not think he ever really got going.\nHe is a year older now and he will have learned from those experiences, but to make progress he has to form a proper partnership at the back and, the more he plays with Kompany, the better he will become.\nThey only started two league games together in 2016-17, when it would have done Stones a lot of good to have his captain alongside him.\nChelsea are the defending champions and when you go through their strongest XI, they are still as good as anyone else.\nBut their issue is they need more players because they have Champions League football to deal with this season too.\nThey have let a lot of squad players go, so even after signing Bakayoko, Antonio Rudiger and Alvaro Morata as like-for-like replacements for Matic, John Terry and Diego Costa, who looks like leaving too, they are still down numbers-wise.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nChelsea have to go out and make two or three signings in the next couple of weeks, and Tottenham are in the same boat because they also need to bolster their squad.\nHaving to play at Wembley already makes things more difficult for Mauricio Pochettino's side, because the opposition will raise their game there.\nSpurs have just fallen short in the league in the past couple of seasons and not signing anyone to try to push on now would be a huge error on their part.\nSpurs are at the stage where they will need to start winning things soon if they want to keep hold of their best players. It really needs to happen for them this season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Premier League season always starts before the summer transfer window shuts but, this year in particular, it feels like some big deals could be done that would change things at the top of the table.\nTwo of them involve Liverpool. Firstly, will Philippe Coutinho go to Barcelona? If he leaves Anfield, Liverpool can forget about challenging for the title.\nOn the other hand, the Reds want Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk and, if they were to get him and keep Coutinho, they will not be too far away.\nAlexis Sanchez's future at Arsenal has not been resolved yet either and there still seems to be a lot of uncertainty around the Gunners, even after Arsene Wenger signed a new two-year contract.\nAt the moment they have got Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all entering the final year of their contracts. My guess is that is about \u00a3100m of talent at least.\nIf all three leave for free in 12 months' time, you miss out on that money and also have to splash out on replacing them.\nAltogether we are talking about the best part of \u00a3200m and, I don't care how rich their owner Stan Kroenke is, that is still a heck of a lot of money whether you are a billionaire or not.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI liked the look of Alexandre Lacazette's link-up play in the Community Shield and he adds something different to the Gunners' attack but, at the moment, it does not seem that much else about Arsenal has changed.\nEven if they keep all three of those players for this season, I still don't see them having enough to challenge for the title.\nMy old team Newcastle are back in the Premier League and, for them, this season is all about staying there.\nMagpies boss Rafael Benitez has already said as much - I spoke to him this week for Football Focus and he was open and honest about their situation and how it will be a battle to stay up.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBenitez compared what Newcastle have spent - which is about \u00a330m on four players - to the \u00a320m or \u00a325m that Bournemouth and Leicester have paid for just one.\nThat shows where Newcastle are at, and what they are up against.

East Jerusalem's checkpoints are not like the ones around the West Bank and Gaza; they are much more informal affairs. But they are, for the first time since 1967, restricting access to and from largely Arab East Jerusalem.\nHow long they will last is difficult to call. East Jerusalem's residents have the right to move freely through the city and Israel. It doesn't seem feasible to cut off whole neighbourhoods for long.

Police shot dead one of the assailants and wounded the other.\nJust a few minutes later, another Palestinian rammed his car into a bus stop before getting out and stabbing people. The attacker was fatally shot by a security guard.\nThere were also two separate knife attacks in Raanana, a town in central Israel. Police identified the assailants as Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.\nClashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers meanwhile continued in the West Bank after Palestinian activists called for a \"day of rage\".\nPalestinian medics said one Palestinian was killed by Israeli fire in Bethlehem.\nThe BBC's Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the violence, coming at a time when peace prospects seem dim, has fuelled a sense of panic in Israel and raised fears of a new Palestinian uprising, or intifada.\nThere has been a spate of stabbings of Israelis - several of them fatal - by Palestinians since early October, and one apparent revenge stabbing by an Israeli. The attackers have struck in Jerusalem and central and northern Israel, and in the occupied West Bank. Israel has tightened security and its security forces have clashed with rioting Palestinians, leading to deaths on the Palestinian side. The violence has also spread to the border with Gaza.\nAfter a period of relative quiet, violence between the two communities has spiralled since clashes erupted at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site in mid-September. It was fuelled by rumours among Palestinians that Israel was attempting to alter a long-standing religious arrangement governing the site. Israel repeatedly dismissed the rumours as incitement. Soon afterwards, two Israelis were shot dead by Palestinians in the West Bank and the stabbing attacks began. Both Israel and the Palestinian authorities have accused one another of doing nothing to protect each other's communities.\nThere have been two organised uprisings by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, in the 1980s and early 2000s. With peace talks moribund, some observers have questioned whether we are now seeing a third.

No drug-dealing is allowed on the premises and no alcohol is sold in the cafeteria, but there are places for smoking and sniffing as well as injecting.\nUsers of the rooms must be at least 18 years of age and be a dependent drug user with official documentation, casual users are not allowed to use the rooms.\nVancouver has the only legal drug consumption room in North America. It operates under a special exemption from the country's drug laws which it nearly lost in 2008.

Half a million more patients seen in A&E than in the previous year, more than one million appointments booked or cancelled online, an increase in the NHS workforce, almost \u00c2\u00a31bn invested over five years in infrastructure to boost research.\nBut read on and the more difficult truths begin to emerge.\nThe report, covering the 2016-17 financial year, acknowledges that many of the key performance targets were missed, including the proportion of patients assessed or treated in A&E within four hours, which fell further below the 95% target to 89.1%.\nThere is understandable emphasis on the increasing pressures on the service with demand rising \"above what would typically be expected from population growth and demographics alone\" and the NHS delivering record levels of activity.\nLooking for reasons for the drop in hospital performance, the report inevitably gets to the issue of delayed transfers of medically fit patients and the resulting bed shortages. The scale of the problem is underlined by the astonishing 24.5% increase in bed days lost because of these delayed transfers, to 2.3 million from 1.8 million the previous year.  Hospitals were left full to capacity, sometimes unable to admit new patients.\nIt's noted that local authorities are working with health leaders in each area to reduce the numbers of patients held in hospital beds because there is no social care package available. There is a bold statement that \"this will be an area of improvement in 2017-18\".\nThe government has told NHS England that the delayed transfer number must be reduced to 3.5% of total bed occupancy by September. But it's hard to see much progress in that direction so far.\nAn interesting analysis by NHS Providers, due out soon, highlights the continuing scale of the delayed transfer problem. The organisation points out that community hospitals have a far higher proportion of beds occupied by people who are fit to leave (20.8% in February) than the larger acute hospitals (5.1%).\nDelayed transfers can occur when an NHS community facility is unable to take patients from acute care or when either type of NHS hospital can't discharge patients because social care is not available.\nThe research also points out that in March this year there were more than three times as many delayed days due to \"patients awaiting a care package in their own home\" compared with April 2014.\nNHS Providers concludes that the September target of 3.5% of beds occupied by patients whose transfer has been held up is looking highly unrealistic.  That level has not been achieved for nearly three years and the latest quarterly current figure across all NHS hospitals in England was 5.6%.\nThe government has pumped \u00c2\u00a31bn extra into social care in England this year in part to help tackle the causes of the delayed discharges of patients from hospitals. One of the aims is to free up NHS beds to cope with rising emergency admissions and the backlog of routine operations.\nBut with local authorities pointing out that there are many other social care issues to tackle with the money, it's still not clear whether the new funding will make a significant dent in the delayed transfer numbers.\nIt's the height of summer and NHS leaders and politicians are preparing for their holidays. Their minds will not be on bed occupancy and social care.\nThe Department of Health report and the NHS Providers analysis will be parked up in office in-trays and inboxes.

outlined in a White Paper in February - which envisages leaving the single market and customs union.\nWhen critics of the prime minister talk about a \"hard Brexit\", they basically mean that she has decided to leave the EU single market and the customs union.\nTheresa May prefers to call her plans a \"clean Brexit\".\nMembership of the EU single market means there are no taxes or tariffs on trade between all the countries involved, and they abide by a common set of rules and regulations.\nBut it also means every member country has to accept the free movement of people - something the government wants to bring to an end.\nIn 2016, about 44% of the UK's exports in goods and services went to other countries in the EU.\nMembership of the customs union means all the countries involved have agreed to apply the same tariffs on goods coming from elsewhere in the world.\nOnce they have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped around the union without further tariffs being imposed.\nBut being part of the customs union also means you cannot negotiate your own trade deals with other countries around the world.\nMrs May wants the UK to be able to negotiate on its own once the UK leaves the EU.\nThe UK wants to negotiate its own free trade deal with the EU after Brexit.\nIf it fails to do so, or if the Article 50 negotiations on leaving the EU break down, then it will leave with \"no deal\" on the table.\nThat means it will have to fall back on its membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the basis for its future trading relationship with the EU, and it will have to accept a schedule of tariffs on goods imported from or exported to the single market.\nThe \"no deal\" scenario worries many businesses - especially if it were to happen with little notice.\nThat could be because negotiations with the EU break down, or because a proposed deal gets rejected by one party or another at the last minute.\nTariffs aren't a one-way street.\nIf trade between the UK and the EU were to be conducted \"under WTO terms\", the EU would also have to pay tariffs on goods it exports to the UK.\nIn cash terms, the EU would have more to lose - in 2016, the UK exported goods worth \u00a3144bn to the EU, and the EU exported goods worth \u00a3240bn to the UK.\nBut in percentage terms, the UK has more to lose - in 2015, 47% of UK goods exports went to the EU, while only about 16% of EU goods exports went to the UK, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).\nWhat are Brexit Britain's trade options?\nThe service sector is a huge part of the UK economy - accounting for about 80% of the total.\nServices are often not covered in a free trade deal, which is why this is likely to be the most difficult part of the future UK-EU trade relationship to resolve.\nThe key is what are known as \"non-tariff barriers\".\nThese include things such as mutual recognition of regulations, and rules on everything from legal standards to the environment.\nThe financial services sector is particularly concerned about losing its financial \"passports\".\nThese allow any company operating within the single market to trade across the EU without the need for separate licences.\nEvidence provided to the Treasury Select Committee last year showed that more than 5,000 UK-based financial firms relied on these passports to trade elsewhere in the EU.\nThe passports will need to be replaced by a new regime.\nBut negotiations on services agreements often drag on for years - which is why it is likely that there will need to be some kind of transition period lasting several years between full EU membership and a new relationship in the future.\nSome sectors of the UK economy are certainly worried about that, because they rely on large numbers of workers coming from other EU countries.\nIf a deal can be done on guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens in the UK (and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU) then it shouldn't have an immediate effect, because no-one will be forced to leave.\nBut in the longer term, concern has been expressed about everything from the NHS to fruit-picking companies, and from coffee bars to professional football clubs.\nOnce the government has decided on a new immigration policy to replace free movement, it will have to decide whether to grant exemptions to allow specific companies or sectors of the economy to bring more people in from other EU countries if they are needed.\nWhen it comes to all of the issues discussed here - tariffs, customs, and migration - the main thing most businesses want is clarity.\nThat will allow them to plan ahead, and make the transition from EU membership to a new relationship as smooth as possible.\nBusinesses give their priorities for Brexit talks\nRead more on Reality Check", "summary": "When Theresa May formally signed a letter triggering the UK's departure from the EU, in March, the prime minister fired the starting gun on a two-year negotiation process that will have far-reaching implications for British businesses.", "id": "39858788"}, {"document": "The man got out of his van and walked over to the lorry after being held up during rounds on the Tan y Bryn Estate in Valley.\nWhen the driver rolled down his window the man spat in his face before leaving, officials said.\nThey called the attack \"disgusting and cowardly\".\nBiffa, who have held the contract for collecting waste on Anglesey since 2004, said the incident was a \"new low\" for the company.\nRegional manager Andrew Dutton said: \"This was an unprovoked attack on a member of staff who was out doing his job for the community.\"\nMeirion Edwards of Anglesey council said the incident was cowardly.\n\"We realise that sometimes people get annoyed if they're held up by recycling lorries, but all we ask for is a little patience,\" he said.\n\"Unfortunately, this incident wasn't captured on CCTV -

and it was clear this stage suits him as he faced the media in Amsterdam.\nHaving secured owner Roman Abramovich's main priority of a place in next season's Champions League, Benitez can provide an added bonus and add weight to his carefully cultivated CV by beating Benfica on Wednesday.\nMuch has been made of Benitez's desire to add a trophy to his own list of honours before taking his leave after Sunday's final home game against Everton, in the manner of a personal vanity project - but a coach wanting to add to his reputation by winning honours is hardly a crime.\nBenitez was relaxed in familiar surroundings, once more declining to offer any apology when asked about comments relating to Chelsea before his arrival. Smiling he replied: \"A manager has to defend his club and I'm defending Chelsea now.\"\nAnd as Chelsea trained, he was in his element, although there was a certain irony at the ineligible Demba Ba hitting the back of the net from all angles while Fernando Torres looked out of sorts.\nBenitez spent a long spell in conversation with Torres during training, no doubt reminding the rather sullen striker he has been Chelsea's specialist since they dropped out of the Champions League and into the Europa League after a dismal defence of their crown.\nRarely has Benitez looked more relaxed, observing from the sidelines before a lengthy and animated discussion with Ramires and David Luiz. And even when Chelsea's players returned to the dressing room he stayed behind to pose for pictures and sign autographs with observers inside this magnificent stadium.\nBenfica will present dangerous opponents under coach Jorge Jesus, a man on a personal mission to end the Eagles' run of 51 years without a European trophy, which has included six defeats in major finals.\nJesus wants that curse ended and the quality they have displayed in this tournament marks them out as formidable opposition, but Benitez has a list of victims in European combat that stands the closest scrutiny. AC Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan all fell to his Liverpool sides.\nFor Benitez, there is the possibility of forcing Chelsea's followers into accepting his time at Stamford Bridge was fruitful by presenting tangible evidence, while making himself more attractive to prospective employers. He wishes to stay in the Premier League but he also had to deal with inquiries about possible interest from Napoli when he faced the media.\nBenitez's history, his ability to craft victories in one-off European games, has been much of his stock in trade. And, while there was not exactly warmth towards him from Chelsea fans gathering in Amsterdam, there was a quiet, almost whispered, acceptance that he is due some credit should they beat Benfica.\nOne man less likely to be coming to the end of his Chelsea career is Frank Lampard. The expected arrival of Jose Mourinho has increased the prospect of him staying after he became the club's all-time record goalscorer, taking his tally to 203 with both goals in Saturday's 2-1 win at Aston Villa.\nFew would bet against this remarkable player adding goal number 204 in his 607th appearance for Chelsea and he is likely to lead them, as he did in last season's Champions League final win, because John Terry has an ankle injury.\nLampard and goalkeeper Petr Cech were at pains to point out Chelsea were not in pursuit of a consolation prize in the shape of the Europa League. These serious professionals are chasing a serious trophy.

But for the benefit of those who would rather a castle was their home, BBC News takes a look at some that have been up for sale.\nWigmore Castle may seem a bit of a disappointment to those seeking a baronial lifestyle, as it is now a ruin.\nBut don't let that put you off. The castle, originally a wooden edifice, is believed to date back to the 10th Century. Its past, involves murder, treachery and, brilliantly, a woman called Lady Brilliana.\nIt was Lady Brilliana who was responsible for turning the castle into ruins, when in 1643 she ordered Parliamentarian troops to dismantle the walls to prevent it from being used by opposition forces.\nAs an added bonus, the Grade I-listed building is in the guardianship of the secretary of state, so the new owners would have no liability for repairs.\nAs well as the ruins, situated near Leominster in Herefordshire, the buyer will get about 32 acres, including a moat, some woodland, a jousting field, workshop and orchards.\nPerhaps the jousting field will attract a new owner from the US state of Maryland - jousting became its official individual sport in 1962, and the state holds tournaments throughout the summer.\nThe official team sport, by the way, is lacrosse.\nDriffield Castle is perhaps even less prepossessing than Wigmore Castle, being a grassy mound.\nBut the earthwork monument, on Moot Hill, is protected because it's archaeologically important.\nUnderneath the 11th Century motte and bailey fortress are believed to be the remains of Aldfrith, the king of Northumbria (685-704).\nIf you are lucky enough to find one of the silver sceattas - coins minted in his reign - they sell for more than \u00a31,500.  They have Aldfrith's name on one side, and a creature - which experts have variously described as a lion or a horse - with a three-pointed tail on the other.\nDriffield Castle was sold in 2011 for \u00a323,000.\nCaverswall Castle, currently up for sale for \u00a33m, is a tad more luxurious than most. It has 16 bedrooms, a moat, three converted turrets, an orangery and a dungeon.\nIt was built on the site of an Anglo-Saxon Manor in 1275, and the earliest recorded owner was Ernuf de Hesing. The castle then passed to Sir William de Caverswall, who in 1230 received a \"license to crenellate\" or fortify the house.\nThe castle fell into decay until 1615 when the Mayor of Stafford Matthew Cradon, a wealthy merchant, bought and rebuilt it as a Jacobean mansion in about 1625.\nDuring the English Civil War it was used as a garrison by Parliamentary forces, and the Wedgewood pottery family lived there during the 1880s.\nPerhaps the occupants who left the most lasting legacy was an order of Benedictine nuns.\nThe castle became became a sanctuary to the order which had escaped the French Revolution. It is rumoured one of the nuns haunts the place.\nDinton Castle, which sold in 2012 for \u00a356,000, is an octagonal folly built in 1769 on a Saxon burial ground by Sir John Vanhattem.\nSir John used it to store his collection of fossils - not inside the building but set into its walls.\nRumours abound that the folly is haunted by John Bigg, who died in 1696.\nKnown as the \"Dinton Hermit\", his shoe is on display at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.\nBigg was a clerk to Simon Mayne, an Aylesbury magistrate and MP, who owned Dinton Hall.\nMayne was one of the judges at the trial of King Charles I in 1649, and it is said Bigg may have been one of the hooded executioners of the king.\nMayne was eventually tried and sentenced as a regicide and died in the Tower of London in 1661.\nBigg became a hermit, living in an underground cave at Dinton Hall, until his death.\nSome believe it was because he feared retribution for his involvement in the royal execution, while others suggest it was due to the remorse he felt over the king's death.\nHis shoe was given to the museum by Sir John Vanhattem. It's made up of hundreds of patches of leather, which the hermit nailed on top of each other as each piece wore out.\nAn 18th Century illustration of Bigg shows the rest of his clothes were also made up from patches of leather and he wore a strange horned cloak. It is said that he lived by begging silently for food but only ever asked for leather - and, presumably, nails.\nWestenhanger Castle, which went on the market in 2013 for \u00a32.6m, was owned by King Cnut - the ruler who pointed out even a monarch could not stop the tide coming in.\nCnut gave it to a local archbishop in 1035 in the hope it would ease his passage to heaven.\nIn 1540 the property was transferred to the Crown by Henry VIII who, until his death seven years later, entertained lady friends there.\nHis daughter Queen Elizabeth also used the castle, hosting house parties of more than 300 people.\nThe current building is Grade I listed and on the site of a 14th Century fortification with ruins.\nWestenhanger Castle also has a full-size replica of the Discovery - one of the three ships that sailed to Jamestown, Virginia - where the first permanent English-speaking settlement in the New World was established - forming a base for what would later become the United States of America.\nWestenhanger used to be owned by Thomas Smythe, a collector of customs duties. His son, another Thomas, became the treasurer of the Virginia Company and obtained settlement rights in Jamestown.\nBlenkinsopp Castle is thought to have been built in 1339 by Thomas de Blecansopp. One of his descendants, Bryan de Blenkinsopp, was said to be so motivated by wealth he married a woman who was unattractive but had an awful lot of gold.\nThe chest containing her riches was supposedly so heavy it took 12 men to carry it.\nBut Sir Bryan did not benefit from his mercantile marriage. His wife refused tell him where she and her servants had hidden her chest and, true to form,  he left her - after which she disappeared.\nIt was hinted at the time that the lady was an imp of darkness, sent with her wealth to ensnare Sir Bryan's greedy soul.

The oil price fall looks longer-term, and has returned to the downside in recent weeks.\nBP is not alone in reporting a sharp drop in earnings, relying on its downstream refining to prop up the upstream problems. Later this week, Royal Dutch Shell reports on its half-year figures.\nStatoil of Norway on Monday reported a fall in second-quarter profits from 32.3bn kroner (\u00a32.5bn) to 22.4bn kroner (\u00a31.75bn), beating market expectations. Production has gone up, following investment and lower maintenance requirements this year, and the company has been hammering down on costs, including job losses.\nLike BP, it is sharply cutting investment spend. Companies in offshore exploration and production don't see the return they need at current oil prices.\nWood Mackenzie, the energy analyst, reckons $200bn (\u00a3128bn) of oil industry investment has been postponed this year, with the lion's share of that in offshore, and another chunk in Canada's tar sands. That keeps 20 billion barrels of oil (and gas equivalent) in the ground and under the seabed, at least until prices rise.\nAnd as in the the previous quarter, BP found little to shout about from its exploration activities. Its \"upstream\" business reported an underlying pre-tax replacement cost profit (RCP) of $0.5bn in the three months to June, compared with $0.6bn three months earlier and $4.7bn for the same period a year earlier.\nRCP is a measure of profitability used by the oil industry that takes into account the price of oil.\nBP set the blame squarely on lower oil and gas prices.\nIt said the results also included about $600m of exploration write-offs and other costs related to BP's activities in war-torn Libya.\nThat meant once again that BP's profits came from its refinery or \"downstream\" business.\nThere, it reported underlying pre-tax RCP of $1.9bn, compared with $2.2bn in the first quarter and $0.7bn in the same period year ago.\nBP also said it would maintain its dividend at 10 cents per ordinary share. That may help to calm investors after the company missed analysts' estimates that it would make $1.6bn in the quarter.", "summary": "BP has reported a sharp fall in profits for the three months to the end of June as lower oil prices continue to hurt.", "id": "33677186"}, {"document": "The 18-year-old midfielder, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal, was the subject of a rejected bid from Newcastle United earlier in the month.\nBBC Sport understands the deal does not include a buy-back option.\nThe highly-rated youngster, whose Old Trafford contract would have run out this summer, was part of United's FA Youth Cup winning side last year.\nBut United boss Sir Alex Ferguson recently branded Morrison's contract demands as \"unrealistic\".\nFerguson handed the Wythenshawe-born player his senior debut in the Carling Cup in 2010 against Wolves, but the youngster has also had a chequered history off the pitch.\nTwo days after winning the 2011 FA Cup Youth final, the 18-year-old was fined \u00a3600 by a court for throwing his girlfriend's mobile phone through a window during an argument.\nAnd Ferguson is hoping a change of scenery will help Morrison put his off-field problems behind him.\n\"In the case of Ravel it's been quite well documented,\" said Ferguson. \"I think he's better out of Manchester.\n\"He's got a great talent but it's how to deal with it that is important.\"\nMorrison told the Hammers website: \"I'm really pleased to have signed.

It strengthens the view held by many that football puts results on the pitch before principles, and of a profound disconnect between club boardrooms and the public at large.\n\"With its reputation for tribalism, football sadly already has a reputation for bringing out the worst in certain sections of society. The vile threats that Oldham say their staff were subject to only reinforced that view.\"\nThere is plenty of evidence to suggest it has if Sheffield United seriously thought they could offer training facilities to Evans and Oldham Athletic attempt to sign him without believing it would create a corrosive reaction in many quarters.\nSheffield United's gesture was well-intended but na\u00efve, while Oldham clearly felt they could ride against the rising tide of public opinion - to no avail.\nAnd in the modern, commercially driven world of football - perhaps even more in the Football League where every penny counts - clubs showing an interest in Evans have also misjudged the mood of sponsors.\nDr Leah Donlan, lecturer in marketing at Manchester Business School, told BBC Sport: \"Companies and brands seek to get involved in sponsoring football clubs for a variety of reasons, with three prominent ones being to enhance their image, to raise awareness and, particularly at low levels, to demonstrate a commitment to local communities.\n\"By sponsoring a football club, sponsors concede some control over their brand image to the club itself, as the way they are perceived becomes intertwined with the prevailing perceptions of the club.\n\"Based on these motivations, sponsors might threaten to withdraw their support for clubs who sign Ched Evans if they believe that the resulting image associations of the club do not fit with the way that they want their brand/company to be perceived.\"\nRehabilitation or rejection? Listen to a BBC Sportshour discussion on the contrasting cases of convicted rapists Mike Tyson and Ched Evans\nThe Football Association has admitted it was powerless to intervene in Evans' playing future.\nBut FA chairman Greg Dyke has hinted moves are now on the agenda to introduce a code of conduct or strict guidelines to be applied should similar cases arise in future in line with its review of public and private communications, as well as behaviour.\nEvans would be unable to return to certain professions as a convicted rapist and this is where it appears the FA is now preparing to tighten up its own jurisdiction.\nBBC sports editor Dan Roan says: \"Ultimately, it should be for the FA to dictate what crimes - if any - prevent a footballer from resuming their careers after serving their time. The statement by FA chairman Greg Dyke that rule changes may be forthcoming is a welcome admission that such a storm cannot be allowed to happen again.\n\"This week I saw an Oldham board director close to tears as he tried to make sense of the furore the club found itself in and the threats his staff were subject to. Never again can it be left to the clubs to make such an emotionally charged decision.\"\nSince Evans was released from prison, the PFA's stance is that it is supporting a member of its organisation who is now free to return to his employment.\nWhen Sheffield United withdrew training facilities amid a public outcry the PFA stated: \"We do not agree that society should impose different rules for footballers which go beyond the position of law.\"\nPFA chief executive Gordon Taylor has continued to be part of the supporting cast surrounding Evans - and whether it meets with public approval or not, the position adopted is one of a union backing one of its members.\nTaylor has been forced to navigate the difficult journey between supporting a PFA member's attempt to return to employment in the game, while ensuring he did not do anything to offend sections of public opinion or in any way appear to be an apologist for Evans.\nOne of the game's most experienced and high-profile administrators - he has run the PFA since 1981 - he appeared to have done this successfully until he linked the Evans case with the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.\nNo-one with any knowledge of Taylor would suggest these words were designed to cause offence. This appeared more a case of ill-judgement as opposed to malice, words for which he swiftly apologised but words that carried even more resonance as the Hillsborough inquests continue.\nIan Prior, head of sport at the Guardian and Observer, told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It betrayed, at best, a tenuous grasp of reality, not to mention good taste.\"\nBarry Devonside, who lost his son at Hillsborough, called Taylor \"foolhardy\", adding: \"He really needs to connect brain with mouth.\"\nThe return of Evans to the game and the nation's consciousness has thrust Taylor firmly into the spotlight - but it is unlikely that verbal slip will have any impact on his job at the PFA.\nWhen Sheffield United agreed to allow Evans to train with them - an offer swiftly retracted after they said reaction to the decision \"was at an intensity that could not have been anticipated\" - the Football League made its position clear in a statement. The situation remains unchanged.\nThe statement read: \"Should the Football League receive a request from any of its member clubs to register the player, we will have no option but to accept it - assuming that all other aspects of the proposed registration are in order.\n\"Ultimately the choice of whether to engage a player that has been released from a custodial sentence will be one for individual clubs who, having ensured that the player has the required permission from the probation service to work in football, will have to make their own assessment of the potential consequences for their public reputation and business affairs, as well as the relationship they have with their own supporters.\"\nThe Football League added that at a meeting of their board earlier in the season, it considered the implications for football's reputation of clubs employing players following their release from prison.\nThe board has asked its independent directors to consider the matter further before reporting back to the board at a future meeting and then the clubs at an appropriate point.\nHis career will be restricted to the United Kingdom as confirmed when a recent link to Hibernians of Malta was dismissed, not only by the club but more significantly by the Ministry Of Justice.\nThe Ministry explained that strict conditions imposed on sex offenders \"effectively rules out working abroad\".\nA spokesperson said: \"We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims.\n\"Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face-to-face meetings. This effectively rules out working abroad. The offenders will be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.\"\nEvery time he has been linked with a return to football, the reaction towards the club involved has been incendiary.\nSheffield United quickly withdrew their offer to allow Evans to train, Hartlepool hastily backed away from manager Ronnie Moore's suggestion he would consider a deal, and Oldham come closest to completing a transfer.\nIt is na\u00efve in the extreme to suggest clubs who have kept any potential interest secret so far would not have watched developments and taken note of the adverse reaction and publicity.\nOldham owner Simon Corney revealed three Premier League managers had been in touch to offer support, while Hull City manager Steve Bruce (one of that three) questioned the conviction of Evans and said he should be allowed to play again.\nBBC Sport contacted clubs in League One and Two for their stance on whether they would sign Evans. Including Oldham, 12 clubs in League One ruled out the possibility of signing the former Wales international, while the remaining 36 either said they did not wish to comment or did not respond at all.\nOn this evidence, and given the events at Oldham this week, it would be appear only a brave, desperate or particularly thick-skinned club would now pursue a deal for the 26-year-old.\nThe reality suggests more of the same instant acrimony that engulfed Sheffield United and Oldham.\nIt is almost impossible to see how the situation would be any different, even though he has now apologised \"for the effects\" of his actions in 2011 while continuing to maintain his innocence over his rape conviction.\nWhen the Blades considered an offer, shirt sponsors DBL Logistics threatened to end involvement with the club, while Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would want her name removed from a Bramall Lane stand should he sign. They weren't alone. More than 165,000 people signed a petition lobbying against a deal.\nOldham encountered a similar reaction, while a club director told BBC sports editor Dan Roan a staff member was informed a named relative would be raped if the deal went ahead.\nEvans himself blamed \"mob rule\" and \"the more radical elements of our society\" for placing pressure on sponsors.\nAn international striker, available on a free transfer, only 26. Perfect for most clubs in the January transfer window - unless that striker is convicted rapist Ched Evans.\nEvans started his career at Manchester City but could not break through, leaving after scoring one goal in 16 appearances, and signed for Sheffield United in a \u00a33m deal in July 2009 after a loan spell at Norwich City.\nThe promise he had shown in spells was fulfilled at Bramall Lane, where he scored 42 goals in 113 appearances - a highly respectable record. He won 13 Wales caps, scoring one goal, but fell short of the standards required in the Premier League.\nInstead, following his release from prison, his attempts to return to the game have failed amid such unrest, ill-feeling and emotion, and it is difficult to see where he will emerge next.

Both he and Ahn Cheol-soo, another candidate, have urged US President Donald Trump to cool his position against Pyongyang and spoken out against any first strike by the United States.\nHe has suggested that a new approach might be required in handling North Korea with the South taking the lead in negotiations, and has voiced concern about Thaad, the massive US missile defence system being installed in the South.\nThe MP for the city of Busan was former President Roh Moo-hyun's chief of staff - and was nicknamed \"Shadow of Roh\".\nMost recently though, he has come under fire over allegations that the government of then-President Roh consulted North Korea before abstaining from a United Nations vote on a human rights resolution against the North in 2007.\nMr Moon has denied the allegations.\nIn the 1970s, as a student activist, he led protests against President Park Chung-hee - Park Geun-hye's father - for which he was imprisoned.\nA former medical doctor turned software tycoon Ahn Cheol-so, 55, was long seen as the only serious contender to the frontrunner, constantly polling in second place.\nLatest opinion polls though see him tied at just under 20% with conservative Hong Joon-pyo.\nMr Ahn also ran for the job in 2012 but dropped out to endorse Mr Moon and consolidate votes against Park Geun-hye - who went on to win.\nHe is a member of the National Assembly and co-founded the opposition People's Party but resigned from the chairmanship in June over the party's alleged involvement in a kickback scandal.\nAs a potential candidate for the 2017 presidential election, he has also been compared to Bernie Sanders for his recommended reforms to education, welfare and economics.\nHe has said he would strengthen laws to punish white collar criminals, limit pardons for corporate criminals guilty of corruption and bring about more regulations in order to curb the influence of the powerful chaebols (family-run conglomerates).\nMr Ahn said he would seek to restart six-party talks aimed at denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\nHong Joon-pyo, 62, is the head of the Liberty Korea Party, one of the two factions to have emerged after the collapse of the conservative party in the wake of the Park scandal.\nThe Liberty Korea Party is the one loyal to Ms Park.\nRecent polls have shown a last minute surge for Mr Hong, level with Ahn Cheol-so. Both are, however, more than 20% behind the front-runner.\nMr Hong has come particularly under fire for his apparent involvement in an attempted rape case. Mr Hong wrote in an essay in 2005 that he provided an aphrodisiac powder to a friend who wanted to rape a fellow student at Seoul's Korea University.\nHe has repeatedly apologised over the case,

resolution in November 1994 to try the ringleaders of the genocide.\nTen accused were acquitted while 32 convicts are serving sentences, it says.\nIt is due to close in 2014 after it has finalised 16

defended its record, saying that genocide trials at international tribunals are extremely complicated affairs.\nHe told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that witnesses were scattered around the world and the court used three languages.\n\"The ICTR has shown to the whole world that impunity will no longer be tolerated,\" he said.", "summary": "A UN war crimes court has sentenced a key

The value is in creating a network - or what the Scottish entrepreneur likes to call \"the ultimate tech eco-system\".\nThis brings early stage technology firms into one space, where they can spark off each other.\nOnce there, he provides a service more than a space, intended \"to remove friction - just keeping everything out of the way which isn't core to their business.\n\"A lot of that would be introductions to lawyers or accountants or real estate people, or capital or corporations.\"\nThink of it as an office water-cooler, with something special in the water.

Half the income comes from the access fees they're charged.\nFrom the perspective of the young technology company, Duncan Logan explains that an Initial Public Offering - or a stock market float - has become more difficult, or at least less attractive.\nTo scale up the company and to give it reach, 40% of new funding comes from big corporates. And being sold to a big investor is the path taken by around 90% of graduates from Rocket Space.\nSo while renting out office space sounds like the less lucrative or glamorous end of Silicon Valley, this company's reputation has this month secured a $336m (\u00c2\u00a3257m) investment from Chinese firm HNA Group.\nThat still leaves the 44-year old founder with most of the equity in Rocket Space, while providing him with the capital he needs to build a similar centre in London and another in China.\n\"It is all about quality, and as soon as we drop that quality bar, the whole concept sort of falls away,\" says Logan.\n\"The very best entrepreneurs and the very best start-ups want to hang out with the other top quality people.

But he observes that the successful ones tend to have ideas that look ridiculous at the start.\nThat way, others are not attracted in to that market space and they have the time and space to grow to unicorn maturity.\nThe downside, as Logan found with a previous tech venture that failed, is that no-one in Silicon Valley wanted to tell him that his idea was not going to work. No-one wanted to be the one who rubbished a subsequent success.\nThe successful companies are very focussed on culture, he adds.\n\"They have an incredible focus from day one on the quality of the talent that they bring in. They are probably the most ruthless at people putting applicants through interviews.\n\"Then, there's operational excellence. It is all very well having a fantastic product or service, but a lot of start-ups die because they can't keep up with the growth that they see in the marketplace.\"\nThe new finance and the Chinese investors will help open up opportunities for Rocket Space in China, where Logan wants to open a tech centre, and where he wants to draw on the investing eco-system to benefit his US clients.\nHe also plans to open a London office in 2017.  And while he has no plans, yet, to extend that to his native Scotland, he is impressed by the growth of unicorns such as Skyscanner.\nIn any case, Edinburgh now has a privately-run business, CodeBase, which aspires to provide a similar platform for its tech business tenants.\nThe experience of growing a big tech success spins out people to build new companies. The key is to find people who aren't content to sit back and enjoy the enormous wealth they have created, but who want to dive back in and re-invest in new companies.\nWith an agriculture degree from Aberdeen University, Duncan Logan had to leave Scotland in his 20s to achieve his ambitions.\nBut he reckons that might not be necessary for a tech entrepreneur now.

It was a big moment for the club because an awful lot of work had been done to get to that stage.\n\"To see the ground full for a Test match and a one-day international match [both against Australia] is what a lot of people have worked hard towards.

The Brotherhood described the action - which brought international condemnation - as \"a massacre\".\nIn December, the interim Egyptian government declared the group a \"terrorist organisation\", blaming it for a string of attacks, which the Brotherhood denied.\nThe movement is the country's oldest and largest Islamist organisation, meaning its ideology is based on the teachings of the Koran.\nFounded by Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood - or al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun in Arabic - has influenced Islamist movements around the world with its model of political activism combined with Islamic charity work.\nThe movement initially aimed simply to spread Islamic morals and good works, but soon became involved in politics, particularly the fight to rid Egypt of British colonial control and cleanse it of all Western influence.\nWhile the Ikhwan say that they support democratic principles, one of the group's stated aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or Sharia. Its most famous slogan, used worldwide, is: \"Islam is the solution.\"\nAfter Banna launched the Muslim Brotherhood in 1928, branches were set up throughout the country - each running a mosque, a school and a sporting club - and its membership grew rapidly.\nBy the late 1940s, the group is estimated to have had 500,000 members in Egypt, and its ideas had spread across the Arab world.\nAt the same time, Banna created a paramilitary wing, the Special Apparatus, whose operatives joined the fight against British rule and engaged in a campaign of bombings and assassinations.\nThe Egyptian government dissolved the group in late 1948 for attacking British and Jewish interests. Soon afterwards, the group was accused of assassinating Prime Minister Mahmoud al-Nuqrashi.\nBanna denounced the killing, but he was subsequently shot dead by an unknown gunman - believed to have been a member of the security forces.\nIn 1952, colonial rule came to an end following a military coup d'etat led by a group of young officers calling themselves the Free Officers.\nThe Ikhwan played a supporting role - Anwar al-Sadat, who became president in 1970, was once the Free Officers' liaison with them - and initially co-operated with the new government, but relations soon soured.\nEgyptian Brotherhood: Who's who\nAfter a failed attempt to assassinate President Gamal Abdul Nasser in 1954, the Ikhwan were blamed, banned, and thousands of members imprisoned and tortured. The group continued, however, to grow underground.\nThis clash with the authorities prompted an important shift in the ideology of the Ikhwan, evident in the writing of one prominent member, Sayyid Qutb.\nQutb's work advocated the use of jihad (struggle) against jahili (ignorant) societies, both Western and so-called Islamic ones, which he argued were in need of radical transformation.\nHis writings - particularly the 1964 work Milestones - inspired the founders of many radical Islamist groups, including Islamic Jihad and al-Qaeda.\nIn 1965, the government again cracked down on the Ikhwan, executing Qutb in 1966 and transforming him into a martyr for many people across the region.\nDuring the 1980s, the Ikhwan attempted to rejoin the political mainstream.\nSuccessive leaders formed alliances with the Wafd party in 1984, and with the Socialist Labour Party and the Socialist Liberals Party in 1987, becoming the main opposition force in Egypt. In 2000, the Ikhwan won 17 seats in the lower house of parliament, the People's Assembly.\nFive years later, the group achieved its best election result up to then, with independent candidates allied to it winning 20% of the seats.\nThe result shocked President Hosni Mubarak. The government subsequently launched a crackdown on the Ikhwan, detaining hundreds of members, and instituted a number of legal \"reforms\" to counter their resurgence.\nThe constitution was rewritten to stipulate that \"political activity or political parties shall not be based on any religious background or foundation\"; independent candidates were banned from running for president; and anti-terrorism legislation that gave the security forces sweeping powers to detain suspects and restrict public gatherings was introduced.\nAt the beginning of 2011, anti-government demonstrations, apparently encouraged by the Tunisian street protests which prompted the sudden departure of Tunisia's President Ben Ali, kicked off across the country.\nThough many members of the Ikhwan joined the protests, they maintained a low profile. The group's traditional slogans were not seen in Cairo's Tahrir Square.\nBut as the protests grew and the government began to offer concessions, including a promise by Mr Mubarak not to seek re-election in September 2011, Egypt's largest opposition force took a more assertive role.\nIn the first parliamentary elections after Mr Mubarak's overthrow in February 2011, the Ikhwan's newly formed Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) won nearly half the seats in the People's Assembly, eclipsing the earlier performances of independents allied to the movement.\nThe ultraconservative Salafist Nour party came second, meaning that Islamists controlled 70% of the seats in the lower house. There was a similar outcome from elections for the upper house, the Shura Council.\nThis allowed the Ikhwan and their allies to control the selection of candidates for the 100-member constituent assembly tasked with drafting Egypt's new constitution, prompting criticism from liberals, secularists, Coptic Christians, young people and women, who complained that the panel did not reflect the diversity of Egyptian society.\nConcerns that the Ikhwan might be seeking to monopolise power were heightened when they announced they would field a candidate in the presidential election, despite having previously promised they would not.\nIn 2012, the FJP's then chairman, Mohammed Morsi, became Egypt's first democratically elected president. He won 51% of the vote in a deeply polarising run-off against retired air force commander Ahmed Shafiq.\nMr Morsi sought to reassure opponents of the Ikhwan by insisting that as president he wanted to build a \"democratic, civil and modern state\" that guaranteed the freedom of religion and right to peaceful protest.\nSignificant public opposition to Mr Morsi and the Ikhwan began building in November 2012.\nWishing to ensure that the constituent assembly could finish drafting the new constitution, the president issued an interim constitutional declaration granting himself far-reaching powers. He agreed to limit the scope of the declaration after days of opposition protests, but there was further outrage at the end of that month when the constituent assembly approved a rushed version of the constitution - despite a boycott by liberals, secularists and the Coptic Church, who said it failed to protect freedom of expression and religion.\nAs opposition mounted, President Morsi issued a decree authorising the armed forces to protect national institutions and polling places until a referendum on the draft constitution was held in December 2012, which critics said amounted to a form of martial law.\nThe army returned to barracks after the charter was approved, but within weeks it was forced to deploy in cities along the Suez Canal to halt deadly clashes between opponents and supporters of Mr Morsi and the Ikhwan. At the end of January 2013, the military warned that the political crisis might \"lead to a collapse of the state\".\nIn late April, opposition activists set up the grassroots Tamarod (Rebel) protest movement. It focused on collecting signatures for a petition, which complained about Mr Morsi's failure to restore security and fix the economy, and accused him of putting the Brotherhood's interests ahead of the country's as a whole. Tamarod also organised mass protests to mark the first anniversary of the day Mr Morsi took office. On 30 June 2013, millions of people took to the streets to demand his resignation.\nThe unrest and rising death toll prompted the military to warn Mr Morsi on 1 July that it would intervene and impose its own \"roadmap\" if he did not satisfy the public's demands within 48 hours and end the political crisis.\nOn 3 July, the military deployed troops and armoured vehicles in the streets. It declared that the constitution had been suspended and the chief justice of the SCC would assume presidential powers, overthrowing Mr Morsi.\nThe Ikhwan denounced the \"military coup against the elected president and the will of the nation\", and vowed that they would refuse to deal with Egypt's interim leaders.\nBrotherhood supporters set up protest camps in Nahda Square and near the Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque and refused to disband them, despite repeated calls by the interim government.\nAfter weeks of deadlock, hopes rose that the protests would remain peaceful.

It's unusual because the Earth, Sun and the Moon all have to align.\nIt also rare because of the elliptical (oval) shape of the Moon's path, or orbit, around the Earth, meaning the Moon is sometimes further away from us.\nAdditionally the Moon's orbit is on a tilt, making it even more rare when the Sun, Moon and Earth align.\nWe haven't had a full solar eclipse since 1999 and the one happening this March is only a partial eclipse.\nIf you miss this one, it will be 2026 before you can catch the next partial eclipse.\nIt will be 2090 until the next total solar eclipse is seen in the UK.\nAs it's such an unusual occurrence, it's probably worth having a party.\nIt's going to be a breakfast affair as the eclipse begins in the UK at 8.45am.\nThe maximum eclipse, when the Moon is nearest the middle of the Sun, will be at 9.31am.\nIt will all wind down at 10.41am.\nThe further north you go, the greater the shadow over the Sun and the fuller the eclipse.\nUp to 94% of the Sun's light will be blocked by the Moon in Scotland.\nIn places further south like London, the Sun will probably only be 85% obscured by the Moon.\nAccording to Dr Edward Bloomer, an astronomer with the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, the Faroe Islands is the best place to see it.\nBut if you can't make it that far north, you'll still get a \"very good view indeed\" in the UK.\nAll you need is a \"nice clear horizon and view of the sky\".\nIt's about not having tall buildings or trees blocking the view.\nEclipse glasses: Looking at the Sun directly damages your eyes.\nThese special specs are specially made to filter out harmful radiation and ultra violet light so you can gaze at the star without hurting your vision.\nThey are relatively cheap and you can buy them online.\nAlternatively Dr Bloomer says you can make your own eclipse viewer at home with a \"pinhole projection\".\nHe told Newsbeat: \"Get yourself a piece of card and cut a hole in it.\n\"Cover that with a piece of tinfoil, pierce a very small hole in it.\n\"If you point that towards the Sun and project the light coming through the pinhole onto a piece of white cardboard or paper then you can view the Sun and view the Sun's projection there, so you aren't looking directly at the Sun.\"\nIt's not just the fact that you get to see the \"celestial mechanics at work\" which makes eclipses interesting, according to Dr Bloomer.\nYou can see the atmosphere of the Sun, called the corona (yup, like the beer) during the eclipse.\nThis corona is super-hot, 100 times hotter than the already impressive 5,538C temperature of the sun itself.\nEclipses reveal aspects of the corona, such as streamers, (long bright pointy bits packed full of electrons) plumes (thin streaks from the Sun's north and south pole), and loops (shimmering active magnetic fields, often found above darker sun spots.)\nIf you're staring at the sky but feeling underwhelmed, indulge your fellow party-goers with some of these eclipse-related facts to get the party started.\n1.

In Romanian folklore V\u00c3\u00a2rcolacs are wolf-demons that eat the moon and the sun during eclipses. They are often classed as vampire-hybrids.\nGreek mythology borrows this notion for their 'vrykolakas'. However, these undead creatures drink blood and swell up like drums.\nKorean folklore also links dogs with eclipses, saying that solar eclipses occur because mythical dogs are trying to steal the sun.\n3. Muslims conduct special prayers during the eclipse. In them they thank Allah for his control over the Sun and the Moon.\n4. There's a recurring myth that pregnant women can't go outside during an eclipse. Astronomers from the Griffith Observatory in LA say they get dozens of calls about it when an eclipse happens, even though it seems irrational. But if one of your friends is pregnant, don't worry, you can invite them along to your party. This myth has no basis in fact.\n5.

The director of the budget office has been sacked.\nAnd thanks to this tale of bloated figures and discrepancies, President Buhari now knows that his famous war on corruption must extend beyond big names and past governments.\nThe looters are within his camp as well as without.\nMore from Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani:", "summary": "In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the trouble Nigeria is having balancing the books.", "id": "35633551"}, {"document": "Cairns, 45, has denied charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the trial at Southwark Crown Court in London.\nCairns is accused of falsely declaring under oath in a libel case in 2012 that he had never cheated at cricket.\nHe is also accused of perverting the course of justice by inducing a fellow cricketer to give a false statement.\nIn the 2012 libel case - England's first Twitter libel trial - Cairns won damages of $130,000 (\u00c2\u00a390,000) by successfully suing Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi over a tweet in January 2010 which accused the cricketer of match-fixing while playing for the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League in 2008.\nThe prosecution at his current trial argued that Cairns lied when he promised during the earlier trial that he had never cheated.\nDuring his trial Cairns has repeatedly denied allegations that he tried to coerce former teammates into fixing matches.\nCairns is also accused of perverting the course of justice by inducing fellow cricketer Lou Vincent to give a false witness statement in a Skype call.\nLou Vincent told the court that Cairns had approached him suggesting he deliberately play badly for the Chandigarh Lions and said he helped fix matches under \"direct orders\" from Cairns while playing for the Lions.

MK boss Karl Robinson, a proud Liverpool fan, has admitted he cried after watching Lawrie Sanchez score the goal that handed the trophy to the Crazy Gang.\nBut, while both sets of supporters rose to the challenge at Stadium MK, the early action failed to match the build-up.\nThe most eye-catching moment in the first 30 minutes was above the pitch when a plane, chartered by AFC supporters, flew over tugging a banner reading \"We are Wimbledon\".\nAngelo Balanta's shot wide of the post was all MK had to show for their dominance in possession.\nIt was no surprise when the League One side went ahead but the nature of the goal was out of keeping with the game up to that point. Gleeson's stunning 25-yard effort flew into the top-right corner and put the hosts ahead on the stroke of half-time.\nMK would have expected an instant reaction from AFC after the break but could have been out of sight themselves, with Sullivan, who played 224 times for the old Wimbledon, getting a hand to Ryan Lowe's close-range effort and Dean Bowditch shooting into the side netting with the goal gaping.\nFormer Wimbledon player and manager Dave Bassett:\n\"When Wimbledon scored their goal you would have expected MK to change but they were slow and predictable. They were going backward and sideways with their passes too often. They didn't do anything quicker and it looked like Wimbledon would get their draw, in fact Wimbledon had a great chance to win the game. But that is Cup football.\"\nThe AFC response came from a rare burst forward when Toby Ajala's cross was nodded in tidily by Midson.\nHis celebrations were accompanied by a crowd of AFC supporters who had streamed on to the pitch, letting 10 years of emotion get the better of them in unsavoury scenes that were quickly calmed by stewards.\nIt was a series of events that raised the atmosphere in the ground from tense to boisterous and both sides reacted, feeling the urgency and the desire of their supporters to claim a memorable victory.\nRyan Lowe thought he had done just that for Robinson's side but his celebrations were cut short by an offside flag against Zeli Ismail, who had laid on the chance for the striker.\nThe League Two side then had a great chance of their own but Steven Gregory was unable to beat David Martin, another former Wimbledon keeper, when one-on-one having capitalised on Darren Potter's mistake.\nAnd, just when it looked like a replay and a quickfire second encounter was on the cards, MK stole it in the dying minutes.\nAFC failed to fully clear an MK corner, Ismail struck a shot into the ground that Otsemobor flicked his leg against and turned to see the ball loop over a helpless Sullivan.\nA few MK supporters failed to resist the urge to celebrate on the pitch, but, when order was restored, Robinson's side managed to stand strong against a late onslaught to treasure a satisfying win and leave their opponents desolate.\nMK Dons manager Karl Robinson said:\n\"It's been a tough week. It's been enjoyable but it's also been difficult.\n\"I thought the game typified two sets of teams with great hunger and passion for the club they play for. Two teams can walk away from this stadium very proud of each other.\n\"I wanted this game to go smoothly, I wanted it to be conducted in a manner that was right for the English game and I thought we all did that.\n\"Maybe I got a bit excited with the goal at the end but I'm not going to apologise for that.\n\"I love this club and the players who wear our shirt. I'm sure you'd rather see me celebrating like a lunatic than just stood there with a stone-face smile.\"\nAFC Wimbledon manager Neal Ardley said:\n\"I've got mainly pride. Pride for the players. We worked hard on a game plan and we felt it was the best way we could cause an upset. Every single player to a man carried those instructions out.\n\"They got a great first goal and a bizarre second. But we were inches from going in front so we can't ask any more than that.\n\"My main fear was not doing the fans proud and I can sit here now, despite hurting from the defeat, and say we did that.\n\"We knew we would end up having very little possession. We knew we couldn't press them high up the pitch because they play between the lines very well.\n\"The game plan went to a tee but we were hoping for that stroke of luck and perhaps that wasn't with us.\"\nFull Time   The referee ends the match.\nSubstitution      Mathias Doumbe on for Luke Chadwick.\nGoal!  - Jon Otsemobor -    MK Dons 2 - 1 Wimbledon        Goal scored by Jon Otsemobor from inside the penalty box to the top right corner of the goal.

historical evidence of problems between Welsh and English supporters and most of the interaction around the match would be \"friendly banter\".\nHe said: \"The UK football intelligence system is one of the best in Europe and where the English and Welsh officers will be helping is by advising that if French officers are not comfortable with fans' behaviour, early intervention and talking to supporters works best.\n\"They will be gauging the mood and trying to see that boisterous singing isn't read as a threat so the French police don't make an inappropriate or heavy-handed response.\n\"The problem is if the French riot police use tear gas indiscriminately as happened in Marseille, you create the opposite effect.\n\"You don't want a riot with everybody against police -

The widespread use of festival fireworks, the burning of rubbish by the city's poor, plus farm waste from around the city, vehicular emissions and construction dust, all contribute to the city's thick \"pea-soup\" fogs.\nThings get worse in winter: last month, schools were shut, construction and demolition work suspended, people wore face masks and were asked to work from home.\nThe move came after levels of PM2.5 - tiny particles that can affect the lungs - soared to over 90 times the level considered safe by the World Health Organization and 15 times the federal government's norms.\nCarrying out the jet engine experiment outside a coal-fired electricity plant makes sense as coal accounts for more than 60% of India's power generation. In two years, the country could surpass China as the biggest importer of thermal coal.\nCoal-fired energy may be linked to more than 100,000 premature deaths and millions of cases of asthma and respiratory ailments. Also, emissions from a 1,000-megawatt coal-fired plant are equivalent to emissions from roughly 500,000 cars.\nScientists say that jet engines were used in the Soviet Union 45 years ago to enhance rainfall.\n\"They achieved some success,\" says Dr Alamaro. \"As far as I know nobody tried using jet engines for smog mitigation.\"\nFarmers have also rented helicopters to hover over their fields to \"agitate and disrupt the inversions\" to protect their crops.\nNext month, Dr Alamaro will join some of India's top scientists and collaborators from government agencies at a workshop to plan the experiment.\nThere are concerns: noise from the jet engine, for example.\n\"In the beginning,\" he says, \"the jet engine will be tested in remote location and not necessarily near a power plant, to observe the jet properties and for optimisation.\"\nThe scientists say that fears about emissions from jet engines fouling the air are unfounded as their emissions \"are much cleaner than that of the power plant per unit of power\".\nThere are reportedly offers of retired jet engines from air forces in India and the US for the experiment.\nScientists are talking to Tata Group, a private power producer, to use one of their plants for a site for the experiment.\nBefore the test, meteorological data on the area, along with information on frequency of smog will be essential. Drones will be used before and after the experiment.\nCritics of the planned experiment doubt whether the jet exhausts will be powerful enough to create a virtual chimney and blow out the smog, and question whether expensive jet engines can be used on a large scale to control air pollution in a vast city such as Delhi.\nBut Dr Alamaro is optimistic.\n\"Each new technology should start with the least resistant path for success,\" he says.\n\"The concentration of emission from coal is very high near the power plant.\n\"So a jet engine that elevates this emission is more effective near the power plant than somewhere else in the city that is plagued by smog.\n\"That said, we also plan to try to elevate the less concentrated smog in and around the city by jet systems.\n\"For example, the jet system can be placed near highways where vehicle emission is high, so the jet is more effective than somewhere else in the city.\"\nIf successful, Dr Alamaro says, this method can be used \"anywhere and anytime, away from a power plant and during normal atmospheric conditions\" to control air pollution.\nFairly soon, we may know if jet engines can really help to clean Delhi's foul air.", "summary": "Sometime next year, if all goes well, a retired jet engine will be mounted on a flatbed trailer and taken to a coal-fired power plant in Delhi.", "id": "38285567"}, {"document": "In a Scrubbing Up column for the BBC News, Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, says the hundreds of millions of pounds it will cost could be better spent elsewhere.\nHe said other areas for investment include improving out-of-hospital services and tackling sepsis.\nBut Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC doctors agreed with him.\nHis claims come despite criticism from the British Medical Association, which has argued he has not given enough detail about the plans or explained how it will be funded.\nThe BMA has been given until next Friday to agree to discuss the plans with the government.\nPlans for a seven-day NHS have provoked a bitter row between the government and doctors' representatives.\nMinisters argue thousands of people die every year because there is not the same level of service at weekends as during the week.\nThe British Medical Association, which represents doctors, says the government has failed to set out what its policy means in practice, and what it will cost.\nIt points out that many doctors already work at weekends.\nIn an exclusive interview and article for the BBC's \"Scrubbing Up\" column, the Nuffield Trusts's chief executive, Nigel Edwards, says a seven-day NHS is a good aspiration.\nBut he argues the health service is in a world of \"tough trade-offs\", with many hospitals only managing to meet their current commitments by running up deficits.\nHe concludes the policy is likely to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and suggests - in the current climate - there are better ways of spending the money.\nIn his column, he says: \"NHS policy is largely made by middle-aged, middle-class men and women who commute long distances into London and Leeds.\"\nMr Edwards added: \"I think one compelling priority would be to try and shorten the time that patients stay in hospital.\n\"A seven-day-service helps a little with that but actually this is more about investing in community services and getting the decision-processes in hospitals a lot slicker.

This seems to have been largely overlooked in the gushing praise being heaped on the president for both talking tough and acting tough when it comes to Syria.\nOne hashtag doing the rounds on social media even reads \"We love you Trump\".\nWhat people admire is what they see as his willingness to act on his convictions, in contrast to how Mr Obama was perceived by many in the region - perhaps unfairly - as weak, indecisive and not really interested in the Middle East.\nBehind the scenes and in the corridors of power in several Arab capitals, there is enormous relief that a new team is in the White House.\nOn his recent visit to Washington, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi was given a red carpet welcome, effusive praise from Mr Trump and little mention made of the mounting human rights abuses being committed by his government in the name of national security.\nIn Yemen, the Obama administration was so appalled by the civilian casualties caused by faulty targeting from Saudi-led air strikes that it rowed back on US military support for Riyadh's coalition battling the rebel Houthi movement.\nThe Trump administration has reversed this.\nIn Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, two countries about whose human rights record the Obama administration had concerns, the White House has strengthened ties.\nEarlier this year, President Trump's newly appointed CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, was given a warm welcome in both countries' capitals.\nAnd on Iran, where Egyptian, Jordanian and Gulf Arab rulers all feared that the Obama administration was turning a blind eye to what they saw as Iranian expansionism for the sake of the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the Trump administration has reassured them with its hostile rhetoric towards Tehran.\nBut approval for President Trump is far from universal.\nWriting in Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National in February, the president of the Arab American Institute, James Zogby, complained of what he called \"ham-fisted anti-Muslim rhetoric and policies that have caused [IS], al-Qaeda and the Iranian leader to thank him\".\nWhat the Arab world wanted, he wrote, was a relationship with a US partner who would work with them to ensure regional stability.\nMr Alani told the BBC that while President Trump was certainly riding high on the back of the recent US missile strike on a Syrian air force base, there was still huge uncertainty in the region about his future intentions and what he expected from Arab leaders in return for US support.\n\"What will he demand from us in return? Will it be money? Will it be physical participation in military or other operations?\" he asked.\n\"We can agree [with Washington] on joint aims for the region, but we may still have differences on how to get there.\"", "summary": "They're calling him \"Abu Ivanka al-Amriki\" - \"Father of Ivanka, the American\".", "id": "39581911"}, {"document": "Jake Taylor and Lee Holmes went close for Exeter early on before Taylor was set-up by young striker Ollie Watkins for his second goal in three games.\nExeter's Bobby Olejnik saved well from Liam McAlinden soon after the break while Shamir Fenelon and Sonny Bradley were also denied by the Austrian.\nBut Watkins got his fourth goal in six games to seal the win late on.\nThe 20-year-old powerfully headed in Taylor's cross as Exeter moved up to 11th place - five points off the play-offs - while Crawley stay 16th.\nCrawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"I think they showed what a good side they were, particularly in the first half, and we didn't set out not to make tackles or not to stay with runners.\n\"But I felt the goal was coming, as did the crowd by the sounds of it, we didn't take enough warning from it and we didn't stay with our men properly.\n\"We watched them and without Matt Harrold in the team we just felt we needed to be a little more solid in the middle of the park.

They were 1-0 down at Napoli at half-time in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie having been outplayed in the opening period and knowing that conceding again would send them out.\nZidane took decisive action, abandoning his preferred 4-3-3 formation and reverting to a 4-4-2, pushing Bale back into a deeper position on the right of midfield.\nThe intention was to put an extra body in midfield and deny Napoli the space they had been finding so easily - and it worked. A header from Sergio Ramos put Real back in control of the tie and they ended up 3-1 winners on the night, progressing easily.\nThat game in Italy was not the first time Zidane had veered away from 4-3-3 - he had regularly experimented with several shapes - but it was perhaps a turning point because he has rarely returned to it since.\nAt first, Bale was able to keep his place in the team as a winger in a fairly conventional 4-4-2, but that approach wasn't satisfactory because it meant Luka Modric or Toni Kroos playing out position on the other flank.\nAnd during Bale's recent absence, Zidane has made another tweak by introducing a narrow midfield diamond, with defensive-minded Casemiro at the base, Modric and Kroos on either side and Isco at the tip.\nIt has worked extremely well. The midfield quartet have exerted far more control over possession, Isco has pushed forward to support Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, and full-backs Dani Carvajal and Marcelo have still provided plenty of width.\nAlthough it is too early to tell whether Zidane has decided to abandon 4-3-3 for good, Real have played their most convincing football under his management with the 4-4-2 diamond - a formation it is difficult to see Bale fitting into easily.\nWhile Bale may struggle to adapt to the new system, it has been tailor-made for Isco to finally start to fulfil his undoubted potential. The Spain international and Ronaldo have been Real's best players for the past few weeks.\nIsco's technical ability, graceful style and good-humoured personality have always made him extremely popular with Real fans, who can be heard singing the 25-year-old's name far more regularly than Bale's.\nNow there's overwhelming support for the opinion that he should start ahead of the Welshman - not just this weekend, but for good.\nAn article in Marca claimed it would be \"the greatest injustice in memory\" if Isco wasn't picked on Saturday, while a piece in El Pais underlined the Spaniard's greater suitability for the congested spaces of a midfield diamond - with the headline 'Footballer Isco; player Bale'.\nPerhaps of even greater concern for Bale is that he is not even guaranteed to be the first option from the bench.\nZidane is blessed with an extraordinary depth and variety of talent in the attacking midfield and forward departments, with Marco Asensio, James Rodriguez, Alvaro Morata and Lucas Vazquez also pushing hard for more minutes after impressive seasons.\nIn the long term, the rise of Asensio could be the biggest threat to Bale's status. The 21-year-old winger is regarded as one of Spain's hottest rising stars, and he was personally recommended to the club by national hero and fellow Mallorcan Rafael Nadal, the 14-time Grand Slam-winning tennis player.\nAsensio showed his game-changing abilities with a superb solo goal in the quarter-final victory over Bayern Munich, and from now on he will get more than the 12 starts he has been granted this season.\nAs they play in the same position, it is easy to envisage his extra playing time coming at Bale's expense.\nBale's recent absence was not his first and there is a strong sense frustration is growing over the frequency of his injuries.\nSince arriving in Spain four years ago, Bale has had 16 spells on the sidelines and Alfredo Relano, editor of newspaper AS, is one who thinks the Wales international's fitness problems have let the team evolve without him.\n\"He has lost a lot of games with injuries and in the meantime new and very good players have emerged,\" Relano told BBC Sport.\n\"I think some of the club's confidence in him is declining. Florentino Perez signed him with the idea he would compete with Neymar for future Ballon d'Or awards, but we're already starting to see that's not going to happen.\"\nIf that's true, it would be a significant development. Bale has always been perceived as one of club president Perez's favourites, with former manager Carlo Ancelotti revealing in his recent book that one of the turning points in his relationship with Real came when Perez personally asked him to change Bale's playing position.\nHowever, Bale's injuries, the rise of Isco and Asensio and the impression that he doesn't fit into Zidane's new tactical formula, could force Perez into a rethink and make the player expendable rather than a guaranteed starter for the first time.\nRelano believes that could even happen this summer, adding: \"The club wants to sign Kylian Mbappe from Monaco and there are good offers for Bale from England. It wouldn't surprise me if he left.\"\nTo put all the above into context, it must be remembered that, even in the fickle world of football, life at Real Madrid lurches rapidly from one extreme to the other like nowhere else.\nIt is only a few weeks, for example, since current flavour of the month Isco was reportedly on the verge of leaving.\nBale offers qualities nobody else at the club possesses. He is arguably the squad's best crosser, ranks alongside Ronaldo in his ability to attack balls into the middle and nobody can match his pace and power on the counter-attack.\nZidane is a strong advocate of an extreme rotation policy, consistently using all the players at his disposal rather than repeating the same starting XI. So even if Bale is no longer untouchable, he can still have a big role.\nBale, to his credit, has made it clear he will fully understand if Zidane leaves him out of the team on Saturday, refusing to put his coach under public pressure to pick him.\nAmid all the negative talk, perhaps the most accurate assessment came from Jose Felix Diaz in Marca. He argued that Bale's return from injury is a solution rather than a problem and gives Zidane an extra \"card up his sleeve\".\nBale probably won't start against Juventus, but that does not necessarily mean his Bernabeu career is over.", "summary": "Real Madrid are playing in the Champions League final in Cardiff on Saturday - but Gareth Bale looks set to miss out against Juventus in his home city.", "id": "40105284"}, {"document": "The face of the so-called Beachy Head Lady was recreated using craniofacial reconstruction.\nEastbourne Borough Council's museum service was awarded a grant of \u00c2\u00a372,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund for the Eastbourne Ancestors project.\nThe aim was to identify the gender and age of each skeleton in its collection.\nDetailed scientific analysis of more than 300 skeletons of people who lived in the south of England thousands of years ago has undertaken by scientists and archaeologists.\nTesting of the bones and teeth has identified the national or regional origins, age, gender, state of health, diet, and in some cases, how they died.\nMost of the skeletons are Anglo-Saxon, from about 1,500 years ago, but some are Neolithic and more than 4,000 years old.\nThe Beachy Head Lady was discovered in the East Sussex beauty spot in 1953, and she is thought to have lived around AD245.\nJo Seaman, heritage officer at Eastbourne Borough Council, said: \"This is a fantastic discovery for the south coast.\n\"We know this lady was around 30 years old, grew up in the vicinity of what is now East Sussex, ate a good diet of fish and vegetables, her bones were without disease and her teeth were in good condition.\"\nThe Beachy Head Lady forms part of an exhibition at the Eastbourne Museum which is opens on 1 February at the Pavilion.", "summary": "An exhibition exploring the origins of ancient skeletons in Sussex, including a woman from sub-Saharan Africa buried in Roman times, has opened.", "id": "25962183"}, {"document": "And members of the public are being invited to join the audience.\nIn the spotlight will be the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon; Labour's Kezia Dugdale; Conservative Ruth Davidson; the Lib Dem's Willie Rennie and Patrick Harvie of the Greens.\nThe debate will take place at Hopetoun House, South Queensferry, and will be chaired by the BBC's Sarah Smith.\nPotential audience members need to be available from 18:30 to 21:00.\nVoters go to the polls on 5 May to elect their new constituency and regional MSPs.

It's something that I'll be looking to do this time again and hopefully perform as well as I did the last time.\n\"My first few initial games for Scotland [Under-21s] were difficult.

There is no single solution. And there is no pain-free solution.\n\"If we spend our time trying to say: 'Can we find the one thing that will deal with the past?', I don't think we will find that one thing,\" Professor Brandon Hamber told BBC One's The View programme.\nProf Hamber is originally from South Africa and now works for the University of Ulster's International Conflict and Research Institute.\nHe spoke to The View as the fall-out continued from the attorney general's suggestion that, perhaps, it is time to halt all investigations and prosecutions of Troubles-related offences since 1998.\nAlthough there has been only a handful of prosecutions since the Good Friday Agreement, John Larkin's comments have caused great controversy, particularly among victims seeking justice, as well as truth.\nWhile Mr Larkin did not use the word amnesty, that could be the practical effect of such a new law.\nProf Hamber said Mr Larkin's comments cannot be ignored, particularly in the context of unresolved cases from the Troubles.\n\"One does have to consider the challenge that for some victims they are going to die before they get justice,\" he said. \"(That) does need to be talked about. What he is raising needs to be talked about.\"\nMr Larkin went further than the recommendations from the 2009 Eames-Bradley report on dealing with the past.\nThose recommendations were over-shadowed by rows about money for victims, rows about who is really a victim, and the competence of a legacy commission.\nThat commission would have  ended the piece-meal approach to the past, by providing a one-stop alternative to public inquiries.\nThe body, it was suggested, could probe unsolved cases, get information and still allow for the possibility of justice once the evidence had been gathered.\nFive years on, Dennis Bradley who co-authored the report is clearly frustrated. He said if the nettle had been grasped then, Northern Ireland would have been further ahead today.\nMr Bradley said, instead, the past remains as a \"cancer\" in society and politics.\nHe pointed to on-going divisions over who was to blame for the Troubles and what the truth actually is about the past.\n\"It's cancerous because one group of us want the truth and want to know the British government were as bad as the IRA - that they did illegal things,\" he said.\n\"And other people want to know that the IRA were real baddies in this and, by the way, the UVF weren't good either. So we fight around those issues and we have fought about those issues constantly.\n\"Now, if we can get past that. both at an individual and community level, we can then get on with things.\"\nHe said the problem is that politicians still want to solve it in a way that suits their constituency.\n\"You can't do that. You can only solve this if you solve it for everybody,\" he said.\nMr Bradley expressed deep regret that the Eames-Bradley report was not implemented.\n\"(We) would have been finished now,\" he said. \"We would have moved towards this famous amnesty we are talking about and people are now beginning to point up.\"\nPatrick Corrigan, of Amnesty International, said truth, justice and acknowledgement to victims were the key to society moving on.\nMr Corrigan said his organisation was opposed to a blanket amnesty on human rights grounds because victims of crime were entitled to access to justice.\n\"That must be a possibility that is pursued... Anything else would be letting down victims,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Corrigan acknowledged the reality that in many, perhaps most cases, the best that could be hoped for is some kind of truth recovery.\nClearly, the need for the truth has trumped the desire for justice before in the peace process.\nIn the search for the Disappeared, for example, those providing information about where bodies are buried are granted immunity from prosecution.\nBut even then, there are difficulties facing up to the past.\nSandra Peake, chief executive of victims' group, WAVE, said people did not always want to engage and answer questions about where they buried someone.\n\"Some people simply don't want to go back there,\" she said.\nDealing with the past is now in the hands of the US diplomat, Dr Richard Haass.\nMs Peake said a process is needed that is centred on the victim and the survivor.\nShe suggested Dr Haass not only deal with story-telling and memorials but also re-examine the proposed Eames-Bradley legacy commission.\nMost now agree the status quo ad-hoc approach to the past, where details emerge in books and films and media interviews, cannot continue.\nDr Philip McGarry,  a consultant psychiatrist who has counselled both victims and perpetrators, said it was not possible to ignore the past, or try to move on without dealing with it.\n\"There comes a time when the denials, the half-truths and the lies will no longer, in essence, cut the mustard.\n\"People don't want vengeance but what they do want is a sense of a recognition and acceptance of what happened was clearly wrong.\"\nHe warned that unless Northern Ireland faced up to its past in a healthy way, it was destined to continue as a divided society, with violence around the edges and the potential for bad things to happen.\n\"We can't ignore the past,\" he said.\n\"As a human being it's impossible to just draw a line when you have suffered a terrible hurt.\"\nOne thing is certain,

I needed to have that feeling of getting back in the ring again,\" he said.\n\"I got through that, I coped on the night and now I know I am ready to get back and do what I set out to do in the first place, which is get that British title.\n\"I've been asked before about whether what happened with Mike affects me in the ring, in terms of hitting people and getting hit.\n\"The answer is it can't.

He got things done.\n\"He turned Foster's around with new ideas and new markets.\n\"Couple him with Walter Wilson, who was also a good engineer but a genius with things like gearboxes, and they made a brilliant partnership.\"\nOn 22 July 1915, a commission was placed to design a machine that could cross a trench 4ft (1.2m) wide.\nTo get away from the noise and distraction of Foster's factory, a suite was taken at the White Hart Hotel, in Lincoln.\n\"They locked themselves in the room and would scribble designs on envelopes and cigarette packets,\" says Mr Pullen.\n\"Anything they liked went to the factory for testing, anything they didn't went on the fire.\"\nThey knew they had to work fast.\n\"Everyone was worried the Germans would come up with a similar machine first,\" he explains.  \"It could change the course of the war.\n\"It was also viewed as a way to save the lives of men on the front by breaking the deadlock. Every day longer it took meant more British soldiers died.\"\nA first design, little more than an armoured box on US tractor tracks, known as Little Willie, was tested on 19 September.\nIt failed.\nA 5ft (1.5m) bank could not be overcome and as it crossed a trench, the tracks sagged from their rollers and came off.\nOfficials from London, who only dared whisper about the project, were dumbfounded to find workers had invited their families, complete with picnics, to the tests.\n\"When challenged,\" said Mr Pullen, \"Tritton growled that to treat the whole thing as a big secret would attract more attention.\"\nTritton had spotted the problem early and new tracks were being designed from scratch. Bigger, tougher and built to cling to their frames.\nFitted with the new system, Little Willie could cross the 4ft gap. But, the challenge had changed. The army now faced trenches 8ft (2.4m) wide.\nHowever, Wilson had also been looking ahead and had the answer ready.\nInstead of being tucked at the bottom of the machine, the tracks would go all the way round its 25ft 5in (7.75 m) length. They would also be carried on forward-sloping \"prows\" projecting beyond the crew compartment, giving it a huge reach.\nThe famous \"wonky box\" lozenge shape was born.\nVariously known as Centipede, Mother and Big Willie, it would weigh 28 tonnes.\n\"It was a design ahead of its time,\" said Mr Pullen. \"It pushed technology to the limit and beyond.\n\"The engine they had to use was not really powerful enough - steering, command and tactics were in their infancy.

Cells respond by shutting down nearly all protein production in order to halt the virus's spread.\nHowever, many neurodegenerative diseases involve the production of faulty or \"misfolded\" proteins. These activate the same defences, but with more severe consequences.\nThe misfolded proteins linger and the brain cells shut down protein production for so long that they eventually starve themselves to death.\nThis process, repeated in neurons throughout the brain, can destroy movement or memory or even kill, depending on the disease.\nThis process is thought to take place in many forms of neurodegeneration, so safely disrupting it could treat a wide range of diseases.\nThe researchers used a compound which prevented those defence mechanisms kicking in and in turn halted neurodegeneration.\nIt is rare to get cautious scientists keen to describe a study in mice as a turning point in treating Alzheimer's.\nIt is early science, a lot can go wrong between a drug for mice and a drug for humans and the only published data is for prion disease, not even Alzheimer's.\nSo why the excitement?\nIt is the first time that any form of neurodegeneration has been completely halted, so it is a significant landmark. It shows that the process being targeted has serious potential.\nIf this can be successfully developed, which is not guaranteed, the prize would be huge.\nIn Parkinson's the alpha-synuclein protein goes wrong, in Alzheimer's it's amyloid and tau, in Huntington's it's the Huntingtin protein.\nBut the errant protein is irrelevant here as the researchers are targeting the way a cell deals with any misfolded protein.\nIt means one drug could cure many diseases and that really would be something to get excited about.\nAlzheimer's Research UK: Is it a cure?\nThe study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed mice with prion disease developed severe memory and movement problems. They died within 12 weeks.\nHowever, those given the compound showed no sign of brain tissue wasting away.\nLead researcher Prof Giovanna Mallucci told the BBC news website: \"They were absolutely fine, it was extraordinary.\n\"What's really exciting is a compound has completely prevented neurodegeneration and that's a first.\n\"This isn't the compound you would use in people, but it means we can do it and it's a start.\"\nShe said the compound offered a \"new pathway that may well give protective drugs\" and the next step was for drug companies to develop a medicine for use in humans.\nProf Mallucci's lab is also testing the compound on other forms of neurodegeneration in mice but the results have not yet been published.\nSide effects are an issue.

Labour must have one eye on its history all through this.\"\nThe Leigh MP is speaking to me just ahead of a rally at St Pancras Church in central London.\nHe is proving it's not just Jeremy Corbyn who has resurrected well-attended public meetings.\nAbout 1,000 people packed in to the pews to hear Burnham and his supporting cast of Sir Keir Starmer, now the local MP but until recently the Director of Public Prosecutions, shadow minister Luciana Berger and former deputy leader Lord Prescott.\nSo just as well this was a very broad church - but whether Labour can remain so itself is in doubt.\nIn a barnstorming speech, John Prescott denounced two shadow cabinet members for setting up a 'Common Good' group and suggested this was a similar initiative to the Gang of Four who later formed the SDP in the early 1980s.\nThis time there was 'a Gang of Two' - and Prescott disparagingly denounced the pair of them: \"Chuka (Umunna) and some guy called Tris-teeh-yan (Tristram Hunt)\".\nThe crowd went wild.\nIt would be a hard act to follow. Burnham praised Prescott as \"the best warm up act\" and \"the original Northern Powerhouse\".\nThen he, too, addressed the issue of splits, in a way that was perhaps designed to reach those who couldn't recall his party's meltdown of the 1980s.\nHe announced boy-band One Direction had broken up - and added he didn't want the same to happen to Labour.\nHe had told me that he would be the person that could \"knit the party together again\" and told the audience now he was \"Labour to the core\".\nI'd asked if that meant he would serve in a Jeremy Corbyn shadow cabinet if he himself failed to win the leadership.  His rivals Liz Kendall and Yvette Cooper had said respectively \"no\" and \"not likely\" to that question.\nBurnham said there has been no discussions \"of any kind\" but \"generally I will try to help - I am on the uniting front\".\nIt took a bit of pressing for him to say that both Cooper and Kendall would feature in his shadow cabinet if he won: \"It's the wrong time to do a reshuffle but I praised Liz Kendall on what she was saying about devolution, that needs to be part of Labour's story.'\nBut would he bring all his rivals in to his shadow cabinet?\n\"I could imagine that - I want to bring people back together.\"\nBut yes, he is at his core a party man.\nHe told me he had started attending local Labour Party meetings of his Culcheth and Glazebury ward - in the Warrington North constituency - in  1984 when he was just 14, officially signing up to the party when he was permitted to do so the following year.\nBoth national and local factors had brought him in to the Labour fold.\nHe was impressed with the then leader Neil Kinnock, who is backing his leadership bid.\n\"He was the figure I related to, when he really hit his stride.. attacking Militant, taking Derek Hatton on. I remember that very vividly. It's a great source of pride to have his support.'\n(Kinnock famously denounced the far-left, Militant-controlled Liverpool City Council from the platform at Labour's 1985 conference.)\nUnlike some people of his generation, Andy Burnham was not attracted to political activity through CND.\nHe attended one meeting in Leigh - the nearby Greater Manchester constituency he now represents - with his brother \"because we were all worried about nuclear weapons at the time, it loomed large in the minds of young people  - Threads was on TV.\" This was a BBC drama which simulated a nuclear attack on Sheffield.\nBut he didn't go back - he was ultimately less concerned about abstract threats than what he regarded as the suffering in people's everyday lives.\nAnother BBC drama, this time set in his native city of Liverpool  - Boys From the Blackstuff - had been more influential.\nOne of its characters - Yosser Hughes - had had his dignity destroyed by unemployment and would utter the desperate catchphrase: \"Gizza job - I can do that!\"\nAnd the real-life drama of the miners' strike had been unfolding before his eyes.\nAlthough even as a teenager Burnham had been worried about a lack of a ballot before industrial action began, he had been struck by the hardships which those on strike were enduring.\n\"My school was right by Parkside colliery (in Newton-le-Willows, which closed in 1993) and we went past the picket line every day. I had a lot of friends whose dads were miners.\"\nSo Andy Burnham's background wasn't the most obvious for a Cambridge graduate. His father was a  telephone engineer, his mother a receptionist and he attended the local catholic comprehensive, St Aelred's High.\nBut his time amid the cloisters shaped his thinking as much as what he had seen on his doorstep.\n\"I didn't think I would fit in at Cambridge, got rejected, and told my mum and dad I was going to Newcastle instead.\n\"And this letter came out of the blue to go back and they urged me to give it another go.\n\"I don't regret it but it changed my world view. When you come from the place I was in - with low horizons - then you arrive at university and see what other people take for granted. That shaped me, seeing those two worlds and the disparity between them. I have used the phrase before but the postcode of the bed you are born in still determines where you end up.\"\nHe now wants to burst the \"Westminster bubble\" which he believes insulates those inside it from everyday life - but wasn't he for a long time an occupant?\nHe had worked for Tessa Jowell when Labour had been in opposition in the 1990s and then had been Chris Smith's special adviser at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport during Tony Blair's first term in office. He then became an MP at the age of 31.\n'I went back to where I grew up after leaving university because I couldn't get a job.\n\"I worked unpaid on a local newspaper (he now wants to end unpaid internships)  - I eventually got a job at a publishing company.\n\"I have always represented the seat where I grew up. Most MPs can't say that - it does give you a different perspective. It doesn't make you a creature of Westminster. My family are based there - I don't pay it a fleeting visit.\"\nAnd he tells me he is thinking about how to change Labour's method of selecting candidates in future.\nIt had been felt by party organisers that selecting a candidate early in a target seat would give them time to build up their profile but these selection contests can take some time - and the long haul to the election might deter people from some backgrounds and limited incomes.\n'To win a Labour Parliamentary selection you probably need to have a job where you can take three to five months off and probably need five or ten grand disposable income.\n\"It favours certain people with certain backgrounds. There should be much shorter timeframes for selection, which would be less favourable to those who build up all those connections from living in that political world. We need a big change.\"\nHe says he detected public disillusionment with politics towards the end of the last Labour government, when it hadn't heard the cries of the whole city of Liverpool over Hillsborough. where 96 football fans had died, and malicious and untrue stories had circulated about their behaviour.\nAfter Labour came to power in 1997 they considered, then ruled out, a fresh inquiry.\nBurnham was heckled by Liverpool fans when he spoke at Anfield, at the invitation of then Liverpool mayor Steve Rotherham, on the 20th anniversary of the disaster in 2009 - not because he was an Everton fan but because families felt the government was not listening to them.\nHe raised the issue at the following day's cabinet meeting. This led to the Hillsborough Independent Panel being set up and the truth about the tragedy emerging.\nWhile he was proud of his role here, he says he became increasingly aware that his party was failing to connect with those it claimed, or sought, to represent.\n'I have been feeling for a while that Labour's offer has been too timid. When I stood for leader in 2010 (he came fourth) it was part of my critique that modern politics isn't capable of giving people solutions that are big enough to inspire, that it throws out gimmicks and small scale policies that don't make a difference.\"\nSo how would he be different?\nBack at the St Pancras meeting, 17-year-old George Rogers asks the candidate if he is \"continuity Miliband\".\nBurnham chose to define his differences with the former leader by moving to his left flank, not his right.\nUnlike Miliband, he wouldn't just reduce tuition fees in England, he would scrap them. He is looking at a graduate tax, though, and admits higher education cannot simply be free for all.\nThere were other crowd-pleasers too - opposition to right to buy for housing association tenants, renationalising of the railways - incrementally, as franchises come up for renewal - and an end to charitable status for private schools.\nSo, I wondered, if he had become victim of the \"Corbyn effect\" - ramping up radical rhetoric to try to win a contest which, on the surface, might be attracting new members and supporters because the left-winger was offering an alternative to austerity and mainstream politics.\nOr was he - as one of his rivals had put it (without mentioning Burnham by name) -  \"pandering\" to Jeremy Corbyn?\n\"I don't see it that way, for obvious reasons,\" he responds.\n\"The party hierarchy have been misreading the mood amongst members - they want a different kind of politics to the insipid stuff Labour has been serving up in recent times.\n\"We can't lecture people. It's not a case of me veering completely to the left, or whatever. The substance of what Labour was saying has been too shallow. I'd already felt that. Jeremy has come in, of course, and really spoken to that.\"\nBut what appeared to put rocket boosters under Jeremy Corbyn's candidacy was the decision by the shadow cabinet to abstain on - rather than oppose - the Conservatives' Welfare Bill.\nThis had been at acting leader Harriet Harman's insistence - though in the end she tabled what is called a \"reasoned amendment\" setting out Labour's differences. Burnham had argued for outright opposition.\nHe was barracked by one of the political congregation at St Pancras over why he hadn't opposed legislation that could in future see child tax credits restricted to a family's first two children.\nHe replied that unity was strength and that he hadn't risked splitting the party on the issue.\nAnd this is what he told me: \"It was a turning point in the campaign, definitely.\n\"I argued twice in shadow cabinet that we should oppose. In the second discussion Harriet asked for everyone's views.\n\"There were a range - abstain; a reasoned amendment then abstain; and a reasoned amendment then oppose. I supported that.\n\"But too late in the day it looked like we were just going to abstain.\n\"Under the pressure I applied, the party moved to the position of a reasoned amendment. In effect this was opposition.\n\"Having forced the change I then had a decision. Did I resign from the shadow cabinet and walk my supporters through the opposite lobby from the rest of the shadow cabinet - or abide by a collective decision that was a compromise?\n\"It's different for Jeremy - he is not in the shadow cabinet and isn't bound by collective responsibility.\n\"So it was a no win situation for me - but had I resigned and possibly won the leadership at that moment, it wouldn't have been me. I have never undermine the Labour Party in Parliament.\n\"If the party becomes divided how do we put it back together on 13 September?' (the day after the new leader is announced). But It's frustrating.\"\nSo if he overcomes this political obstacle, and wins the contest, I wanted to find out what the priorities would be for a Burnham leadership.\nHe's already talked of setting up a new \"Beveridge-style commission\" after Sir William Beveridge's  wartime Social Insurance and Allied Services report, which led to the setting-up of the welfare state.\nBurnham's commission would look at reviewing the delivery of a National Health and Care service; the introduction of a universal graduate tax, and funding for apprenticeships.\nBut he is promising action before words: \"The first thing you have to do as leader of the Opposition is do what it says on the tin - oppose.\n\"I will deliver the most energetic, hard-working Opposition that this party has seen in a long time - I will run the government ragged. That's how I was forged.\n\"That's what we did pre-1997. Being an effective opposition is crucial. But the second thing is correcting the record over the economy.\"\nAnd for all the left-wing rhetoric, Burnham is determined to address two issues which Labour's own pollsters say became barriers between the party and some of its target voters - the deficit and immigration.\nThe former is, he agrees, his main point of difference with leadership rival Yvette Cooper.\n\"I acknowledged the deficit was too high in 2007 - I was Chief Secretary to the Treasury back then, and was asked to bring it down.\n\"I don't take the view that Yvette seems to - that you just say we got everything absolutely right. It just doesn't wash with people.\n\"It may work with an internal audience to say that but you have remember you can't just talk to the Labour Party here - you have got to talk to the party and the country. If you are honest about where you went wrong people are more likely to trust you going forward.\"\nBut he says the deficit can and should be brought down through tax rises, not just spending cuts and he isn't afraid to say that some taxes will need to go up.\nOn immigration, he says he has seen the adverse effects in his own constituency: \"I will talk about this a lot as leader. I don't want Labour people avoiding voters' eyes on the doorstep on this subject.\n\"I have seen people's wages undercut and agency staff brought in to do shifts. I have spoken out about someone I met on the doorstep in West Leigh who said he was the only person on his shift who spoke English. People talk about pressures on primary schools.\"\nBut Ed Miliband shifted Labour's policy - he emphasised he would tackle exploitation and advocated a two-year wait for benefits for EU migrants. So I explored whether Andy Burnham was offering merely a change in tone, or in substance.\n\"I am pro-European and believe in free movement of labour.\n\"But what I have pressed with the European Parliament President (German social democrat) Martin Schulz is that there are EU structural funds which haven't been drawn down - why can't that money be designated as a migration fund?\n\"Communities most affected would apply for this and get help for, say, extra primary school teachers or extra GPs. Europe has to understand some communities - especially the poorest - are changed by migration\"\nAnd he promises to \"go after UKIP\" on the issue and \"be in as many pubs as Nigel Farage\".\nBut were those who had turned out on an unseasonably wet, cold August night to attend Andy Burnham's London rally about to raise a glass to his leadership ambitions?\nWith all the talk of potential splits, it was perhaps encouraging that the first person I spoke to in the audience was called Unity. Yes, she really was.\n\"I always liked Andy Burnham. I have had my eye on him for a long time.\"\nHer companion, Annabel,  too was pretty positive: \"I like the talk of another Beveridge government. I think he doesn't scare the horses.\"\nHazel, on the other hand, wasn't sure whether to opt for Yvette Cooper instead. She did find Jeremy Corbyn \"wonderful and energising\" but \"No, no I remember the eighties\".\nRienzi said he was also old enough to remember the divisions of that decade too: \"I saw what ultra-left wing politics did to the party. Labour will never get in if it goes back to that.\"\nSo he wasn't backing Jeremy Corbyn but wanted to see \"if Andy Burnham is up to it.\" And he defended the Leigh MP for not attacking Corbyn: \"It might go negative on him.\"\nBut for Josh \"it's between Andy and Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy might have a problem winning over dyed-in -the-wool Tories and we could struggle on 2020\".\nYoung voters Anna and Serena were yet to cast their ballots.\nSerena said it was important to \"hear things from the horse's mouth - so far there has been a lack of clarity\".\nShe had seen Yvette Cooper and Jeremy Corbyn and the latter - even if he was \"unrealistic\" was at least clear.\nAnna said Corbyn's inclusion in the contest \"had made me more engaged but I am unlikely to vote for him. Now it's up to us to look at the policies and decide who should lead the party\".\nAndy Burnham will be hoping that sober reflection - rather than anti-austerity enthusiasm for Jeremy Corbyn - will allow him to snatch victory.\nIt's been a long haul. Indeed, he tells his church audience that the campaign \"has gone on so long I can just about remember when I was the frontrunner\".\nHe gave an impassioned performance - now he'll be hoping he can make a second coming.", "summary": "In the second of a series of in-depth profiles of the four Labour leadership candidates, Iain Watson catches up with Andy Burnham and his supporters at a campaign rally.", "id": "34063584"}, {"document": "The veteran striker opened the scoring on 52 minutes, slotting home a low strike, before firing a second into the top corner.\nDean Brotherston added a third 10 minutes from time, just moments after coming off the bench.\nJean Yves Mvoto headed in a late consolation for Raith Rovers.\nDobbie was denied a hat-trick in the closing stages with his effort coming off a post.\nBut it was smiles all round at Palmerston when news of Hibs' surprise home defeat to Ayr filtered through, meaning Gavin Skelton's men take over at the top.\nMatch ends, Queen of the South 3, Raith Rovers 1.\nSecond Half ends, Queen of the South 3, Raith Rovers 1.\nCorner,  Raith Rovers.

But then again we get visits from architects just spontaneously turning up at the ground and from football supporters the length and breadth of the country just wanting to see what is an iconic football grandstand,\" he said.\n\"There's nothing like it anywhere else in the world we think.\"\nBut the 52-year-old stand is starting to crumble and the club is working with Historic Environment Scotland on a programme of works that it is hoped will help preserve it for future generations of fans.\nThe structure, built by engineers Ove Arup and Tom Ridley, was upgraded to its A-list status in 2013.\nSimon Green, an architectural historian for Historic Environment Scotland, said the stand was typical of the designs produced by Womersley, who died in 1993.\n\"It was a revolutionary idea, working closely with Ove Arup, and pushing engineering of concrete into its absolute highest possible abstraction.\n\"He pushes everybody and Tom Ridley writes very eloquently about being forced and contorted to design this very, very high-spec building - which in effect is a for a modest small football club in a small Borders town.\n\"But being Peter he pushed and pushed and created something unique.\"\nMr Green is leading a seminar and tour of Womersley's work in October, which he hopes will raise the profile of an architect almost unknown to the wider public in Scotland.\n\"Womersley was always fascinating because every building he built, he built with passion and integrity - to the infuriation of his clients and his friends and other architects. He was exacting,\" he said.\n\"His body of work is quite small but each one has its own particular character and style.\"\nMr Green said he accepted Womersley was an \"acquired taste\" who would never penetrate the mainstream like Charles Rennie Mackintosh has done.\n\"I don't think unfortunately it will ever reach the heights of Mackintosh devotion,\" he said.\nDespite this, the historian believes it is crucial that Womersley's buildings are still used as they were intended by the architect.\n\"The idea that a building can still be used for its original purpose is really exciting - and I think that has to be encouraged and preserved as long as possible.\n\"That's the excitement of most of his houses as well, as they have stayed as residences. Particularly High Sunderland which Shelley Klein is preserving very much as her father lived in it.\"\nFor Ms Klein's part, she says she still loves living in a house designed by Womersley.\n\"It still instils me with joy and it did so for my father throughout his life - he loved this building.

But he says he never approved a dirty war against the rebels.\nIn 1992, with the support of the military, the president dissolved the Peruvian congress and courts and seized dictatorial powers.\nHe justified the measure by arguing that the legislative and judiciary had been hindering the security forces in their fight against the rebels.\nOpposition politicians said he was really seeking to escape any democratic checks on his power.\nBut he was soon vindicated in the eyes of most Peruvians by the capture of the leader of the main rebel group, the Shining Path.\nIn 1995, Mr Fujimori stood for re-election and won an overwhelming victory. Most voters cited his victories over left-wing insurgents and hyperinflation as the reason for giving him their support.\nBut a growing number of Peruvians began to voice concern that the methods used against the insurgency were also being employed against the president's democratic opponents.\nHis critics accused him of using the intelligence service led by Mr Montesinos to intimidate and spy on rivals.\nThey said he exerted unfair control on the media and the judiciary, and used government resources to support his own campaigns.\nThis criticism increased when he announced he was to stand for an unprecedented third successive term.\nAlthough he won the May 2000 elections, amid further allegations of vote-rigging, the prized third term began the start of his downfall.\nAfter the Montesinos scandal broke, the opposition gained control of Congress for the first time in eight years and dismissed Mr Fujimori on grounds of \"moral incapacity\".", "summary": "To his supporters, Alberto Fujimori was the president who saved Peru from the twin evils of terrorism and economic collapse.", "id": "16097439"}, {"document": "It follows a report on Sky News that the companies were exploring an \u00c2\u00a311bn merger.\nThe move would create one of the UK's largest fund managers, overseeing \u00c2\u00a3660bn-worth of assets.\nThe companies said the deal was subject to a number of conditions, including shareholder approvals.\nUnder the terms of the potential deal, Aberdeen shareholders would own 33.3% and Standard Life shareholders 66.7% of the combined group.\nStandard Life chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone would become chairman of the board, with Aberdeen's chairman Simon Troughton becoming deputy chairman.\nStandard Life and Aberdeen's current chief executives, Keith Skeoch and Martin Gilbert, would become co-chief executives.\nBBC Scotland business/economy editor Douglas Fraser\nThe logic of putting the firms together is to build investment clout, in competition with US-based giants such as Blackrock.\nThey want to assert that active management of funds can work for clients.\nWith those passive funds growing, this offers \"significant synergy potential\", which is likely to mean duplicate roles being shed.\nAt present, the companies employ around 9,000 people.\nThat clout as a shareholder can also be applied to shaping the decisions of companies in which the asset managers have stakes.\nRead more\nIn a joint statement, the companies said: \"It is envisaged that the board of directors of the combined group would comprise equal numbers of Standard Life and Aberdeen directors.\n\"The combined group would draw on the expertise across its markets and would endeavour to harness the talent in both companies to optimise the benefits for clients and shareholders of the combined group.\"\nLast month Aberdeen reported big outflows from its funds following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election.\nAberdeen said investor sentiment \"stalled\" following the US election result.\nEdinburgh-based Standard Life reported recently that it shook off industry \"headwinds\" last year to post a strong rise in profits.", "summary": "Fund managers Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life have confirmed they are holding talks about a possible all-share merger.", "id": "39168666"}, {"document": "But not Gillian and Craig Kelly -

which takes place on Wednesday 23 July - will cost between \u00a340 and \u00a3250. The closing ceremony on Sunday 3 August will be slightly cheaper, with a top price of \u00a3200.\nDespite claims from the organisers that the ticketing strategy was \"family-friendly\", concerns have been raised over the limit on the number of tickets for which people can apply at certain sessions.\nThe majority of the more popular events, such as swimming, athletics and track cycling, will have a four-ticket per application limit, which could exclude larger families.\nMr Speer said for about 60% of the sessions the ticket limit was eight or 10 per application.\nHowever, it was lowered to four for sessions \"where we feel confident there will be enormous demand\".\nMr Speer said: \"We want to make sure we allow the greatest number of people to have the chance to have those tickets and obviously if people are coming in and potentially ordering 10 tickets that, by definition, reduces the number of families and households that will get a chance to go.

I'm immediately struck by how little Mawardah seems to have changed - height apart - and how much my return evidently means to her, and two days later, to her sister Mutiyah who travels in from the countryside.\nAnd I feel a rush of guilt that I didn't do more to try to stay in touch after various local and foreign contacts - who'd acted as intermediaries in the early days - left the province.\n\"There is nobody to care about me - nobody loves me like my parents,\" says Mawardah tearfully, the following day.\nThe tsunami destroyed all trace of her parents - no photos of her mother or father remain, and Ita now is preoccupied with her young family, leaving Mawardah often alone with her chores, her wooden desk and a simple mattress on a concrete bedroom floor.\nBut it soon becomes clear that the disaster has shaped Mawardah's life in other, more positive ways too.\nAt the age of 21, she is a confident, intelligent and ambitious young woman.\nShe's won several educational scholarships from a local cement factory (now restored after the tsunami), and is studying English at a private college in Banda Aceh.\nOver the next two days, as we talk in her small house, visit her school and lunch with her close circle of friends, I learn more about the trials and complexities of her life, and it strikes me that Marwadah's experiences reflect the broader circumstances of Aceh in the decade since the tsunami.\nFirst there's the house - one of 140,000 built with the staggering $7bn (\u00c2\u00a34.5bn) in international aid given to Aceh.\nMarwadah's was built quickly, and it shows. The roof leaks, its walls are flimsy, and I remember some unpleasant squabbles in the early years about which relatives would ultimately own it.\nBut the building has served its purpose, and the family readily admits it is better than the home they had before 2004.\nElsewhere, it's clear that a significant number of houses are now unoccupied - they were built in a flurry by a badly co-ordinated assortment of often competing aid agencies, flush with money and sometimes more anxious to spend it fast than to address the interests of local communities.\n\"I give the aid effort 65 (out of 100),\" says Muslahuddin Daud, a World Bank official who himself nearly drowned in the tsunami.\n\"A lot of things are not perfect: $7bn - in many ways we could do better. A lot of houses are empty... redundant. We had more than 500 aid organisations and... a lot of overlapping.\nMr Daud said too much foreign money made people feel \"entitled to get aid\" and become lazy.\n\"Aceh has got stuck in terms of growth - the ability to manage the resources is not there,\" he said.\nThen there's peace.\nBefore the tsunami, Aceh was wrestling with a violent separatist rebellion. Even as an 11-year-old, Mawardah remembers the impact it had on everyone's lives - the fear, the road blocks, and the clashes in the hills behind the village.\nBut the disaster acted as an immediate catalyst for peace talks, and today the province continues to benefit from an autonomy deal that ended the conflict.\nThe new government has since introduced elements of Sharia - which many here, including Marwadah, publicly support.\nBut critics say public floggings and other punishments are an abuse of human rights, and that foreign investors are increasingly steering clear of a province that is now falling behind the rest of Indonesia in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\"We like Sharia. And I am a good Muslim,\" says Marwadah, but she believes the officials who police the new laws are often \"hypocrites\".\nLate one afternoon, we stop at Marwadah's college in Banda Aceh where she's got a Thai kickboxing class with a group of other male and female students.\n\"She's a good student. She works hard, studies hard. As a girl, she has a spirit like a boy. She's strong. She doesn't give up easily,\" says her English teacher Maulizan Za.\nHe worries about inflation, but - like almost everyone else I ask here - believes that life is significantly better and safer than it was before the tsunami.\n\"My friends are my family now,\" says Mawardah, finishing the hour-long kickboxing class and getting ready to drive back home on her sister's motor scooter.\n\"I want to be a strong woman. After I graduate from this college I will next study in America, and get a job like a reporter. I feel my future will be bright,\" she concludes, then bursts into a confident, full-throated laugh.", "summary": "It's hard to recognise Lhoknga at first.", "id": "30569176"}, {"document": "The chief executive Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes said the turnaround in the market had been unexpectedly fast.\n\"We have been surprised by the speed of development in the Chinese market in a completely different direction,\" he said.\nChinese buyers have been affected by the slump in the stock market, slower growth and a corruption clamp-down.\nHe was speaking on the day of the launch of the Dawn, Rolls-Royce's new \u00c2\u00a3250,000, 155 mph convertible, which the company described as \"the sexiest Rolls-Royce ever built\".\nMr Mueller-Oetvoes, talking to the BBC World Service's World Business Report, said: \"The whole anti-corruption campaign... is very much around investigating where your money is from, to whom you are related and so on and so forth.\n\"That of course scares people who are quite affluent, and no one wants to be visible currently in that kind of environment and people are shying away from... obvious luxury goods, and that is not only true of cars but for jewellery and for precious watches and so on,\" he added.\nBut he added: \"I am not in any way scared about that.

the one-child policy - was to be scrapped.\nIt has been replaced instead with a new, universal two-child policy that took effect on 1 January this year.\nThe old policy - introduced in 1979 to tackle what policymakers saw as the impending crisis of overpopulation - is estimated by the government to have prevented up to 400 million births, in part through the now well-documented use of forced abortions and sterilisations.\nSo it is little wonder that the mere relaxing of the limit on family size, from one child to two, has done little to assuage the fears of those who fall foul of the new rule.\nTo mark the first anniversary of the announcement, we set out to investigate what the new policy really means in practice.\nAnd what we have discovered suggests that the brutal machinery of enforcement is still in place along with the Chinese state's insistence on the right of control over women's wombs.\nIn a grey suburb of a non-descript city in eastern China, I walk, uninvited into one of the notorious family planning centres.\nIt's a cold, gloomy place the like of which can be found in towns and villages the length and breadth of this vast country.\nThe floor plan at the entrance adds to the sense of unease.\nIt shows that this shabby, run-down building contains two ultrasound rooms and three operating theatres.\nAnd when I ask one of the senior officials in charge whether those theatres have ever been used to carry out forced abortions, he pauses.\n\"Very few,\" he finally replies, before going on to insist that none have taken place for \"at least 10 years.\"\nWhere else in the world would you find a government official admitting that his colleagues have kidnapped, drugged and forcibly operated on women, no matter how long ago?\nWhere else would the qualifier \"very few\" be considered an acceptable alternative to an outright denial?\nIt is an illustration of how the one-child policy has bent and blurred the moral lines and made such state-sponsored violence seem unexceptional.\nThe official tells me that in his district, under the new two-child policy all women of childbearing age are required to report for two ultrasound examinations every year.\nThose found to be pregnant with a third baby \"will be advised accordingly\", he says.\nTo get a sense of the wider reality, I ask a female colleague to telephone a number of family planning centres at random.\nPretending to be a mother, pregnant with her third baby but wanting to keep it, she asks the officials what her options are.\nAccording to Chinese law the only legal sanction available to the state for a woman violating the family planning laws is a large fine.\nAnd, as all the officials we speak to on the phone make clear, with the change in policy from one to two children, the fine remains firmly in place.\nLevied at up to 10 times annual average income, these fines are often enough in themselves to act as a powerful disincentive to continue with the pregnancy.\nBut our research shows officials going further, engaging in coercive home visits with the aim of \"persuading\" women to have abortions.\n\"If you're reported to us, then we'll find you and we'll persuade you not to give birth to that baby,\" one said.\n\"We'll definitely find you and persuade you to do an abortion,\" said another.\nWhen asked whether our hypothetical mother might actually face physical force, rather than just heavy persuasion, one official said it was still possible \"in principle\".\nAnother, in answer to the same question, said: \"It's hard to say.\"\nAnd when asked if a woman could just have the baby and pay the fine yet another official answered: \"No. You just can't.\"\nChina's one-child policy was scrapped, not out of the recognition that a woman should be free to choose what she does with her own body and her own fertility, but because the Communist Party finally woke up to the economic consequences of the falling birth rate.\nThe irony is that the two-child policy is too little too late - not enough women are choosing to have even a second baby.\nSmall families have become the social norm.\nThat means of course that the pool of people wanting a third child will be even smaller again and some officials we spoke to seemed relatively indifferent, perhaps resigned to their diminishing power in the face of such arithmetic.\n\"If you want to give birth to your baby, just go ahead,\" one said, although he was still at pains to stress that the fine would have to be paid.\nOur survey is not scientific of course, but it does offer a glimpse into a system that remains rigid and dogmatic.\nWe found no evidence, no admission, of a forced abortion being carried out since the introduction of the two-child policy, but the threat is clearly still there.\nThe family in hiding, having escaped that threat, now face a large fine following the birth of their third baby.\n\"We don't have the money for the fine.

China realised that it had so many nationals overseas and that some of them were based in unstable countries - war zones in some cases - and so they realised that protecting them was a national interest.\"\nThis realisation established what has become a constant tension in China's foreign policy that has not yet been resolved.\nAs Mr Parello-Plesner told me: \"China has companies willing to accept risk who are out there to secure business or markets in virgin territories where there isn't necessarily a high-level of Western competition.\n\"That's why in the search for oil they have gone into Sudan.\"\nThen, on the other hand, you have the Chinese government, which is traditionally inclined towards non-interference and more risk averse and would rather stay out of troublespots.\nThese two trends converge, he says, and \"we see the Beijing government having to do much more, often in innovative ways\".\nHe gave the example of South Sudan where the Chinese are now fielding a combat battalion in the UN mission that's there to stabilise the country.\n\"But it's also part of the UN mandate that they can help to secure oil workers who are predominantly Chinese, so there you see a combination of China pursuing its national interest which works for the broader public good.\"\nThis of course raises a fundamental question - does China have the military resources needed for such interventions to protect its nationals abroad?\nIn some cases the answer is clearly yes.\nThis is now explicitly part of Beijing's new defence strategy that was published last week.\nBut, as Mr Duchatel told me, the Chinese navy's involvement in evacuations in Libya and Yemen was slightly fortuitous in that it had warships nearby, as part of anti-piracy operations in the Gulf.\nWhat about a crisis further from China's own resources - suppose an evacuation were needed in a West African country where over 30,000 Chinese passport holders might be involved?\nChina, he says, \"simply couldn't carry that out with the same level of military involvement\".\nThere are those in the West who see this growing Chinese global role as a potential threat, offering Beijing a potential excuse to justify the deployment of military forces in all kinds of places that might traditionally have been well away from its routine concerns.\nOf course, China does not yet have the means to do this.\nBut Mr Duchatel suggests that on the contrary, this could perhaps be a positive development.\n\"It is hard to think of scenarios of any evacuation from a country where the West and China would be opposed,\" he says.\nIn contrast to what is happening in the South China Sea, this is an area where there is a lot of common ground and, he argues, \"there is potential for China and the West - meaning the US and Europe - to work together to enhance stability\".\nThere are technical things the militaries could do together in cases of evacuation.\nSays Mr Duchatel: \"It is pretty clear that when there is an evacuation, China is not the only country to evacuate - Pakistan, the Europeans and the US all carry out such operations and there has to be some degree of co-ordination just to avoid competition for limited resources like landing areas.\"", "summary": "One of the chief tasks of any government is to ensure the safety of its citizens abroad.", "id": "32933447"}, {"document": "David Worthington, 51, from Pontefract, West Yorkshire, was badly injured in the crash near Wortley on 30 April and died on 6 May.\nSouth Yorkshire Police said Mr Worthington had been taking part in the amateur cycling event when the collision happened in Finkle Street Lane.\nThe force has appealed for witnesses to come forward.\nMore stories from across Yorkshire", "summary": "A cyclist who died six days after colliding with a coach while taking part in the Tour De Yorkshire Sportive has been identified.", "id": "39849272"}, {"document": "Mr Sajjan says he has been able to bolster ties between India and Canada.\nPunjab's top elected official had accused him of sympathising with a Sikh independence movement, which he denies.\nMr Sajjan also distanced himself from a recent motion passed by a Canadian provincial legislature describing 1984 anti-Sikh riots as \"genocide\".\nThe Canadian minister's six-day trip is meant as an opportunity to strengthen security and defence relations between the two nations, and he has met with his Indian counterparts and business executives.\nBut it hit turbulence when Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh alleged on a television program that Mr Sajjan was \"a Khalistani sympathiser\".\nThe Khalistan movement seeks to create a separate independent Sikh homeland in the Sikh-dominated northern state of Punjab.\nCanadian authorities have also linked Sikh separatist militants to Canada's 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 329 people.\nWithout offering names, Mr Singh also said other members of Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's cabinet held similar sentiments.

Mr Singh's political rivals have accused him of playing petty politics and humiliating the Sikh diaspora by not meeting Mr Sajjan.\nThe chief minister's refusal to meet the Canadian minister has baffled many. Mr Singh had resigned from the Congress party in protest in 1984 after the Indian security forces entered the Golden Temple at Amritsar, leading to some suggestion that he, too, had some sympathy with the separatists.\nAlso, a couple of years ago, he was photographed sharing a stage with senior Khalistani separatist leaders during a visit to Canada.\nAnd that's why there has been some suggestion that his current stand is motivated more by personal reasons - last year, the Canadian government did not allow him to hold political rallies in Toronto and Vancouver to raise funds for his election campaign.\nMinister Sajjan was also forced to tip-toe around another political controversy that has strained Canada-India relations.\nEarlier this month, Ontario's legislature passed motion declaring the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in India \"genocide\".\nSome 3,000 members of India's Sikh community were massacred in the days following the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984.\nMembers of the ruling Congress party were widely accused of encouraging the violence.\nMr Sajjan carefully noted to journalists on Wednesday that it was a private member's motion put forward by a provincial Liberal politician - and not by Mr Trudeau's federal Liberal party.\nHe also referred to the 1984 riots as \"organised massacres\" and said Canada was working with counterparts in India on getting justice for the victims.\nYork University associate professor Michael Nijhawan says the dark chapter in Indian history still resonates in both countries.\n\"It continues to be a non-resolved issue in terms of people saying justice hasn't been served,\" he said.\nBut he says Mr Sajjan has so far been successful in dampening controversy during his visit, which ends 23 April.\n\"He navigates that minefield very well,\" he said.", "summary": "Canada's Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says his official visit to India has been \"very productive\" despite political tensions.", "id": "39659169"}, {"document": "Ex-Arsenal trainee Ferrier rejected a new contract with the Wood, meaning his transfer fee will be set by a tribunal.\nThe 22-year-old was Boreham Wood's leading goalscorer last season, with 11 goals in 30 National League games.\nFerrier is the second Wood player to join Dagenham this summer, following the arrival of defender Ben Nunn.", "summary": "Dagenham & Redbridge have signed forward Morgan Ferrier on a two-year deal from National League rivals Boreham Wood.", "id": "40137261"}, {"document": "There had been fears that potential tourists would be put off by the devastation caused by the winter storms.\nHowever, Cumbria Tourism has revealed that room occupancy in June was at its highest level in a decade.\nIn July 80% of all self-catering places were booked up - for the first time since records began.\nIan Stephens, from Cumbria Tourism, said: \"These are positive figures for the county's \u00c2\u00a32.62bn tourism industry, with an increasing number of people deciding to stay in the UK for their summer holidays and making the Lake District their destination of choice.\n\"The challenge now is to maintain this momentum for the traditionally quieter months of the year.\n\"We are planning to collaborate with a range of different organisations to launch a major winter marketing campaign to promote the area as an all-year-round visitor destination.\"", "summary": "Visitor numbers in the Lake District were at record levels during the summer, new figures have shown.", "id": "37513232"}, {"document": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nKatie Clark and Olivia Federici won the \"duet free\" second round at the Olympic qualification tournament in Brazil.\nIt earned them a quota place, which has now been confirmed by the international federation Fina.\nClark and Federici will be in the mix for the two team places alongside Genevieve Randall and Jodie Cowie.\nClark, 21 and Federici, 26, retired after the 2013 World Championships, only to return to the sport last year.\nTheir retirement - along with five other Olympians in late 2013 - led to UK Sport ending funding support for the British set-up.\nSynchronised swimming lead Karen Thorpe, said: \"Achieving the Olympic quota place is a real testament to the hard work that has been done not only by Katie and Olivia but also Genevieve and Jodie.\n\"Our national coach Katie Chapman has worked tirelessly to make sure the athletes were in the best position to secure that vital quota place for the Games.\n\"We have had some ups and downs since London 2012 but this has to be a highlight for the sport.

Ben Bernanke would probably agree with him.\nBut the governor's tone was softer than usual. He had the air of the long-suffering headmaster on the last day of term - conscious he had one last chance to get his message across, but also that the students' minds are turning to other things.\nSir Mervyn was a teacher before he came to the Bank and he has remained a teacher ever since. That has been his greatest strength as governor, which has served the country very well.\nBut that urge to educate probably also explains why quite a lot of people in the city - and some in Westminster - will not be sorry to see him go. There is a fine line between teaching and lecturing, and grand, successful people do not like feeling they are being lectured.\nIn more than 20 years at the Bank he has probably taught the public more about the economy - and more about central banking - than any other single individual.\nThat was crucial in the 1990s, when inflation targets were just starting and the Bank of England was moving towards independence. It has turned out to be no less vital in the past five years, as the Bank and the country have learned what it means to have a once-in-a-lifetime financial crisis.\nI wrote quite a lot about that side of Sir Mervyn's legacy a few weeks ago, on the day of his last Inflation Report press conference.\nWhat may be less well understood here in the UK is how much Sir Mervyn King has also taught the world.\nThis was brought home to me, interviewing international figures for my final piece on his time as governor for the BBC. The former US Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers and the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, are distinguished economists themselves.\nThey each spoke of Sir Mervyn's determination, in every international meeting, to ask the difficult questions and get to the heart of what was going on.\n\"When he speaks, everyone puts down their blackberries and they listen\", George Osborne told me, \"because it's Mervyn King.\"\nBoth Stanley Fischer and Philipp Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank, said that Sir Mervyn had helped teach the rest of the world what independent central banking was all about.\nHe also played a key role, when the financial crisis was at its height, in an emergency meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in November 2008. They arrived, as usual, with a detailed communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 to sign, running to several pages.\nWith the world waiting nervously to hear what policymakers were going to do, Sir Mervyn suggested they tear up that wordy draft and replace it with a short and emphatic statement that they were going to do what it took to restore stability to world markets.\nThat one gesture didn't end the crisis, of course. It did send a very important message that the grown-ups were on the case.\nBut, as I said earlier, the constant questioning, and constant teaching, has not always gone down so well, at home or abroad.  G20 finance ministers and central bank governors don't like being lectured either.\nWhen markets took fright in the summer of 2007 and credit for banks started to dry up, the big men and women in Wall Street and the City felt their world was starting to fall apart.\nThey did not want to hear a lecture from the governor of the Bank of England, about the importance of banks and investors taking responsibility for their decisions and the risks of moral hazard.\nDefenders of the governor say those comments were overblown. They also point out that, in practice, the Bank of England injected more liquidity into the banking system in the summer and autumn of 2007 than either the US or the European central banks.\nThe Federal Reserve and the ECB made more money available up front than the Bank of England, but it was very short-term cash that had to be paid back.\nThat may be true, but even the Bank's supporters say the governor's public stance in this crucial early stage of the crisis was unhelpful, at best. Officials and Wall Street figures I spoke to on a trip to the US in September 2007 were openly exasperated. They felt he simply did not \"get\" how bad the situation was.\nThey also felt, with some justice, that the Bank of England did not have nearly enough technical understanding of the financial market developments that had given rise to it all. In effect, that had been left to the FSA, even though the Bank still had formal responsibility for preserving financial stability.\nIt is astonishing, now, to think that there was only one vote to cut interest rates when the Monetary Policy Committee met in September 2008, and it wasn't the governor's. Sir Mervyn was not the only one to underestimate how serious the crisis would become. And when the Bank cut rates, it cut them quickly.\nIt also launched an historic experiment with quantitative easing, which probably helped prevent a Great Depression-style collapse of the money supply, even if it did not magically deliver growth.\nSir Mervyn himself says posterity will judge his record. But when people say he does not have a lot of respect for what the 'masters of the universe' have done to the City of the London, I suspect he doesn't mind that at all.\nCertainly, Labour politicians don't mind that he was a bit contemptuous of the City. They do mind that he helped narrow the options for UK fiscal policy in 2010.\nRightly or wrongly, Gordon Brown was considering another fiscal stimulus, in the 2010 Budget (without, it must be said, a lot of support from the Treasury itself). But that didn't last long, after Sir Mervyn said publicly that further stimulus was not on the table.\nIn May of that year, the governor publicly endorsed the government's strategy on the deficit, only hours after the coalition was formed. History will have its judgement on that too, but it's fair to say Labour's verdict is already in.\nSo, yes, Sir Mervyn King's time as governor has been a game of two halves, with the first five years a lot less divisive than the last.\nBut, when he leaves, he will have been at the Bank not ten years, but 22, first as its chief economist then later as deputy governor and governor.\nWe don't need to wait for the history books to be written to know that he made the Bank of England a very different place in those 22 years, and also did quite a bit to change the world.", "summary": "Sir Mervyn King spent his last morning in Westminster as Bank of England governor as he had spent many others - complaining about the banks, and telling the financial markets they had got things wrong.", "id": "23051695"}, {"document": "Except of course it might signal the precise opposite.

Crispr gene editing - to turn off genes at the single-cell stage and see what happens.\nShe said that if our DNA were an entire encyclopedia, then Crispr had the precision to alter a single letter on a single page.\nShe aims to start with the gene Oct4 which appears to have a crucial role.\nIt is expressed only in a handful of blastocyst cells (pictured above in green) which go on to form all the tissues of the human body.\nShe will stop it functioning in 20-30 donated embryos and if the experiments are successful her research group will move on to other genes.\nThe knowledge gained from such studies could help pick which embryos had the best chance of resulting in a successful pregnancy in IVF.\nSuch experiments are legal in the UK as long as the modified embryos are not implanted into people.\nBut scientists need a licence from the HFEA before they can perform such studies.\nThe regulator will consider Dr Niakan's request on Thursday.\nThe field is attracting controversy with some saying that altering the DNA of an embryo is a step too far.\nDr David King, the director of the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, said: \"This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalisation of GM babies.\"\nDr Niakan said this was not the aim of her research and that: \"In the UK there are very appropriately tight regulations in this area that would make it completely illegal to move it in that direction [of genetically modified babies].\"\nWolf Reik, a genetics professor at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, said such experiments needed to be carefully monitored and regulated to prevent misuse, but they were an \"exciting prospect\".\nHe added: \"The long term impacts on understanding human development and hence on better regenerative medicine approaches will be considerable.\n\"Not everything about human development can be understood from studying model organisms such as mice or even non-human primates.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.", "summary": "A scientist has been making her case to be the first in the UK to be allowed to genetically modify human embryos.", "id": "35301238"}, {"document": "Five weeks ago, the fraudsters telephoned 65-year-old Nargess Sadjady, from west London, in a series of calls.\nPosing as staff from her bank, they can be heard persuading her to transfer the money into one of their own accounts.\nThe recordings were set up by her son, who was worried that either of his parents might fall victim to just such a fraud.\nHe installed special software on their phone, and subsequently passed the recordings to the BBC.\nOriginally the police decided not to get involved, as they said there was no realistic prospect of a conviction.\nBut as a result of the recordings, to be broadcast on Radio 4's Moneybox programme on Saturday, detectives have now decided to launch a full investigation.\nThe first call to Mrs Sadjady was from a man calling himself Mark, who claimed to be from her bank, Santander.\nHe explains that he is worried about recent fraudulent transactions on her account.\nHe comforts her by saying they have managed to stop the payments, but they might not be able to stop subsequent attempts.\nMrs Sadjady can be heard trying to resist his enquiries.\n\"I don't know you,\" she says.\n\"Really I can't give more information.

Impress has so far not had to deal with a single complaint.\nIts membership is made up of smaller community papers, websites and hyper-local news operations, among them the Brixton Bugle, Shetland News and the Scottish investigative website, the Ferret.\nThree years on from the signing of the Royal Charter on self-regulation of the press, Britain's main newspapers are all still refusing to sign up to the Leveson system.\nThe principle that unites them all in their opposition is the belief that \"recognition\" is tantamount to \"state regulation\".\nIpso, which represents most of Britain's main national and regional newspapers (the Guardian, Financial Times and Independent all chose to go their own way) is not seeking recognition.\nThat means that although Ipso says it has taken on board the recommendations of Lord Leveson, it is not interested in having an independent body, the Press Recognition Panel (PRP), check that it is actually complying with the 29 rules and standards laid out in the Leveson report.\nThe newspapers' argument is that the PRP is, despite its claims of being independent, an arm of the state.\nThis was foreseen by Lord Leveson which is why there are legal incentives to encourage the press to sign up. The main stick to prod the papers is Section 40 of the 2013 Crime and Courts Act.\nTo understand it you have to look at one of the key recommendations of Lord Leveson - arbitration. Anyone who feels their reputation has been unfairly damaged by a newspaper article has at the moment only one legal route for compensation, the libel court.\nFor most people this is simply too expensive and too risky to contemplate. Arbitration is a low-cost and quicker alternative to going to the High Court.\nSection 40 says if either newspaper or complainant refuses to take the option of arbitration they will have to pay costs in a High Court case even if they win. Britain's main newspaper owners have been resisting this being signed into law.\nIt has been passed by Parliament but is awaiting a final signature from Culture Secretary Karen Bradley. Facing questions from MPs, she said she has concerns about the effect it would have on newspapers but has not made up her mind.\nSome newspapers are reporting they have been told privately she will not sign Section 40. However, even if she does not sign it remains on the statute book and if there is some future press scandal then it will be there as a possible option.\nNewspaper opposition to Section 40 is focussed on the fear that if they do not offer an approved arbitration scheme they could face libel claims in which claimants face no risk of paying costs.\nThe economics of news are tough at the moment - this looks like a catastrophic extra financial risk for anyone who wants to resist signing up to a \"recognised\" regulator.\nSo why have Impress's members signed up to such a system? The answer is the rarely discussed \"carrot\". Section 40 works two ways.\nIf a rich and powerful individual or organisation threatens a journalist with a libel writ then arbitration offers a low-cost escape route from a ruinously expensive court case.\nThe highest settlement in Impress's scheme is \u00c2\u00a33,000. High Court actions usually cost \u00c2\u00a3150,000 at a minimum. If that individual ignores arbitration and presses on with a libel action then the High Court can force them to pay costs even if they win.\nArbitration offers a new insurance policy for investigative journalism and for websites and news organisations wanting to do stories about people with expensive lawyers. This is one reason why websites such as Byline and the Ferret have signed up to Impress.\nHad arbitration existed in the past perhaps parts of the press would have had a little more nerve with stories about highly litigious individuals such as Robert Maxwell and Jimmy Savile.\nHowever, there is also a wider point in all of this. The argument about \"state regulation\" and a \"free press\" is not as clear as it might appear.\nThe Royal Charter system of press regulation is still self-regulation. Ipso is funded and overseen by the newspapers. Impress is funded by a mix of charitable trusts and foundations.\nAmong the donors to those funders are the former boss of Formula 1, Max Mosley, and JK Rowling, neither of whom has a say over any decision-making process.\nThe Press Recognition Panel is independently appointed and would merely give self-regulation a warrant of approval that it was meeting the Leveson standards.\nHowever, large parts of the British media are regulated by an arm of the state. Sky News, ITV, TalkSport, the BBC amongst many others are all subject to regulation by Ofcom.\nHowever, only TV and radio broadcasts are subject to their rules for accuracy and impartiality. Articles on their websites are not included.\nIf you want to complain that an online video by a broadcaster is not accurate or fair then it would depend if it was on a media player, TV or a website.\nIt is complicated and far from clear to the public. It is not even clear yet whether the BBC News website will be subject to Ofcom regulation when the BBC Trust is replaced next year.\nThe old dividing lines between broadcast and print and who regulates what is breaking down. Ipso will take complaints about videos on news websites, Ofcom will not.\nSo, in conclusion, the \"recognition\" of Impress does not change much. However, if Section 40 were to be signed then the presence of Impress, an approved regulator, would change everything for Ipso.\nThe editorials and campaigning by the newspapers reflect a real fear that a single signature could make it almost impossible to continue to resist press regulation as envisaged by Lord Leveson.", "summary": "The \"recognition\" of Impress means the UK finally has a press regulator that has signed up to all the standards laid out in the Leveson report.", "id": "37767046"}, {"document": "He died in New York City on Monday from complications arising from rheumatoid arthritis, colitis and pneumonia.\n\"Words can neither describe our sorrow, nor our love and respect for all that he has given to us,\" his family and fellow band members said.\nThe Eagles were one of the most successful bands of the 1970s, with multiple hit singles, including Hotel California in 1976.\nFrey co-founded the Eagles in 1971 with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.\nHe co-wrote Hotel California with Henley and Don Felder, and composed a number of the band's biggest songs on his own, including Heartache Tonight and Lyin' Eyes.\nThe Eagles notched up more than 150 million album sales worldwide, with Hotel California and their greatest hits among the best selling in history.\nTributes have been paid on social media, with country star Tim McGraw writing: \"His music was personally inspirational, his impact immeasurable, his legacy timeless. #glennfrey #heartachetonight\"\nPaul Stanley from Kiss added: \"SHOCKED to report the death of GLENN FREY.

Frey used to describe their break-up in two words - \"Hotel California\" - explaining that the pressure of following up that record tore the band apart.\nIn 1980, Henley famously said the Eagles would reform \"when hell freezes over\". Fourteen years later, that became the title of the band's comeback album, as the old friends made amends.\n\"He was like a brother to me; we were family, and like most families, there was some dysfunction,\" Henley said in a statement.\n\"But, the bond we forged 45 years ago was never broken, even during the 14 years that the Eagles were dissolved.\"\nAfter the Eagles' acrimonious split in 1980, Frey enjoyed success as a solo artist, most notably with The Heat is On, recorded for the 1984 film Beverly Hills Cop.\nThe band reunited in 1994 and became a hugely popular touring act.", "summary": "Eagles guitarist Glenn Frey has died at the age of 67, the band has announced.", "id": "35349025"}, {"document": "Trials conducted in Guinea, one of the West African countries most affected by an outbreak of Ebola that ended this year, show it offers 100% protection.\nThe vaccine is now being fast-tracked for regulatory approval.\nManufacturer Merck has made 300,000 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine available for use should Ebola strike.\nGAVI, the global vaccine alliance, provided $5m for the stockpile.\nResults, published in The Lancet medical journal, show of nearly 6,000 people receiving the vaccine, all were free of the virus 10 days later.\nIn a group of the same size not vaccinated, 23 later developed Ebola.\nOnly one person who was vaccinated had a serious side effect that the researchers think was caused by the jab.

What we don't know is what that means in other currencies, and how much the rest of the range will cost. It's thought the gold-cased version could cost as much as $10,000 (\u00a36,614), and it looks as though even the basic models will be priced at a level which will make it a far-from-casual purchase. By contrast, the new Pebble Time, the latest version of the most popular smartwatch to date, is going to cost $199 (\u00a3132).\nApple has been signalling that the watch will need recharging every night - and there are some hints that really heavy users could find they run out of juice midway through the day. We've got used to that with smartphones - will we be so happy about yet another gadget which needs constant recharging? Some smartwatches last much longer on a charge, notably the Withings Activite Pop which has a battery lasting eight months. But they can do much less, which brings us to our key question\u2026.\nThe demos we've seen so far show the Watch providing some of the notifications you get on an iPhone, combined with tracking your physical activity and your heart rate. That's similar to what plenty of other devices do, but what will be key is the user interface. Apple has shown in the past - notably with the iPhone and iPad - that it can take existing technologies and make them far more attractive and easy to use.\nWe know that the mobile payments service Apple Pay will work with the watch, and could provide a compelling use for it. Right now, that is only available in the US, but it's thought it could be coming to the UK this year. So far, Apple Pay has been a big hit, but has also been popular with fraudsters, although that appears to be the result of lax identity checks by the banks rather than a fault with the technology. Today's event provides an ideal opportunity for Apple to take its mobile payments system  to the next stage, while providing reassurance about security.\nThis is one question unlikely to be answered today. But here's a safe bet - within a week of the Apple Watch going on sale it will be the best selling device on the market. But that is not a high hurdle to clear when fewer than five million smartwatches were sold in 2014, according to research firm Canalys.

The reports were wrong. They soon changed to claims that he was moving to another post before confirmation that he was, in fact, staying put.\nA delighted Mr Hunt, who having served nearly four years is already one of the NHS's longest-serving health secretaries, later tweeted \"reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated... thrilled to be back in the best job in government\".\nRumours abound as to the reasons why he was kept on. Did someone else refuse the post? Did Mr Hunt himself plead to stay put? Possibly.\nOr perhaps, with the junior doctors' dispute still raging, the new prime minister didn't want to give the impression there was any going back on the imposition of the new contract which Mr Hunt had started to force through.\nNor will it have been missed by Mrs May that he is also overseeing another key contract renegotiation - the consultants' contract.\nTalks have been taking place since the autumn and are now delicately poised as the government tries to realise its ambitions for a seven-day NHS.\nBut away from the pay of doctors, Mr Hunt still has plenty more on his plate.\nNHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has called it the new smoking such is the risk it presents to the health of the nation.\nFor some time, the government has been working on a solution. Its child obesity strategy was due to be published before Christmas, was then delayed until the new year and then until after the referendum.\nEven after the result of the vote was announced, government sources were briefing it could still be published before Parliament breaks for the summer next week as David Cameron had taken a personal interest in it and wanted to finish his premiership with some positive policies.\nThe speed with which Mrs May has been appointed has probably ended any hope of that. But it would be no surprise if Mr Hunt tried to dust if off and get it published as soon as is practically possible.\nThe government has already committed to a sugar tax - and the obesity strategy was expected to reiterate that as well as setting out how ministers were to tackle everything from the promotion of food in supermarkets to the way it is advertised on TV.\nIf nothing else, it should generate some good headlines for Mr Hunt - unlike some of the other decisions that await him.\nDespite getting extra money this Parliament, the health service is in the grip of the worst cash crisis in its history. NHS trusts, which run hospitals, ambulances and mental health units, finished the 2015-16 year \u00c2\u00a32.45bn in the red.\nPaying that off threatens to gobble up much of the extra money coming the way of the health service.\nSenior bosses have already started work on getting NHS trusts on a better financial footing - in fact an announcement was expected this week before events have, seemingly, put a stop to that.\nMr Hunt will want to get to grips with the issue quickly to ensure his credibility doesn't suffer another blow. Some are even suggesting he should try to get more money out of the new chancellor.\nIf it wasn't for the junior doctors' dispute, the declining performance in the NHS would undoubtedly have received more attention. Targets are being missed left, right and centre.\nOver the last year or so, waiting times have risen for A&E, cancer care, routine operations and ambulances with some reaching their worst level for a decade.\nMost experts agree that the NHS simply cannot keep up with what is being asked of it and some clear direction of what should be prioritised is needed.\nLast year, ministers relaxed the waiting time target for routine operations, while committing themselves to speeding up how long patients have to wait for cancer tests.\nThere is an argument for going even further. Relaxing the four-hour A&E target could make a big difference, but it would be a brave health secretary who tells the 20 million-plus patients who use emergency departments each year that they should wait a bit longer.\nMr Hunt also faces a wider workforce problem. There are shortages of staff in many areas - an estimated one in 10 nursing posts is currently vacant - and there is a fear the prospect of Brexit could make the situation even worse by deterring EU workers - an increasingly important source of staff - from working here.\nWhile medicine has benefited from technological advancements, the NHS has undoubtedly failed to get to grips with how digital technologies have revolutionised the way we communicate and receive services.\nFor example, when was the last time you emailed your GP or logged on to book an appointment with a hospital consultant? Similar communication issues exist within the NHS itself with staff still relying on paper records and documents to share information when the rest of the world relies on electronic means.\nMoney has been promised to rectify this. But the NHS is waiting for the Wachter Review - led by US digital guru Bob Wachter - to report.\nIt was expected to be published in June, but became another victim of the EU vote and is now expected in the autumn.\nMaking a success of its recommendations will be a tough job. The last major IT drive the NHS embarked on - the \u00c2\u00a312bn National Programme for IT in 2002 - ended in failure with many of its original aims going unfulfilled or scaled back.\nIt received little attention this week, but the publication of the annual budget survey by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services made grim reading.\nDespite ministers giving councils the ability to raise council tax by 2% to help pay for care services for elderly and disabled people, the system is still drastically underfunded, the survey suggested.\nSocial care chiefs did not mince their words, saying this will lead to cuts in services, which they argued would have a direct knock-on effect for the health service - and you only need to look at the record levels of delays hospitals are already experiencing discharging patients because of a lack of community care.\nThe government did have a policy to get the public more engaged with their care needs in their old age - a cap on costs - but this has been punted into the long grass.\nThe growing problems are not ones, many believe, the health secretary can allow to fester for much longer. But there's a reason why ministers have tried and failed to reform the system since a royal commission called for it to be completely overhauled in 1999 - it's incredibly difficult without chucking a whole load of money at it.\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter", "summary": "Barring the appointment of Boris Johnson as foreign secretary, the decision to keep Jeremy Hunt in the health brief in England was perhaps the biggest surprise of Theresa May's new cabinet.", "id": "36776687"}, {"document": "The team of scientists hope the information will help shift the focus away from the way trees look towards on the focus on biodiversity.\nOver the next decade, the urban environment is expected to increase by nearly 30%.\nDetails have been published in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal.\n\"We wanted to place the focus on city and urban locations when choosing trees, but not on the aesthetic aspects,\" said co-author Juliane Vogt from the Institute of Forest Growth and Forest Computer Science at Techische Universitat Dresden, Germany.\nShe told BBC News that the goal of the database was to \"find the right tree for the right place\".\n\"City planner tend to like 10 to 15 species of tree, and they like to plant them again and again - that's not really biodiversity,\" Dr Vogt observed.\n\"This is why we put in 390 trees and shrubs into the database so there was a huge range of different species and varieties.\nDr Vogt added that she hoped that professionals, such as city planners and landscape architects, would use the database, adding \"but we also think it will be of interest for homeowners if they have a garden and want to find out what sort of tree would be suitable\".\nShe said that there were numerous benefits associated with city trees, such as shading and reducing the urban heat island effect, which make towns and cities several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas.

I kept changing things.\"\nHardy cornered the market in the role of blustering aristocrat, often dressed in tweed.\nHe appeared in The Far Pavilions, The Cleopatras, Bramwell and Middlemarch, and on the big screen in The Shooting Party and Sense and Sensibility.\nHe explained: \"When you've lived a goodish span as I have, it's a case of roaming round the attic and borrowing a few characters.\"\nDespite this range, Robert Hardy's own volatility and ability to express his wrath were channelled most successfully into his many portrayals of Britain's most revered premier.\nHe played Winston Churchill many times, even once in French on stage in Paris, but most memorably in the 1981 mini-series The Wilderness Years.\nHardy said himself of his complete immersion into the character, \"My family complained loudly about my behaviour while I was playing him.\"\nHe was married twice and had three children. Awarded a CBE in 1981 for his services to acting, Hardy was also a keen student of military history and supported the project to raise the Mary Rose.\nIn 1995, he gave up his long-time home in Oxfordshire, to become laird of a Scottish mansion, a 13th Century miniature castle situated near Edinburgh, complete with a walled garden and 50-foot tower.\nThe actor had visited the place as a child and sworn always to return, following in the footsteps of a previous visitor, Sir Walter Scott, one of Hardy's personal heroes.\nIn later years he suffered from cancer of the colon, but recovered to resume as busy a career as ever, including film work.\nAlthough he failed to make the lasting impact on Hollywood enjoyed by some British actors, his face became known the world over when he appeared as the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, in several of the Harry Potter films.\nHe was dropped from the role after the studio balked at paying a \u00c2\u00a31 million life insurance premium which was demanded because of his advancing age.\nOff screen he became something of an authority on the English longbow, his interest having been stimulated when, as a child, he found two of the weapons in the family attic .\nHe wrote two books on the history of the weapon as well as presenting a BBC documentary on the subject.\nHardy's on-screen temper was matched by a famously short fuse away from the camera and he admitted that, as an actor, he belonged to a set of \"difficult people\".\nHe once reflected: \"The ego may be essential for survival in the wilderness of acting, but it's something that requires a great deal of control if you're going to make a success of life.\"", "summary": "With his instantly recognisable voice and British bulldog manner, Robert Hardy enjoyed a distinguished acting career which spanned eight decades.", "id": "13783739"}, {"document": "Murray, who beat Zverev 6-3 6-4 in the Hopman Cup last week, believes the 18-year-old is an ever-improving player.\nZverev, who is 6ft 6in, beat Murray's Wimbledon conqueror, world number 12 Kevin Anderson, in last year's event.\n\"He's still filling out his physique but he's got a very good game and he serves well,\" said Murray.\n\"For a big guy, he moves pretty well too.

This then spreads throughout the atmosphere before being deposited in sediments on the ground, where it remains for millions of years.\n\"If you can see a big spike in mercury in those sediments, you can infer there is volcanism happening at that exact time,\" explained Mr Percival.\n\"And that's what we see at the time of this extinction.\"\nThe researchers found evidence for huge pulses of volcanic activity that would have continued for about a million years.\nProf Tamsin Mather from Oxford University said: \"You get these fissures, these cracks opening up in the Earth's crust, and probably some fire fountains, and also lava flows opening up.\n\"You probably had different areas active at different times during the million years. And you likely get eruptive periods going on for a decade or so with enormous volumes of magma coming to the surface and gases as well.\"\nAnything living in the immediate vicinity of the eruptions would have fared badly. But creatures living far away would also have been in trouble: the repeated eruptions would have had a devastating impact on the wider environment, blocking out the Sun and leading to rising levels of carbon dioxide.\nThis would have triggered a major mass extinction:  animals including vast crocodile-like creatures and reptilian-looking mammals and early amphibians were wiped out.\nHowever, early dinosaurs from that period clung on, although researchers are not sure how they survived the hellish conditions.\nBut once the volcanoes had simmered down, few of their competitors were left, allowing the age of the dinosaurs to begin.\nThe researchers now want to use mercury to look at other periods of ancient volcanic activity.\nProf Mather said: \"I think what's really exciting is that we are talking about an episode of volcanism that happened 200 million years ago, and these mercury records in the sediments are allowing us to say new things about volcanism that happened that far back in

Energy suppliers and distributors will have to save 1.5%  each year from 2021 to 2030.\nThere will also be a big focus on renovating older buildings. This sector accounts for 40% of Europe's energy consumption and the proposal aims to create a building renovation market with a value of up to 120bn euros by 2030.\nThe EU says that their Smart Finance for Smart Building initiative will allow member states to unlock an additional 10bn euros in public and private funds until 2020.\n\"I'm particularly proud of the binding 30% energy efficiency target,\" said EU climate commissioner Miguel Arias Ca\u00c3\u00b1ete.\n\"It will reduce our dependency on energy imports, create jobs and cut more emissions.\"\nWhile welcoming the move on efficiency, campaigners believe the EU could have gone even further.\n\"It is good to see this commitment from the EU,\" said Brook Riley from Friends of the Earth.\n\"It is a real achievement and it will lift millions of people out of energy poverty and increase emissions cuts, but all of these elements are better with higher ambition. Why stop at 30%? Why not go further and meet the EU's full potential?\"\nThe Commission also re-iterated its policy of having renewables make up at least 27% of final energy consumption by 2030, including a 50% share of electricity production.\nHowever, in markets where they already have a 15% share, green energy producers will no longer have priority to sell their power to the grid over traditional producers such as coal and gas - a negative development according to many environmental campaigners.\nThe Commission's plan also aim to encourage individual consumers and community groups to produce their own power.\nSmall-scale renewable installations will still have priority on the grid  - but there will be a limit on the size of the community or individual power supply.\n\"It is scandalous to cap the size of renewable energy cooperatives and bias market access in favour of inflexible fossil fuel giants,\" said Tara Connolly from Greenpeace\n\"Europe will only meet its climate responsibilities if it enables its citizens to accelerate the transition to 100% renewables.\"\nAnother contentious issue is the proposal to limit subsidies for fossil fuels in what are called capacity mechanisms, reserve supplies of power that member states keep on tap to prevent blackouts.\nThese are often coal or gas fired plants but the Commission wants to impose a limit of 550 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour, which would rule out older coal plants but not newer, more efficient ones.\n\"The CO2 limit proposed for capacity markets is a bad joke, said Christian Schaible from the European Environmental Bureau.\n\"It impacts practically none of the existing EU coal fleet and fails to address the toxic health and other environmental impacts of coal.\"\nSupporters point out that these capacity mechanisms will now have to be open to cross border competition and will include schemes which cut demand as a way of ensuring more power is available.\nOne area where the Commission is making a sharp U-turn is on the use of crop-based biofuels in transport.

Over the next four years, it was steadily weakened by a US troop surge and Sunni Arab tribal fighters who rejected its brutality.\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi became leader in 2010 and began rebuilding ISI. The following year, ISI joined the rebellion in Syria, which offered it a safe haven and easy access to weapons, some of them supplied by US allies opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe group also exploited withdrawal of US troops from Iraq at the end of 2011 and widespread Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of the country's Shia-led government.\nISI changed its name to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis or Isil) in 2013 and began seizing territory in Syria.

He sells seeds.\nYes, you read that correctly, but these aren't any old seeds, they are instead rather special ones from South America called tagua.\nThey are the off-white coloured seeds of six species of palm trees. They can reach up to 9cm (3.5 inches) in length and when dried become very hard indeed. So hard in fact that they are also known as \"vegetable ivory\".\nAnd like ivory, tagua can be polished and carved, and turned into ornate carvings or jewellery.\nFrom his base in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, Mr Heerma van Voss's company Naya Nayon has been exporting tagua for 16 years, and he says that sales are booming.\nHe now sells to 70 countries, including China, Japan and Singapore, as tagua grows in popularity as an alternative to ivory.\nAnd with China pledging to end its domestic trade in elephant tusks by the end of this year, Mr van Voss is hopeful that demand is going to jump even further.\nUsing tagua as a substitute for ivory is nothing new. Indeed exports to Europe began in the 19th Century in order to meet the demand for an ivory-like raw material. This was used to produce ornamental items such as buttons, chess pieces, and decorative handles for canes.\nIn fact, the scientific name for the six species of palm trees that produce tagua is Phytelephas, which means elephant plant, a nod to the ivory-like quality of the seeds.\nHowever, tagua fell into obscurity, so much so that Mr Heerma van Voss had never heard of it when he first visited Ecuador in 2000.\nVery much liking the country he decided to stay and set up a business, launching Naya Nayon to make and export wooden furniture. Then a year later he had a phone call.\n\"In the beginning of 2001, a France-based British lady contacted me if I could supply hand carved tagua figurines,\" he says.\n\"Anyhow, you listen to clients to make a company work. So I did it, and I started to like the tagua and slowly it took off.\n\"I always joke that I am a forced ecologist, but I actually really like this product.\"\nMr Heerma van Voss now sells $200,000 (\u00c2\u00a3160,000) worth of tagua per year that he buys from farmers. He and his four members of staff dry and slice the seeds ready to be turned into jewellery, with France being his largest market.\nThe sliced tagua typically retails for $30 a kg, while the raw seeds sell for $6 a kg. By contrast, a kilogramme of ivory is worth as much as $1,100 in China.\nWhile Mr Heerma van Voss is preparing for a big upturn in exports to China, tagua does face two hurdles in the country.\nFirstly, even the longest tagua seeds are much shorter than the average elephant tusk, which limits the size of the ornaments that can be made from the material. And secondly, it lacks ivory's exclusivity.\nHongxiang Huang, a Chinese journalist and anti-ivory campaigner, explains: \"As people become wealthier they want to buy luxury items, and ivory is one of the many things that people desire. This is the situation in China.\"\nFor buyers wanting an alternative to elephant ivory that still comes from a mammal but is ethically sourced, the answer comes from under the frozen Siberian tundra in the north east of Russia.\nIt may sound bizarre, but the tusks from woolly mammoths that died tens of thousands of years ago are mined on a regular basis. While official figures are not available, an estimated 60 tonnes of mammoth ivory is harvested each year.\nMammoth ivory sold for an average $350 a kg in 2014, according to the charity Save the Elephants. This is about a third of the price of elephant ivory, but giant mammoth tusks in good condition can fetch far more.\nJohn Frederick Walker, an expert on ivory, says: \"Master carvers tend to prefer elephant ivory because fresh elephant ivory is easier to carve.\n\"But in fact, you can make wonderful things from mammoth ivory.\"\nYet with tagua far easier to get hold of than mammoth ivory, and considerably cheaper, it is the South American seeds that is increasingly being used by jewellers, and not the Siberian tusks.\nMarion Andron is co-owner of French jewellers Nodova, which sold more than 300,000 euros ($320,000; \u00c2\u00a3256,000) of tagua jewellery last year.\nMs Andron, 27, travels to Ecuador twice a year to oversee the production of the tagua that is done by seven local women at a cooperative.\nWhile Nodova's largest markets are France and the UK, it sells to stores across Asia and Ms Andron says that the forthcoming blanket ban on ivory sales in China offers a huge opportunity.\n\"I think tagua has helped diminish the demand for animal ivory, and I honestly don't think someone today can be ignorant about the slaughter of elephants with all the media coverage,\" she says.", "summary": "Onno Heerma van Voss jokes that he never intended to be a conservationist, but he is helping to save the African elephant.", "id": "39333386"}, {"document": "At the top, but not in the inner circle.\nAs the first Muslim woman to sit in the cabinet she was a crucial symbol of David Cameron's efforts to modernise the Tories.\nBut now she has left the government - and in a way designed to inflict damage.\nThe prime minister was only told shortly about her decision to quit before she announced it on her Twitter feed.\nShe'd also done an interview, explaining her decision, which was published on the Huffington Post website within the hour.\nDavid Cameron's response to her resignation contained a jibe - he had \"much regret\" she hadn't talked to him about her concerns before she quit.\nBut there was also a warm tribute.\n\"I would like you to know how much I have personally appreciated your support and friendship over the years' he wrote.\nThere is no evidence though that Mr Cameron is changing his mind or re-assessing the government's stance on Israel's conduct during this war.\nThe prime minister has faced criticism from some in his own party for not condemning Israel for what they believe is its disproportionate use of force against Hamas and civilians in Gaza.\nHe described an attack on Monday as a \"slaughter\" and he said the situation was \"intolerable\".\nOther senior ministers have called it a \"catastrophe\".\nBut neither Mr Cameron nor any Conservative minister has said that Israel has gone beyond what is proportionate.\nThe response on Tuesday afternoon from the new foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, was telling.\nWhat Lady Warsi has labelled a \"morally indefensible\" position he has dismissed as a call for \"megaphone diplomacy\".

Yet most of us go on to live what by most measures are pretty ordinary lives.\nSo what's wrong with settling for mediocrity?\nListen to Manuela's programme: How to be Mediocre\nIt's a subject that became a field of study for two Italian academics, Gloria Origgi, a researcher and philosopher at the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris, and Diego Gambetta, a professor of sociology at Oxford University.\nIt all started over a decade ago when they met up and got chatting about their experience of working and studying overseas, comparing it to how things were done in Italy.\nThey exchanged stories about turning up at Italian conferences and finding that workshops had:\nIt wasn't how things were organised in France and the UK, where the two academics had now settled.\nThey decided to dig deeper, going beyond their own anecdotal experiences. The result was an Oxford University paper about what they call \"kakonomics\" - kakos being ancient Greek for bad.\nTheir premise was straightforward: sometimes parties conspire, whether consciously or unconsciously, to achieve the lowest possible outcome - the most mediocre outcome.\nBut why?\nIt appears it has to do with people shunning a perceived tyranny of excellence.\n\"Sometimes all this rhetoric about efficiency is just unbearable so people like to have a chance to just ease up,\" says Ms Origgi.\nIt goes some way to explaining Italy's fabled la dolce vita - its famously laidback lifestyle. But if the old adage is that all good things in life are free, then la dolce vita comes at a price and the price is high standards.\nTake the case of Italian olive oil manufacturer Leornardo Marseglia, who was charged with fraud in the 1990s for selling adulterated oil under the label \"extra virgin\", something that should denote it is of superior quality, say Origgi and Gambetta.\nEven in Italy, extra virgin olive oil is expensive, and when Mr Marseglia was later acquitted he justified himself by arguing that thanks to his adulterated oil many people could afford to buy it with the label \"extra virgin\" at a reasonable price.\nMr Marseglia told The New Yorker magazine that at home, his family used ordinary oil anyway: \"For us, the concept of 'good' is enough. We want to be average folks.\"\nBut the route to mediocrity isn't always paved with such disingenuity.\nFor Krista O'Reilly Davi-Digui, who lives in Canada with her husband and three children, it is heartfelt.\n\"When I say I'm mediocre, I am,\" she says, posing the question in a recent blog, What if I am mediocre and choose to be at peace with that?\n\"I love to learn but I'm not the most brilliant person. I like to write but that doesn't mean I'm the greatest writer. I'm just kind of plain.\"\nKrista studied for an education degree, dropped out after suffering bouts of anxiety and depression, and is now a certified holistic nutritionist and \"joyful living educator\".\n\"The messages are always do more, be more, sacrifice sleep for productivity, bigger is better, rush, rush, rush,\" she says.\n\"It just destroys me. I feel like that isn't life and I don't want it and I can't even begin to keep up. So many of us just want to get off that hamster wheel and just breathe.\"\nBut many of us never do. For some, sheer hard work may transform that wheel into a ladder, but what if it doesn't? What if all that hard work goes to waste?\nMark Manson is a popular blogger on personal development issues who gets thousands of emails from readers every year. More recently he noticed that a lot of the advice people were looking for was for issues that weren't really problems at all\nRather, they were worrying about their achievements, about not excelling or standing out in their chosen field.\n\"The fact is that they just fall into the 99% of achievement which, you know, we all do,\" he says.\nThe problem, Mr Manson argues, is that social media ensures we're constantly exposed to the highlight reel of people's lives and that's leaving some feeling like they're not quite making the most of their time on this mortal coil.\nHe says that while \"mediocrity, as a goal, sucks... as a result, is OK\".\nIt's similar to the conclusion Gloria Origgi and Diego Gambetta came to in their study.\nMs Origgi recalls the experience of an American friend who was renovating a house in Italy. The Italian builders never delivered when they promised to but conversely they didn't expect payment on time either, so both sides gained something.\nIn the end though, the renovation was never completed, which wasn't perhaps what the American friend had bargained for.\nBut in general, the deal is you give up high standards and in return you get flexibility and an overall easier, more laidback life.\nWhich brings us back to Krista O'Reilly Davi-Digui.

But due to the fact that the use of robotic systems is increasing \"exponentially\", they add, this means that the number of accidents is increasing every year.\nThey highlight that when problems do occur, people are several times more likely to die if the surgery involves their heart, lungs, head and/or neck rather than gynaecological and urological procedures.\nThey acknowledge that the data does not pinpoint why, but suggest it is because the former are more complex types of operations for which robots are less commonly used, so there is less experience and expertise available.\nThe researchers did not, however, compare accident rates with similar operations in which robots were not used. Their study has not been peer reviewed.\nSurgical robotic devices are typically expensive - costing millions of pounds - but offer advantages.\nThey can allow surgeons to use smaller instruments, letting them make smaller and more nimble cuts. That can mean patients recover faster, with less risk of infection and the promise of smaller scars.\nIn addition, the development of remote surgery means that doctors do not always need to be in the same room as their patients, allowing specialists who are in demand to treat more people.\nDespite these benefits, sales of surgical robots declined by 2% in 2013 - the most recent year for which figures have been published by the International Federation of Robotics.\nThat has been linked to some medical experts questioning claims that the cost of using such machines is justified by improved outcomes.\n\"There is no good data proving that robotic hysterectomy is even as good as - let alone better - than existing, and far less costly, minimally invasive alternatives,\" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in 2013.\n\"Aggressive direct-to-consumer marketing of the latest medical technologies may mislead the public into believing that they are the best choice.\"\nOthers specialists have, however, vouched for such systems' benefits in other procedures.\n\"The Royal Marsden has performed more robotic surgical procedures for prostate cancer than any other hospital in the UK,\" states the London hospital's website.\n\"We have dramatically improved functional and oncological outcomes for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy [the removal of the prostate gland to treat cancer].\"\nAlthough the study links hundreds of injuries and deaths to robotic surgery, in most cases the FDA's logs do not make clear whether the use of the machines was directly responsible.\nIn fact, of the headline figures, only a minority - five of the deaths and 436 of the injuries - are specifically tied to technical errors that occurred during an operation.\nBut the authors say there is still reason to be concerned.\nThey list 1,166 cases of broken/burned parts falling into patients' bodies, which contributed to 119 injuries and one death.\nUncontrolled movements and spontaneous powering on/off of the machines are said to have caused 52 injuries and two deaths.\nElectrical sparks, unintended charring and damaged accessory covers are linked to 193 injuries, including the burning of body tissues.\nAnd the loss of quality video feeds and/or reports of system error codes are said to have contributed to a further 41 injuries and one death.\nThe report's authors suggest that one way to tackle such problems would be to give surgical teams more troubleshooting training -

We can forcefully pinch our thumb and little finger together, for example - something that is much more difficult for relatively short-thumbed apes.\nThis is part of why we are so good at making and using tools.\nThe structure of Homo naledi's hands indicates it also probably had some of this capability, says Tracy Kivell from Kent University, UK.\n\"The features that we see particularly in the wrist, we've only ever found in Neanderthals and [modern humans], and we know that those are committed to using tools,\" she told BBC News.\n\"They make tools, complex tools, and use them all the time, enough so that it's actually changed their morphology.\n\"Perhaps naledi was using tools that were made out of different materials or doing some other forceful, precision-grip manipulations, but the most straight-forward explanation is that naledi is making and using tools.\"\nNo tools were found with the hominin's remains inside the Rising Star Cave in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site outside Johannesburg, so no direct association can be made.\nThat leaves room for uncertainty, and a conundrum: this was a creature that may have lived two million years ago with a brain comparable in size to a modern chimpanzee's. Would it really have had the cognitive capacity to be a skilled tool-user?\nThis puzzle may be answered in due course.  Only a small fraction of the cave has been excavated, and future work could yet provide some tool discoveries.\nCertainly, more naledi remains are a given. Bones from perhaps 15 or more individuals have so far been recovered.\nThese include nearly 150 hand-bone specimens, including the near-complete right hand of an adult. Its only missing feature is the pisiform - the little knobbly bone on the outside of the wrist.\nAs the Wits University-led scientists excavated the cave-floor sediments to reveal the hand, they scanned every step of the process to record each bone's exact position.\n\"The near-perfect articulation means that when that individual was put there or died there, the bones were not subsequently disturbed or moved.  There can't have been water flowing through the cave, for example, because those little bones of the wrist and the finger-tips would have been the first to disappear,\" said Dr Kivell.\nAmong the 107 foot-bones recovered at Rising Star is a well-preserved right adult foot.\nLike the hands, the feet of naledi are predominantly modern human-like in their shape, and in their inferred function. In other words, naledi could walk very well.\nBut just like the hands, they differ from modern humans' feet in the curvature of the phalanges - the toe bones. The arch was lower, too.\n\"This was an animal that was bipedal; it was very comfortable on the ground,\" William Harcourt-Smith, from Lehman College CUNY and the American Museum of Natural History, told BBC News.\n\"You can imagine that during the day, when it was out and about, it was mostly on the ground. But for things like going to feed or to hide from predators, it would have gone into the trees, because we see that it has retained some of these more primitive features in the foot. So: much more bi-pedal than not, but not 100%.\"\nOne of the big outstanding questions concerning Homo naledi is its precise position in time.\nWhen the Wits team announced the discovery last month, no age was given for the remains. This is still being worked on.\nBut from the look of many body features, such as the shape of the chest and shoulders, the creature is assumed to sit at the base of the Homo family tree.\nThis may well change when the dating quest finally yields a result.  Scientists may then learn that naledi, far from being two million years old, is actually a creature from much nearer in time.\nThis would provide echoes of the Indonesian species Homo floresiensis, which, despite having some very primitive traits, was shown to be living perhaps as recently as 12,000 years ago.\n\"And then you have a remnant lineage in South Africa, alongside other species that are much more advanced, hanging on and doing well quite late into the record. Again, that would speak to diversity and experimentation in the Homo genus,\" speculated Dr Harcourt-Smith.\n\"And then if naledi really is very old, it's fascinating too because it's something in South Africa rather than East Africa that is very distinct, and again points to a lot of experimentation in the emergence of Homo.\n\"So it's win-win whatever the dating shows.\"\nDrs Kivell, Harcourt-Smith and colleagues have published their descriptions of the hands and feet in the journal Nature Communications.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "summary": "The human ancestor Homo naledi was something of an all-rounder, able to move efficiently on the ground but also adept at climbing in trees.", "id": "34457572"}, {"document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device\n1 January 2015 Last updated at 20:34 GMT\nThe unit was set up to replace the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).\nBBC News NI's Home Affairs Correspondent Vincent Kearney reports.", "summary": "A new PSNI legacy unit has today taken over the Bloody Sunday investigation and a review of letters sent to about 200 so-called republican On the Runs.", "id": "30652901"}, {"document": "Response said its contract would end on 15 April after the satellite broadcaster reduced its number of outsourced suppliers from nine to two.\nAbout 950 Response staff, who work on the Sky account, will transfer to new supplier, Herotsc.\nThe Falkirk-based firm plans to run the Sky account from a new call centre in Glasgow's Atlantic Quay.\nBrian Bannatyne, managing director of Response, said: \"Our people employed on the Sky account have delivered a great service to Sky's customers.\nWe are confident they will continue to do so.

It's only been three years, huh?\" she told Radio 1.\nHere's all you need to know about the song - and Lorde's new album.\n\"I am so proud of this song,\" wrote Lorde on Twitter. \"It's very different, and kinda unexpected. It's complex and funny and sad and joyous and it'll make you DANCE.\"\n\"It's the first chapter of a story I'm gonna tell you. The story of the last two wild, fluorescent years of my life.\n\"This is where we begin.\"\nLorde told Mistajam that Green Light was \"about me trying to figure out how to put myself back together\" after her first significant heartbreak.\nIt opens on a sombre note, as Lorde recalls the beginning (or end?) of her relationship.\n\"I do my makeup in somebody else's car,\" she sings over a minor key piano. \"We ordered different drinks at the same bar.\"\n\"Did it frighten you, how we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor?\"\nBut Lorde goes on to call her lover a \"liar\", practically spitting the line: \"Those rumours they have big teeth, they bite you.\"\nAs she ramps up towards the hook, she's getting ready to pack her belongings - while admitting she's finding it hard to finally make the break.\n\"I wish... I could just let go,\" she sings as, in the background, a chorus of cheerleaders chant: \"I'm waiting for it, that green light. I want it.\"\nThe green light is a recurring theme in F Scott Firzgerald's The Great Gatsby, signifying the elusive promise of the future. Lorde may be referring to that or, more simply, a green light giving her permission to move on with her life.\nStructurally and thematically complex, Green Light isn't as immediate as previous Lorde singles like Royals and Yellow Flicker Beat. In particular, there's an awkward gear change from the haunting, dramatic verses into the choppy, beat-driven chorus. But in common with one of the year's other great pop comebacks - Katy Perry's Chained To The Rhythm - the song rewards repeated listens.\nThe cathartic music video, directed by Grant Singer and featuring Lorde dancing in strobing green lights and on car roof-tops, helps give the song some context, too.\nLorde's spent last year working on her new album with US musician Jack Antonoff. You might know him as a member of the group .fun,  the band behind the 2011 smash We Are Young. You might also know him as the boyfriend of Girls creator Lena Dunham; as the co-writer of three songs on Taylor Swift's synthpop opus 1989 - or even through his solo project, Bleachers.\nEither way, Green Light (along with most of Lorde's new material) was recorded in his home studio in Brooklyn, as pictured in this Instagram shot.\n\"We worked out of the house for the better part of a year, in this tiny little room covered in bizarre animal wall paper,\" she said.\nFrom the teenagers who hid in the school toilets to hear the song premiere, to the fan who wrote \"this was worth the million year wait\", it's fair to characterise the reaction as \"broadly positive\".\nLast year, Lorde scolded an impatient fan who said he was \"giving up\" on the chances of hearing a follow-up to her debut album, Pure Heroine.\nSpeaking to Mistajam, she explained the extended break had been necessary.\n\"I needed to just go away, go home to New Zealand, and hang out by myself and figure out what I was going to do next. I knew I couldn't make the same thing again, and I had to figure out what it was that I wanted to say. And I'm so glad I took that time, because this record is the coolest thing I've ever made.\"\nEarlier this week, eagle-eyed fans spotted the cryptic message \"M*******A\" in the title bar of Lorde's website.\nThey guessed, correctly, that this was a hint about her album title... with possible names including Macadamia (?), Mona Lisa or Musomania (an obsession with music).\nBut she's since revealed the record will be called Melodrama.\n\"I wrote this album about this crazy year of my life,\" she explained. \"I partied a lot and I felt all the feelings - and it was all so fluorescent. So I decided to call the album Melodrama.\"\nDavid Bowie believed the Lorde was \"the future of music\", according to one of his oldest friends - which is why the singer was chosen to pay tribute to him at last year's Brit Awards.\nGoing back to the studio after that performance, she said his spirit informed he writing.\n\"I feel like the whole time spent writing this record, I've had him in my thoughts, I've had him in my heart.\n\"It's hard not to make something and not think, 'What would David think of this? If I could play it to him, what would he say?'\"\n\"This is as pop-dance as it gets,\" she told Mistajam. \"We were just in the studio, mashing around on the piano and... that's what it is.\"\n\"We didn't turn it into the single, it was just born that way.\"\nThe 20-year-old added the new album was more varied than her debut. \"There's a lot of beats again but there's also instruments that are going to surprise people.\"\nAsked if she'd be visiting Worthy Farm this June, Lorde replied: \"You know, farms are cool. I love farms. I'm a big fan of farms. So who knows?\"\nA week into Donald Trump's presidency, Lorde posted a link to the album Sweet Sexy Savage, by US R&B singer Kehlani.\n\"After a horrifying, anxiety-inducing week of news, music like this allows much needed catharsis,\" she wrote. \"I truly believe in the necessity of cathartic pop records in times like these.\n\"I love the big sprawling projects too, but there's something about the falls & lifts of meticulous pop, moments designed for u to feel what u need to, that's more important than ever.\n\"You're probably guessing what kind of record I've made based on these tweets.\"\nWe can't wait.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Understanding the structure of the leukaemia, he said, would help scientists to develop trials which would bring those drugs to the right subsets of patients.\nDr Elli Papaemmanuil, who co-authored the study, said the findings shed new light on the fundamental causes of AML.\n\"For the first time we untangled the genetic complexity seen in most AML cancer genomes into distinct evolutionary paths that lead to AML.\n\"By understanding these paths we can help develop more appropriate treatments for individual patients with AML.\"\nDr \u00c3", "summary": "One of the main types of blood cancer is not one but 11 distinct diseases, detailed genetic analysis suggests.", "id": "36479291"}, {"document": "Kneale, 32, was beaten by Russia's Vasily Mosin by three targets in the double trap final in Lonato.\nHowever, he won gold with Matt Coward-Holley and Matt French in the non-Olympic men's team discipline.\nKneale said getting to Rio \"has been tough, but to actually pull it off is amazing\".\nHe has now become the sixth member of the British shooting team to earn a spot for next year's games in Rio.\nKneale led with a score of 142 after the qualification round but Mosin scored 29 out of 30 targets in the gold medal match, with the Manx shooter getting 26 to claim silver.", "summary": "Isle of Man shooter Tim Kneale has secured qualification for the 2016 Olympics after winning silver at the Shotgun World Championships in Italy.", "id": "34260286"}, {"document": "Shares in the firm - whose brands include Sheilas' Wheels - fell more than 9% after half-year underlying pre-tax profits slid 21.3% to \u00c2\u00a346.5m.\nThe drop was in part due to profits in the firm's motor insurance business falling 80.7% to \u00c2\u00a33.3m.\nChief executive Stuart Vann said: \"The claims environment in the motor market continues to deteriorate.\"\n\"As a consequence we will seek to implement further rate increases in the second half of the year as we look to mitigate against these trends.\"\nThe group has more than 1.4 million motor insurance policies and about 570,000 in home insurance.\nA recent AA report showed car insurance premiums rose for the first time in three years during the second quarter of 2015, with the average cost of annual comprehensive car insurance up 5.2%.\nIncluding one-off items, Esure's pre-tax profits actually increased by 84.% to \u00c2\u00a3105.4m - but the firm said this was largely due to a gain from its acquisition of GoCompare.", "summary": "Online insurance firm Esure has said it will push up premiums after a surge in small injury claims.", "id": "33846338"}, {"document": "Lostprophets said they would forever be \"haunted\" by what Watkins, 36, of Pontypridd, had done but were unaware of his actions.\nIn a statement they said they \"never imagined him capable\" of such offences.\nPolice called for victims to come forward after Watkins dramatically changed his pleas in court on Tuesday.\nHe pleaded guilty to a series of offences - described as \"depraved\" in court - including attempted rape of a baby.\nSouth Wales Police officers are now investigating new leads after receiving around a dozen calls.\nThe police chief who led the inquiry said they would \"work tirelessly to identify any other victims\".\nDet Ch Insp Peter Doyle described it as \"the most shocking case I have ever seen\".\nWatkins will be sentenced on 18 December.\nThe other members of Lostprophets announced in October the band would disband amid the sex offence charges against Watkins.\nNow, in a statement on Facebook over the weekend, Jamie Oliver, Lee Gaze, Luke Johnson, Mike Lewis and Stuart Richardson said they had \"hoped it was all a mistake\".\n\"Sadly, the true extend of his appalling behaviour is now impossible to deny,\" said the statement.\n\"Many of you understandably want to know if we knew what Ian was doing.

Given the latest developments, expect it any day.\nWhy now? Quite simply, they've been told the time has come. Senior NHS officials have advised them that the health service needs to start making plans if a new contract is to be brought in this summer as planned.\nThat's because hospitals would need to carry out a detailed review of rotas and staffing before contract offers are made in May, in time for the August start date.\nBut once that has been done, the contract could be imposed quickly. Within six months about 80% of junior doctors would be on a new contract - this is because as trainees, most of them quickly rotate through jobs.\nThat's the theory anyway. But imposition is fraught with difficulties - and ministers know this. If they do impose the contract there will be a collective holding of breath in the corridors of power as they wait to see what junior doctors do next.\nThat's because the anger and determination of the profession to resist these changes has time and again taken ministers by surprise.\nThe junior doctors row explained\nWhat exactly do junior doctors do?\nHow does your job compare?\nAnalysis: Why should we care?\nSo how would the BMA react? The union has so far refused to be drawn on the issue in detail publicly.\nOne option is to carry on with strikes, which they have the mandate to do - although privately there is concern within the union that they could lose public support if they do (the latest poll by Ipsos MORI shows two-thirds back the medics).\nLegal challenges are also being discussed behind the scenes, while a mass non-signing of the contract or symbolic resignation from the NHS could take place - but if doctors subsequently turned up at work it could be argued they're effectively accepting the terms.\nThe fact is there are limited options. The NHS is effectively a monopoly employer after all.\nBut it would be a risk though to assume that doesn't mean there will be no impact on the numbers staying in the health service. Already one in two doctors who finish the foundation stage of their training - the first two years after graduating from medical school - step off the junior doctor training ladder by not going straight into speciality training.\nSome go abroad - to travel and to work - while others are tempted by opportunities in alternative sectors, including the pharmaceutical industry and (apparently) cruise liners who employ ship doctors. And Scotland and Wales would no doubt welcome some of the best English trainees into their health systems given half the chance.\nSignificant numbers are also working as locums in the NHS, in the knowledge that the demand for doctors means there is good money to be earned by working in a freelance capacity.\nOf course, many of these medics do end up returning to training. But even under the existing contract that has not been enough to fill the gaps - there are shortages in a whole host of specialities from GPs to A&E.\nIf the government does go ahead with imposition and that situation is made worse, questions will be asked in years to come whether the government did the right thing. Imposition may solve a short-term problem, but the long-term effect is unknown. The stakes could not be higher.\nRead more from Nick\nFollow Nick on Twitter", "summary": "News that junior doctors have rejected a final \"take-it-or-leave-it\" offer from the government in the contract dispute means the nuclear option - imposition - is now a real possibility.", "id": "35541962"}, {"document": "The 19-year-old, who is being held at Corby Police Station, was arrested on Tuesday by officers who are trying to locate missing Veronica Sbircea.\nVeronica left her home in Kettering on the evening of 21 July and there were sightings of her in London on 27 and 28 July.\nPolice believe she may be in either the Brixton or Enfield areas of London.\nVeronica, who is also known as Rachel, is white, 5ft (152cm), with long straight black hair and brown eyes.

Former All Blacks wing Rokocoko broke through from his own half and took his team into the red zone.\nThe ball was recycled and Warriors ran out of defenders as Imhoff went over in the corner. Carter converted but Russell opened Glasgow's account with a penalty moments later.\nIt was hard not to marvel at the home side's tempo and guile, but Glasgow soon served to remind us that they have some special players in their ranks too.\nRussell executed a planned move to perfection, holding the defence with dummy runners from either side before slipping a pass to Tommy Seymour. The Scotland wing tore through the gap and Stuart Hogg was only denied a try by some good scramble defence.\nThe attack did eventually yield another three points from the boot of Russell, but it perhaps should have been more.\nThe visitors were unrecognisable from the team that had lost three Pro12 matches on the bounce and on the half-hour they broke through.\nAgain Russell held the defensive line long enough for centre Dunbar to run a dream of a line to crash through the midfield and dive over.

Russell's conversion gave Warriors a deserved 20-7 advantage.\nThe home side, with their array of stars, seemed devoid of ideas in the face of Glasgow's ferocious defence. They kept Racing pinned back in their own territory, and as the French superstars failed to trouble the scoreboard, it was easy to forget the likes of Carter and former Glasgow totem Leone Nakarawa were on the pitch.\nRussell struck again with the boot to put further daylight between the sides at 23-7 with 14 minutes left, but Carter produced a flash of the old magic to collect an off-load and side-step his way past Hogg to stretch and touch down. He converted his own try and Glasgow had seven minutes to protect a nine-point lead.\nThey did so comfortably, safe in the knowledge they had all the tools to repel even one of Europe's finest teams.\nThey have given their Champions Cup campaign a huge shot in the arm, and if they can repeat the trick against Racing on home soil next week, they will be in a terrific position to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time.\nGlasgow head coach Gregor Townsend told BBC Scotland: \"After their first try, I thought the way we played was great.  We took them on with ball in hand and we also fronted up defensively.\n\"They have some brilliant attacking players and we knew the game would be open.

It was a huge house, with beautiful gardens and 40 fruit trees,\" Mr Fernandes says.\n\"When it all came tumbling down, it compelled me to look at the changing city. And I started drawing places that I remembered fondly while I was growing up.\"\nThe result is a collection of about 75 paintings and drawings - \"completely nostalgia driven\" - looking at the \"good old days\" in a happy, humorous way.\nHere, Mr Fernandes explains the stories behind some of his works.\nThe Bangalore Club, one of the finest examples of British architecture in the city, is still looked after well. Established in 1868 by a group of British officers, the club boasted some exclusive members, including former British prime minister Winston Churchill who still owes the club 13 rupees (20 cents; 14 pence) in unpaid bills. It is also the place where famous filmmaker David Lean filmed parts of his critically-acclaimed Passage to India.\n\"It is still looked after very well and it still has very exclusive members,\" Mr Fernandes says.\nIn the \"good old days\", people didn't have to go to barbers; they instead came to people's homes.\n\"He would ride in on a bicycle, carrying his tools in a cloth bag. A chair would be brought out and placed under a tree and the entire family - men, boys and girls - would queue up to get their hair cut.\"\nThere was one disadvantage though, Mr Fernandes says. The barber knew only one style and he would cut everyone's hair in the same fashion.\n\"My sisters would show him fashionable hairstyles from international magazines and ask for a similar cut. They would, of course, never get one.\n\"And then in the 1970s, we all started to grow our hair, hippie-style,\" says Mr Fernandes. \"The barber didn't like it one bit, he said it was bad for business.\"\nThe Coffee House on MG Road was \"the centre of our universe\", it was \"very popular\" and often frequented by journalists, Mr Fernandes says.\nThe place did - and still does - great coffee, it served dosa and omelette and was always packed at meal times.\n\"Sometimes, we would have journalists sitting on the next table and they would chat about headlines and it would be in the next day's papers. It was so thrilling.\"\nCommercial Street was the centre of shopping in Bangalore - it's a place where one could buy anything, from clothes to jewellery to household stuff to footwear. It also had toyshops and many tailors.\n\"My mother would drive me and all my nine siblings there once a year at Christmas to buy us clothes,\" says Mr Fernandes. \"She would buy the same bale of cloth, take us to the tailor who would take our measurements, and all of us would get identical clothes.\"\nThe Cubbon Park police station is a \"very beautiful\" building. It was an old British house that was converted into a police station in 1910 and it is still \"pretty much the same\".\n\"In the 60s and 70s, Bangalore was a very laid back place and there was no real crime, occasionally maybe a cycle would be stolen,\" Mr Fernandes says.\n\"I was in school then and my friends and I would cycle around the city and the policemen looked so silly in their flowerpot hats, so we would tap them and run away. But once I got caught and was detained in the room you see on top here. I was let out only after my mother came to the police station and apologised,\" he remembers.\nThis house in this illustration is the cartoonist's ancestral home and the girl was one of his sisters.\n\"She was very pretty and young boys would come by to greet her. A protective uncle would be hovering nearby, scowling, with an airgun, trying to scare away the boys,\" Mr Fernandes says.\nJust below the British Council in Bangalore was the very popular Koshy's bar and restaurant. It is still hugely popular, so much so that even the state's chief ministers come here for a coffee or a drink. During a visit to the city in the 1980s, Britain's Prince Charles dropped by for a cup of coffee.\n\"This very picturesque railway line crossing is barely half a kilometre from my present home,\" Mr Fernandes says.\nIn the 1960s and 70s, a daily train from Madras (now Chennai) to Bangalore used to pass through the area and the gates would shut for 10 minutes.\n\"Whenever we were at the gate, we would wave at the passengers, and they would wave back at us.\"\nThe Brigade Road was Bangalore's \"most iconic hangout\" place in the 70s - all the city's fashionable people would go there in the evenings for fun.\nAn Indian-American couple set up a restaurant there and introduced Bangaloreans to apple pie and waffles, there were a couple of pinball machines and musically-inclined people would hang out with their guitars; and there was a coffin-maker nearby.\n\"In those days, we used to say you come to Brigade Road for recreation, sustenance and death. Unfortunately, it's all gone now, replaced by a huge mall,\" says Mr Fernandes.\nThe cartoonist's \"sprawling home ground\" was filled with trees, birds and dogs and this artwork shows a corner of that house.\n\"It was customary for gentlemen in the house to have a good lunch and a siesta in the gardens. It was a man's domain - by some unwritten rule a lady would never sit out there. I was told it was considered not dignified for a lady to sit there.\"\nThe Plaza was the iconic cinema hall where the finest Hollywood movies were shown.\n\"My favourite story of the theatre is when an aunt went there with her family to watch Gone With The Wind.

Mark Wood, playing his first ODI since September after ankle surgery, bowled Stirling before David Willey trapped Joyce lbw.\nFrom that platform, the home side spun the game decisively in their favour, with Rashid the star turn.\nThat was his first five-for in ODIs and the second-best figures by an English spinner in the format, behind only the 5-20 taken by Vic Marks against New Zealand in Wellington in 1984.\nCombining superbly with fellow Yorkshire player and spinner Root (2-9), Rashid demonstrated control and variation to bamboozle Ireland, who lost their last eight wickets for just 45 runs.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe greatest moment in Ireland's cricket history came at the expense of England in the group stages at the 2011 World Cup, when Kevin O'Brien's heroics helped them knock off 327 with five balls to spare.\nOff the pitch, Irish cricket has improved significantly in the past six years - as they continue their pursuit of Test status - but on the pitch they remain reliant on the players who helped them achieve that victory in Bangalore.\nSeven of the team that played in that win - including the same top six - also featured at Bristol, serving as a reminder of how far they have to go before they can graduate from an associate nation.\nThey had their moments - most notably Stirling's early blitz and the bowling of Peter Chase, who took all three of the England wickets to fall.\nBut they were ultimately outclassed by an England side who are a very different animal to two years ago, let alone six.\nThe chase was a formality, taking on the feel of a practice match at times, with Hales nonchalantly striking 10 fours during an innings that was ended by a catch from Porterfield, and Root cruising during his unbeaten 49.\nMorgan will have been disappointed to score just 10 against his native country before he was caught by Kevin O'Brien, but will be pleased with his side's display.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nEngland captain Eoin Morgan, speaking on Test Match Special: \"Putting in a clinical performance is as good as we can ask for as a side.

Ali took 5-57 and Ben Stokes an influential 2-13 as the hosts lost their final nine wickets in 22 overs.\nEngland, 1-0 up in the two-Test series, lost three quick wickets to spin and were 50-3 when rain ended play early.\nBangladesh got within 23 runs of their 286 target in the magnificent first Test in Chittagong, but their afternoon batting display equals the second-worst collapse by a team who had already scored in excess of 170 for the loss of only one wicket.\nHaving taken 20 balls to get off the mark, the normally aggressive Tamim needed only 40 more to reach fifty, before bringing up three figures in 139 deliveries for his eighth Test century.\nThe 27-year-old left-hander was quick to seize upon anything short and carved some loose deliveries from Chris Woakes to hit three boundaries in an over.\nHis footwork was also extremely nimble and he advanced down the wicket to strike two more fours in the next, the first in Test cricket by debutant slow left-armer Zafar Ansari.\nSuch was England's desperation to dismiss him they wasted an lbw review with a Moeen delivery that appeared to be clearly bouncing over.\nWhen the umpire's finger was finally raised, to a leg-side catch behind that even bowler Stokes was unimpressed with, the opener's immediate review showed the ball had brushed his shirt.\nHaving played such a variety of attacking shots it was a surprise when he padded up to Moeen - a dismissal which precipitated Bangladesh's collapse.\nThe bowlers had appeared bereft of ideas when Tamim and Mominul were in full flow during Bangladesh's highest second-wicket partnership against England.\nSpin was once again unable to control the batsmen, and in 14 overs in the morning session, the three slow bowlers could not produce a maiden, conceding eight boundaries in the process.\nAnsari's first six overs cost 36 and contained four full tosses, prompting some unkind comparisons with Lancashire's Simon Kerrigan, who conceded 28 in the first two overs of his debut in the 2013 Ashes series.\nBut as at Chittagong, Stokes inspired a resurgence with a spell of 2-7 in six overs.\nHe bowled with accuracy, caused doubt in the minds of the batsmen with movement outside the off-stump and struck Mushfiqur with a hostile bouncer that clearly unsettled the skipper.\nJust one ball after that incident, a still shaken Mushfiqur tickled a tame catch to Alastair Cook at leg slip.\nMoeen had bowled six modest overs for 23 without a hint of success before lunch, but with Stokes tying up the batsmen from the other end, the off-spinner produced a spell of 4-20 in 10 overs.\nEngland lost their first three wickets for less than 30 in both innings of a Test for the first time against an Asian team in the last match, and yielded scarcely more this time.\nThe hosts, having selected only one seamer, opened with spin from both ends in the form of 18-year off-spinner Mehedi, who took seven wickets on his debut in Chittagong, and slow left-armer Shakib Al Hasan.\nBen Duckett took an aggressive approach to his third Test innings, launching Shakib over long-on for six in the second over, but was caught down the leg-side three balls later.\nCaptain Alastair Cook became Mehedi's second wicket, having originally been given not out.\nBangladesh's review confirmed the ball hit him in line on the back foot and umpire Kumar Dharmasena had to overturn his third decision of the day.\nGary Ballance departed to his third successive single figure score, bringing Moeen back out to the middle to join the reliable Joe Root.\nOn a pitch offering plenty of assistance to the bowlers, England are once again left to rely on their all-rounders in the middle order.\nEngland all-rounder Moeen Ali, who took 5-57, told BBC Sport: \"Stokesy bowled fantastically well. I think with the reversing ball he's becoming one of the best all-rounders in the world. He was bowling tight, I was bowling tight.\n\"For me, I was just trying to bowl maidens to stay on.
