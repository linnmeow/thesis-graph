As well as aiding scientists, the machine was copied by cake maker Lyons to create the Leo - which was one of the first widely-used business computers.\nThe original machine used 3,000 valves arranged in a series of racks to crunch numbers, and fills a floor space 20 square metres large.\nThe machine is being re-built in public at TNMOC and today saw the official opening of the Edsac exhibit and the switch on of the machine's \"clock\" that will keep all of Edsac's parts working in harmony. Other computational units of the machine will be added and switched on as work progresses.\nOne element that will not be duplicated in the modern replica is the system Edsac used as its memory store.\nThe original used long tubes of mercury to hold data but modern-day health and safety rules do not permit these to be used in the museum. Instead, the recreators are using a memory system based on nickel that was used in many machines that came after Edsac.\nThe work on the recreated Edsac is due to be finished in late 2015. Once finished, TNMOC said children visiting the museum will be able to write programs to run on the venerable machine.\nThe project began in 2011 and initially its 20-strong team of volunteers only had photographs of the original to work from.\nHowever, in June this year plans of the original were discovered that are now being used to check and guide the work of the Edsac rebuild team.",

Well, perhaps more than you think.\nWhile medical science has revolutionised the treatments available, the same cannot be said for where the care is given. Hospitals - and the district general hospital in particular - still dominate.\nThere is, it seems, a fear of change.\nIt is a point not lost on NHS England's Prof Keith Willett. He is the national director of acute care and is leading the review of how services are organised in the NHS.\nHe says the comparison with the telecommunications industry is an interesting one. He believes society as a whole is too \"conservative\" when it comes to embracing change to the NHS.\nHe believes we remain too fixated on the \"bricks and mortar\" than what works best. To illustrate the point, NHS England has released figures today showing that since the reorganisation of trauma care into regional networks in 2012, 600 lives have been saved.\nThe analysis - by the Trauma Audit and Research Network - has calculated that survival rates have increased by 30% for the 16,000 patients brought to hospital each year with major trauma from road accidents, falls and assaults.\nBut this is not a success story.\nThe case for changing the way trauma care was organised - it is now centred around 25 major hospitals - was put as long ago as 1988 by a report for the Royal College of Surgeons, by Sir Miles Irving.\nNHS England calculates 6,000 lives could have been saved by introducing the reform earlier.\nSo why did it take so long? Many theories have been put forward over the years from politicians being too quick to put their names to campaigns to save local hospitals to NHS leaders - both doctors and managers - being too timid to put the case for change.\nRecently, there has been some confusion over the direction the NHS is heading.\nMuch was made of the comments by Simon Stevens, the new chief executive of NHS England, about the role smaller hospitals have to play.\nSome interpreted this as rejection of the desire for these specialist centres.\nBut the case being made today - Mr Stevens is making a speech to an Age UK conference in London when he will reference the data on trauma care - will make it clear.\nBigger when it comes to specialist care from stroke services to heart surgery is definitely better.\nThat is not to say there isn't a role for smaller hospitals, there is.\nEven after the trauma care reorganisation, district general hospitals are still responsible for rehabilitation and carry out follow up appointments. But as the phone industry has shown, embracing change holds the key to progress.",

So what have we learned from the four biggest tournaments that define the men's game in 2017?\nThe US regained the Ryder Cup last autumn and Europe must be relieved the next match is not this September. There is frightening strength in depth in the American game as Koepka, Spieth and now Thomas have proved.\nThey all trail Dustin Johnson in the world rankings, the world number one's major season having been ruined by the injury he sustained in a freak fall on the eve of the Masters.\nMatt Kuchar was runner-up to Spieth at The Open, Rickie Fowler's fifth place at Quail Hollow was his second top five of the year in a major and Patrick Reed was joint runner-up in the US PGA.\nFurthermore, there is a unique chemistry and camaraderie among this generation of American players. Thomas and Fowler were waiting to congratulate Spieth at Royal Birkdale and The Open champion was among those who returned the compliment in Charlotte last Sunday.\n\"We obviously all want to win,\" Thomas said. \"We want to beat the other person - but if we can't win, we at least want to enjoy it with our friends.\n\"I think that we'll all be able to enjoy this together and I know it's going to make them more hungry, just like it did me, for Jordan [at The Open].\"\nAs BBC Radio 5 live's Jay Townsend told listeners: \"He basically threw away the whole year. If you are not fit, you can't compete.\"\nThe strength in depth at the top of the game means that even with Rory McIlroy's incredible talent, he cannot keep up with the biggest names unless he is able to practise without physical hindrance.\nThe 28-year-old Northern Irishman shared fourth at The Open - his best major performance of the year - but he was never genuinely in contention at Birkdale and, after finishing 22nd at Quail Hollow, he revealed he suffers back spasms following most rounds he plays.\nIt means his time on the range has to be curtailed and he has still not fully recovered from the rib problem that has blighted his year.\nNow is the time to take a break. There is no Ryder Cup and he has the opportunity to fully recover before embarking on a vital season next year.\nThe four-time major champion has not won one for three years, but given the freak ankle injury of 2015 and his current problems he has rarely been properly fit in that period.\nJustin Rose was second to Garcia at the Masters and Tommy Fleetwood came fourth at the US Open, but otherwise there was little to excite UK golf fans.\nRose never recovered from the disappointment of his play-off loss to the popular Spaniard, while Fleetwood looks the best prospect to kick on after his experience at Erin Hills.\nDanny Willett, the 2016 Masters champion, has suffered a horrible year with a collapse of form and fitness. Like McIlroy he needs to take himself out of the firing line, heal his back and find a way to fulfil huge potential.\nThe generation of Tyrrell Hatton, Chris Wood, Andy Sullivan and Matthew Fitzpatrick remain a class below their American counterparts on major championship layouts. They have to find a way of competing on the biggest stages.\nJordan Smith made a hugely impressive major debut with his 9th-place finish at Quail Hollow, fresh from his European Open triumph at the end of last month.\nErin Hills, which staged the US Open, was a step too far - indeed hundreds of steps too far. When courses are stretched to 7,800 yards to cope with the vast distance the modern golf ball travels, we know that something needs to be done.\nPrivately, there are leading officials who acknowledge change is required. One very highly placed American official told me: \"Golf is the only sport where we expand the field of play to accommodate changes in the game.\"\nSuch length adversely affects the time it takes to play rounds and makes golf an out-and-out power game that compromises the need for guile and skill. The sport has become too one-dimensional and set-ups can often be too penal to keep scores in check.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis was the year when the golfing gods finally relented at a men's major and allowed a 62 to be carded. Branden Grace's brilliant score was compiled on a rain-softened Royal Birkdale course set up for low scoring.\nIt led to a thrilling day, with vast crowds delighting in birdies and eagles aplenty. That Saturday in Southport was a day when the world's best could show us their full range of skills.\nBut those who were not on their game still struggled. McIlroy blew a brilliant start to that third day and this may well have been the round that made up his mind to part ways with caddie JP Fitzgerald.\nFor me, the abiding memory of this year's majors were provided by the Birkdale crowds.

The level of the fine reflects this.\"\nIn a separate move, the treasurer of No2EU Yes to Democracy, Mary Bryce, has been fined \u00a33,750 for non-compliance.\nThe now defunct party was set up by Bob Crow's RMT union, with backing from the Communist Party of Britain among others, to fight the 2009 European elections on an anti-EU, pro-workers rights platform.\nIt de-registered in 2010 when activists drifted away but was brought back for the 2014 European elections, when it fielded 46 candidates, including Mr Crow, who died of a heart attack two months before polling day.\nThe party was wound up again in October 2014 - but its treasurer failed to deliver a spending report for the 2014 election, despite appearing to \"spend a substantial sum\" and delivered donations and loans reports late, the Electoral Commission said.\nThe commission said it had chosen to fine the treasurer rather than the party because of the lack of co-operation specifically by the treasurer.\nAn initial fine of \u00a33,000 has been increased to \u00a33,750 and will go up to \u00a34,500 if the fine is not paid by 31 March, it added.\nLouise Edwards, Head of Regulatory Compliance and Casework at the Electoral Commission, said: \"Transparency around party spending does not become less important because a party ceases to be registered.\n\"It remains the treasurer's legal responsibility to ensure all required reports have been delivered to the Commission.\n\"Despite our efforts, NO2EU's spending almost two years ago at the European Parliament Elections still remains unknown as a result of this lack of co-operation.\"",

Payment processors would be ordered not to handle fees for premium services - such as higher definition or longer clips - from UK citizens to unregistered sites.\n\"We're a very substantial market and to access the money that's flowing from the UK would be quite a powerful incentive to introduce restrictions,\" Atvod's chief executive, Pete Johnson told the BBC.\nThe UK government has already pressured the UK's major internet service providers to use software filters that automatically block adult material unless households specifically ask for them to be turned off.\nHowever, a spokesman for the coalition government indicated it needed time to consider Atvod's request.\n\"We will continue to work with industry and others to look at where further action could be taken, including around age restrictions,\" he said.\nLabour has, however, already come out in support of the move.\n\"It is only by threatening to cut off the flow of money that we will force these websites to act responsibly, and payment processors need legal clarity before they can act to help achieve this,\" said shadow culture minister, Helen Goodman.\nHowever, Sex and Censorship - which describes itself as a free speech campaign group - said the move would prove ineffective.\n\"It won't make any difference to the sites that give all their videos away for free and sell advertising because they don't need credit card processing,\" said Jerry Barnett.\n\"And some sites are already accepting bitcoin and other anonymous online payment systems. A clampdown on card payments would just accelerate this trend.\n\"Even if implemented, this measure would have no effect on the range of content available to British consumers.\"\nMr Barnett previously ran a UK-based adult website himself until he was fined for failing to prevent children accessing its content.\nMindgeek, the Luxembourg-based operator of many of the most popular adult sites, said it already carried out age verification checks in countries where this was required. But it indicated this did not address the crux of the problem.\n\"There is no single 'silver bullet' solution to protecting children and adolescents from potentially harmful content and interactions in their digital lives,\" said a spokeswoman.\n\"The best solution lies in a multi-layered approach in which the parent assumes the central role.\"\nAtvod acknowledged its proposal was only part of the solution, but it insisted that the scheme could still be designed to make a difference.\n\"The material that appears on the free services is placed there by the paid services to attract customers to sign up to subscriptions.\n\"As long as the paid service placed content on a free service without age verification it would be in breach of its licensing conditions and so would not be able to access funds from the UK.\n\"We're not saying this will stop all children seeing all pornography online.\n\"But our argument is that even if you reduce the number of children who are accessing hardcore pornography online by 10%, that would be a significant win.\"",

Utah Senator Mike Lee said the Republican Party had to find another candidate or it would not win the White House.\n\"We've got candidates who can do it. There's still time to do it, but we have to actually do it,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press.\nMr Trump, who gave a video apology over the 2005 recording, has said there is \"zero chance I'll quit\".\nAnd most Republican voters would appear to support his stance.

Mr Ryan disinvited Mr Trump to attend the event after the tape revelations.\nFarage says Trump 'alpha male boasting'\nIn his video apology, Mr Trump gave a hint that he would bring up more lurid allegations in Sunday's debate saying: \"Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary Clinton has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.\"\nMr Giuliani, former New York mayor, told US media that Mr Trump would not hesitate to describe Mr Clinton's abuse in criminal terms.\n\"The reality is that... this is a situation in which neither side should throw stones because both sides have sinned,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press.\nHillary Clinton's camp has not responded to the allegations, but her campaign chairman John Podesta called Mr Trump \"disgusting\" when asked for his response to the tape revelations. \"This is who this guy is,\" he said.\nAnd it could be risky for Mr Trump to refer to Bill Clinton's infidelities. According to the New York Times, polling suggests a majority of voters are not interested in revisiting stories about Mr Clinton's behaviour.\nAllegations of marital infidelity first surfaced when Bill Clinton ran for the White House in 1992. The Clintons went on national television to declare their love for each other, though they did not directly deny the claims of an alleged affair by nightclub singer Gennifer Flowers.\nMr Clinton was a popular president who won a second term in 1996. But his last years in office were beset by scandal and a Senate impeachment trial, after it emerged he had lied under oath about an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\nRumours of other infidelities, and of Hillary Clinton's aggressive response to the women accusers, have dogged the couple ever since, including the allegations Mr Trump is tweeting about.\nThe tape recording of Mr Trump dates back to 2005 when he was appearing as a guest on a soap opera.\nIn it he says, \"you can do anything\" to women \"when you're a star\" and is heard saying \"grab them by the pussy\".\nThe recording, posted by the Washington Post, overshadowed the release of transcripts of Mrs Clinton's speeches to private events, by the whistle-blowing site Wikileaks.\nFurther revelations of Mr Trump's language about women emerged on Saturday, when recordings of his conversations with controversial radio talk show host Howard Stern came to light.\nIn one 2006 conversation, he discusses his daughter Ivanka's body and tells Mr Stern it is okay to call her \"a piece of ass\".\nMr Trump's third wife Melania - whom he married a few months before the 2005 recording and who was pregnant at the time - has called his comments \"unacceptable and offensive\". However, she said she had accepted his apology.\nFormer Republican presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have joined the growing list of Republican politicians who have deserted him.\nSome Republicans say they will \"write in\" Mike Pence, Mr Trump's vice-presidential running mate, on the ballot sheet instead as a symbolic show of opposition to his candidacy.\nWho is ahead in the polls?\n48%\nHillary Clinton\n44%\nDonald Trump\nLast updated October 10, 2016",

She didn't seem at all excited.\"\nAfter her long journey, the only thing Ms Earhart wanted was a telephone to tell her husband she had landed safely.\nWhile she was heading to call her husband, Mrs Gallagher said she went to cook her a meal and it turned out to be a good decision.\n\"She said she hadn't had anything but tomato juice since she'd left America,\" she said.\n\"We asked her to stay with us until she was ready to go on again, and she said she would so long as we didn't mind her clothes - she had nothing but what she stood up in.\n\"In fact she had literally no luggage of any kind with her whatever, and no money either - but my husband was able to fix that.\"\nLooking back on that afternoon, Mrs Gallagher said she \"thoroughly enjoyed having our very unexpected guest\".\n\"I can still hear her nice matter-of-fact voice saying about her flight, as though it had been rather a long motor drive on a cold day.\"\nIn the same year that Mrs Gallagher gave her eyewitness account of her encounter with Ms Earhart, the aviator became the first person to fly solo across the Pacific Ocean from Honolulu to Oakland, California.\nIn 1937, she set herself the challenge of being the first woman to fly around the world.\nThis challenge, however, would prove too great and she disappeared after taking off from Lae New Guinea, bound for Howland Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\nA rescue attempt lasted 17 days and scoured more than 250,000 square miles of ocean, but she was never found.\nThe aviator remains a household name in the US, and an airport in her home state of Kansas was named in her honour.\nIn March 2012, a similar bid to rename City of Derry Airport after her was rejected when local politicians could not agree.\nTime of Our Lives is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster and Radio Foyle at 14:03 BST on Sunday",

We have been living for one year together here in Khartoum.\"\nI ask her if she could be mistaken but she is adamant that is not the case.\n\"It's definitely my brother, I have been looking for him for two weeks. He is not a human trafficker, he is my brother.\n\"He doesn't do anything about smuggling. He doesn't know anything about that.\"\nSeghen says that after she was told her brother Medhanie had been arrested, she tried to talk to the police in Sudan.\n\"I called the police but they said there is no person with that name. I have been searching for him for two weeks. They told me there is nobody with that name in prison. Then, all of sudden, I see him in Italy.\n\"I have been worried sick.  I have been crying the whole two weeks. I did not know if he was alive or dead.\"\nMered Medhanie is alleged by Italian authorities to be a smuggling kingpin who trafficked thousands of people from Libya to Italy and northern Europe.\nNicknamed \"The General\" his operations have been linked to the deaths of hundreds of refugees and migrants who drowned off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa.\nBut Seghen says that her brother came to Sudan in March 2015 illegally as a refugee after fleeing Eritrea by travelling through Ethiopia. He was hoping to join another sister living in the US and to study and work there.\nOfficials have said the arrest was made on 24 May in Khartoum but it was only announced on Wednesday when an extradition to Italy was completed.\nSeghen does not know what happened in the two weeks that he was held.\n\"I am worried,\" she said. \"I have been worried if they interrogate him or hit him or abuse him mentally.\"\nHer voice chokes with tears as she talks about seeing the images of him being led off the plane in handcuffs.\n\"His photo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he looks awful. I feel sad to see him like that.\"\nItalian authorities have said they still believe they have the right man. The British National Crime Agency has said it is too early to speculate on the claims that the wrong man has been arrested.\nBut a growing number of people have been saying that's exactly what happened.\nThe first to do so was Meron Estefanos - an Eritrean human rights activist and radio host based in Sweden. She has interviewed the real Mered Medhanie a number of times.\n\"I've received over 400 Facebook messages from people that know the person that's arrested, everyone is saying this is my friend, my childhood friend, he's just a refugee,\" she said.\nShe also said she had spoken to refugees who had met the real Mered Medhanie. All said the man arrested did not resemble him.\nSeghen, for her part, is angry with the police.\n\"They should be investigating before they arrest him. The photos are different too,\" she says.\n\"The Sudanese police didn't inform me. They should be asking him if he has anybody to contact in Khartoum.\n\"[But] They didn't question him. If they questioned him he would've said my sister is here, my relatives and friends are here. We would've known where he was for two  weeks.\n\"They wouldn't have taken him without knowing if he is innocent.\"\nShe appealed to British police to investigate whether the wrong man had been extradited.\n\"He is not a human trafficker, he is an innocent refugee,\" she insisted.\nAnother sister living in Norway, Hiwet Tesfarmariam Berhe Kidane, said she was hoping to be able to visit the man she believes is her brother.\n\"I am looking for the exact place he's being held so I can stand by his side. I want to go to my brother, to Italy,\" she said.",

There have been sit-ins and a vote on the mascot is being held this week.\nVirginia Hassell is supporting a student campaign to end the use of the Lord Jeffery mascot.\nShe says the mascot's associations are \"racist and offensive\" and it is not how the university should be represented and it shouldn't be appearing on clothing associated with the college.\nAs campuses become more diverse in their intake, she says there is going to be more scrutiny of such symbols.\nThe dispute at Amherst comes amidst a wave of protests and arguments over race and identity in US universities.\nMs Hassell, who has been in talks with college authorities, says she is confident that the mascot will be changed, but not as quickly as campaigners might want.\n\"I'm feeling optimistic about the direction we're heading in right now. The conversation has shifted from, 'Are we going to change the mascot?' to 'What are we going to change it to?'\"\nAnd there are students opposed to losing the Lord Jeff mascot.\nThomas Sommers says he is sensitive to the concerns about Lord Amherst's \"atrocious\" behaviour, but he doesn't associate the mascot with the 18th Century general.\n\"Personally, the way I see it is that the mascot is just an embodiment of Amherst College. It's a mascot and nothing more.\n\"Like the name of the college or the town of Amherst, when I think about the name I don't think about Lord Jeffery Amherst. And when I think about the mascot I don't think about the historical figure.\"\nBoth his parents went to Amherst and he says changing the mascot would mean losing a tradition that links present and past students.\nAny decision on scrapping the mascot should take into account the views of such alumni, he says.\nThe college remains non-committal: \"There are understandably mixed views about changing it,\" says a statement.\nAnd it says that \"people at Amherst will continue to think about the issues in all their complexity\".\nThe college's board of trustees is expected to examine the issue early next year.\nBut both Thomas Sommers and Virginia Hassell, on either side of the argument, believe a change is ultimately likely.\nIt's part of a wider pattern of controversies over emblems and the legacy of universities' links with the past. Should universities change symbols to reflect changed attitudes? Or should they keep them in place and accept that in the past people had views which now seem repellent?\nAt Harvard Law School there is a growing campaign to change the school's seal, which includes the family crest of an 18th Century donor Isaac Royall.\nThe wealth that allowed him to leave land to Harvard was drawn from being a particularly brutal slave-owner and slave-dealer who, it's claimed, burned slaves to death in reprisal for a revolt.\nOpponents have argued that altering the emblem would only be a cosmetic change and wouldn't address the issue of how or whether an institution should be held accountable for its past.\nBut the campaigners argue that the school should rid itself of such visible associations with slavery and have adopted the slogan Royall Must Fall.\nThe slogan links the campaign to the Rhodes Must Fall student protest in South Africa, which earlier this year saw a colonial-era statue of Cecil Rhodes being attacked and ultimately removed from the University of Cape Town.\nThe statue, which had been on the campus since the 1930s, became the focus of student protesters who saw it as a surviving symbol of an era of discrimination against the black majority.\nAcademic and social commentator Frank Furedi says there is a \"powerful impulse\" on US campuses at the moment to question \"traditional conventions, rituals and symbols\".\nHe says it is part of the \"ascendancy of identity politics\" on campus, where politics are based around issues such as race, gender, religion or sexuality.\nWith such an approach to politics, he says, students are seeking symbolic ways to assert their identity.\n\"Consequently anything can become an object of protest.\n\"Increasingly identity in the present is being affirmed through insisting on the erasure of the traditions of the past.\"\nProf Furedi predicts: \"There is little doubt that this trend will intensify.\"",

Other major users of solar power including Italy (19.7GW) and Spain (6.7GW) are expected to face challenges too.\nIt says the main challenge will be balancing the network in real time without causing blackouts or overloads.\nThe UK won't see a solar eclipse on this scale until 2026.\nHow to watch the eclipse safely\nWhy don't we see an eclipse every month?\nSolar power overall provides some 1.5% of the UK's total annual power output.\nBut Leonie Greene of the Solar Trade Association believes the eclipse should not be a cause for concern.\n\"At this time of year, in the morning, the impact of the eclipse on solar output will be particularly small,\" she says.\n\"The impact of the eclipse on solar will be known by grid managers and it will pose no problem to the power supply.\n\"Far more challenging is the surge in power demand after the eclipse as everyone goes indoors for a cup of tea.\"",

We don't know the best person to approach and we end up going round in circles between different ministries.\n\"To protect the island and adapt to climate change we need to put in sea defences - but we only get enough money to go from one consultancy to the next.\"\nThe territories had previously received support for environment-focused programmes from the aid department DFID. But they said that ministers have now switched interest towards traditional job creation - even though the islanders said their economic future depends on a healthy environment.\nBrexit is a major concern, as many of the territories have received substantial funding from the EU.\nThe minister from from Pitcairn, Michelle Christian, said: \"We can apply for EU funding for environmental issues such as soil erosion, waste management and water, so we are concerned about the future.\"\nGibraltar's minister John Cortes, a professional ecologist, said he was nervous at the possibility of Spanish encroachment on protected marine zones after the UK has left the EU.\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said the government was already working to improve cross-departmental policies on the territories.\nShe pointed to the internationally-acclaimed programme of marine protection around some key territories. The zone around Pitcain, for instance, will protect an area of ocean three and a half times the size of Britain.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"Climate change and energy work is a network-wide priority. The Foreign Office works closely in partnership with departments across Whitehall on the international climate change agenda.\"\nThe government's delegate had been forced to withdraw from the meeting in Alderney because of the election.\nThe meeting's organisers said the government had declined to foot the bill for the meeting, which was funded by Alderney in conjunction with voluntary groups.\nThey applauded the government's marine programme, but said many of the most critical environmental issues were on land.\nTheir best hope is that when Brexit is settled, the UK will devote more of its time and energy to them, rather than less.\nFollow Roger on Twitter.",

He says he welcomes a public debate on this issue.\nThe academy is also calling for closer collaboration between the NHS, academia and the pharmaceutical industry in finding new drugs.

I was going to say 3-2, but I actually think it will be a 2-2 draw.\nMatch preview\nLeicester remain on course for the title after taking 10 points from a possible 12 in some awkward fixtures in the past few weeks.\nNorwich, West Brom, Watford and Newcastle look easy on paper but they aren't, especially at this stage of the season.\nI don't see the Foxes winning all their remaining games, however, and I just have a sneaking suspicion they will have a little hiccup here.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCrystal Palace remain on an awful run in the league but I watched them against Reading in the FA Cup last weekend and I think they can cause Leicester some problems.\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\nCram's prediction: Being a Sunderland fan I am not sure Palace are safe yet and would love them to be dragged into the relegation battle.  I want Leicester to win the title and my heart and my head says 0-2.\nMatch preview\nWatford are heading to Wembley after beating Arsenal in their FA Cup quarter-final, and they are also very close to securing top-flight safety.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt is easy to forget this is the Hornets' first year in the Premier League because they have never really looked like being in danger of the drop.\nStoke were typically impossible to predict last weekend, and saw their good run ended with a home defeat by Southampton, so I am not sure what to expect from them this time.\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\nCram's prediction: Is this a candidate for last game on Match of the Day? Probably. 0-0\nMatch preview\nNorwich got a great point against Manchester City last weekend but, in their situation, they need to win games.\nI don't see the Canaries getting anything out of West Brom and they will be watching Sunday's north-east derby because a win for either Newcastle or Sunderland would see them move away from Norwich at the bottom of the table.\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\nCram's prediction: Norwich are in desperate trouble at the bottom of the table. West Brom are playing quite well at the moment and my uncle Bobby Cram used to play for them in the 1960s so I have always been a pseudo Baggies fan. 2-1\nMatch preview\nIf Swansea do not beat Aston Villa, then I would be seriously worried about them, especially because of what the three points will do for their survival prospects.\nThe trapdoor has opened a little more for Villa after their defeat by Tottenham, while Swansea will know they can move a big step closer to safety by winning this one.\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\nCram's prediction: Maybe Villa will start to play now they are pretty much down. 0-1\nMatch preview\nSunderland have had the upper hand in this fixture for a few seasons now but I already saw some improvement from Newcastle in Rafa Benitez's first game in charge, Monday's defeat by Leicester.\nI cannot tip Newcastle to win, though, because I don't think their players have the correct mindset.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf they cannot motivate themselves to play when their team is facing the drop, then they will have the same problem with a game against Sunderland.\nLawro's prediction: 1-1\nCram's prediction: What do I say? Six derby wins in a row for Sunderland and I would love to see a seventh, but each time I have been left thinking we can't win another one.  That is kind of what I am thinking this time but my heart obviously wants us to win it - and, if we do get a goal, I don't care if it comes in the 93rd minute. 0-1, hopefully.\nMatch preview\nLiverpool thrashed Southampton 6-1 at St Mary's in the Capital One Cup in December, but I don't see a repeat of that on Sunday.\nIt does not help Jurgen Klopp's side that they played Manchester United at Old Trafford on Thursday, because that will take a lot out of them even though I expect them to win the tie.\nSouthampton are inconsistent, but they got a really good win at Stoke last week, and it would not surprise me to see them produce a really strong finish to the season.\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\nCram's prediction: Saints will make sure they won't leak as many goals this time. 3-2\nMatch preview\nI have nothing but sympathy for Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany because his latest calf injury must have left him wondering what on earth can he do to get it sorted.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt has happened so many times to him, he has got an inherent weakness and I am seriously concerned about his career.\nThe injury that forced Nicolas Otamendi off against Dynamo Kiev looked a lot less serious - a dislocated shoelace, I think. On behalf of the centre-halves' union, I was embarrassed for him.\nCity will be lying in wait for Manchester United, though, because Louis van Gaal's side have to deal with their Europa League tie with Liverpool on Thursday night.\nThe likes of Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva are big-game players for City and I would expect them to make the difference.\nLawro's prediction: 2-0\nCram's prediction: City are in a better place at the moment and I think it will be a fairly comfortable day for them. 2-0\nMatch preview\nBournemouth's past four games have seen them take 10 points out of a possible 12 but I see their good run ending on Sunday.\nThe Cherries will go at Tottenham but I think that will suit Mauricio Pochettino's side, who are focused on their title bid.\nLawro's prediction: 2-1\nCram's prediction: Bournemouth are safe so can relax, so I can see a few goals in this one. 3-2\nMatch preview\nLawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n*Does not include score for postponed games\nLawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)\nLawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)",

He's improved lots in the past couple of years, but he can't speak in sentences. Rob finds it difficult to explain what's wrong and that can make him get frustrated and upset.\nWhen we were growing up I didn't see much of a difference, I went to a local primary school and Rob went to a special needs school. But as I got older that changed, I started to realise his needs were more important than mine and it made me grow up very quickly.\nOne evening when I was about 8 and Rob was 9, he decided he wanted to go outside. It was the middle of the night - but he jumped up, ran to the front door and straight across the road to the allotment. My parents ran after him and were really upset. Rob has no idea about the dangers of the road, doesn't know where he's going and he can't tell you what he's doing. After that Dad brought a massive chain for the door and my parents started locking the living room and kitchen door when we were downstairs, so Rob couldn't go out again.\nGoing to the shops with Rob used to be strange. We'd get odd looks and some people would giggle. Rob used to scream if he saw something he didn't like and put his fingers in his ears when things were too loud. I used to be really embarrassed about the things he did, I found it hard to explain to my friends, I never knew what to say. But if someone said something horrible to Rob I was the first one to stick up for him.\nHaving an autistic brother growing up, meant that in summer holidays I went with him to a camp with kids who had physical and learning disabilities. I quickly understood that people have different strengths and just because you struggle with one thing, doesn't mean you won't be brilliant at something else.\nAt home it can still sometimes be hard if Rob has a bad day. He slams doors, won't sleep and makes really loud noises. But I know it's only because he's unhappy and I try to be understanding. But I always worry about my parents having to deal with that.\nIn one way Rob thinks of me as his little sister. He doesn't listen to me when I ask him to do something, always takes my favourite seat on the sofa just to mess with me and his worst big-bro habit is farting when I sit closely to him (I hate that). On the other hand, I know he'll never be able to live by himself or go to work, so I will always have to look out for him.\nI love my brother with all my heart, and I'm proud to be his sister. But I'd be lying if I didn't say I find it hard sometimes.\nWhat is autism? Read our guide\nWatch My Autism and Me - A Newsround special",

The street was like a raging river.\n\"We got some possessions upstairs and about half an hour later the water started to come in.\"\nThe shop and house were flooded to a depth of about a foot which Lindsay thought initially would drain away and dry out quite quickly.  She was wrong.\n\"I didn't honestly think it was going to be as bad as what it was,\" she said.\n\"I thought we'd clean up and it would be business as normal.  But when the loss adjustor came out he said we could be closed for six months.\"\nHe was almost spot-on.\nThe business eventually reopened in July after operating out of temporary accommodation in the village hall as Lindsay kept locals supplied with vital provisions.\nThe shop has been revamped and the tearoom part expanded. A roaring open fire adds to the warmth of the welcome and bright Christmas decorations are a sign of optimism that this year's festivities won't be cut short.\nRecovery, however, has taken its toll.\n\"People struggle to sleep and every time it rains you're on edge,\" said Lindsay. \"You're constantly going to the window and checking the street to see if it's flooding.  It's not a nice feeling.\n\"You see it all the time on the news and you just don't understand the impact until it happens to you. Words can't explain how it feels.\"\nOn the same day that Carsphairn was hit, 20 miles to the south west the River Cree burst its banks in Newton Stewart causing the town's worst flood in half a century.  The water reached shops in Victoria Street, including the outdoor clothing store owned by Ross Cunningham.\nHe was having a bad winter, with two other shops flooded in similar circumstances in Cumbria. But it enabled him to compare the authorities' responses north and south of the border.\n\"In Cumbria, after an initial slow response, they got on to it very quickly and things have been happening,\" he said.\n\"In Dumfries and Galloway a lot of people, myself included, have been pushing for things to happen including repairing the river wall before winter, which has only just been completed.\"\nMr Cunningham said he had also encountered different attitudes to dredging, which he raised with the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon when she visited Newton Stewart in the aftermath of the flood.\n\"Myself and many other people in the town have been pushing them to dredge the Cree which I think definitely needs doing but it seems to be that's not going to happen,\" he said.\n\"Over the border in Cumbria there's been a lot of dredging going on and I can't quite understand why it can happen only, as the crow flies, 70 miles away but on this side of the border it can't happen for some reason.\"\nDumfries and Galloway Council has just finished rebuilding the river wall where it was washed away a year ago.\nIt has also removed the Sparling footbridge which cleared the Cree only by a few feet and effectively acted as a dam, trapping vegetation and debris washed downstream when the river was in spate.\nBut more permanent flood prevention measures are still some years away, and that is a concern for many.\nThe Belted Galloway Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and Visitor Centre is one of the closest premises to the river and owner Craig Andrews is worried that it might be hit again.\nHe finds himself constantly monitoring the river level every time there is heavy rain.\n\"There is supposedly money available for a flood defence for us, but we are not really any further forward,\" he said.\n\"We have built some flood defences round our own place, hopefully to try to mitigate the risk, but we really just have to keep our fingers crossed.\"\nAnd that is what communities all across the region hit by Storm Frank will be doing this festive season: watching weather forecasts with concern, and praying that this new year is a lot better than last.",

But that doesn't suit everyone.\nWhen 67-year-old Akio Kouyama was asked by a former colleague to join his human resources company, he was very keen.\n\"The first year after retirement was fun. You travel and enjoy your hobby but after that, you start to wonder if it is ok not to use your skills in the workforce,\" he says.\nThe human resources company that he joined is exclusively for retirees who are eager to work.\nIt has over 750 registered members whose average age is 69 with the oldest being 81 years old. They can choose from over 30 assignments such as being receptionists or personal drivers.\nThe company is called Koreisha which translates to \"the elderly\" in Japanese.\n\"Our founder was told that the solution to Japan's shrinking working population lies in elderly, women, foreigners or robots. So he started a firm which can help Japan utilise its silver talent,\" says Mr Kouyama who has since taken over the top job at Koreisha.\nJapan's workforce is shrinking fast.\nWhen Koreisha was founded in 2000, the proportion of Japan's population above the retirement age was 17.4%.\nIn February 2016, that statistic has jumped to 26.9% and is expected to rise to 36.1% by 2040.\nSpending on healthcare and pensions already accounts for one-third of the country's annual budget and it is ballooning fast.\nKoreisha's founder, the septuagenarian, Kenji Ueda, has cheekily referred to retirees as \"industrial waste\" who should be recycled, rather than getting under their wives' feet at home.\n\"At our age, we don't want to work full time, so most of our members only work two to three days a week,\" says Mr Kouyama.\nFor 68-year-old Rikizo Takano, his office for twice a week is a rooftop garden in central Tokyo with a magnificent view which includes the Tokyo Tower and the rainbow bridge. At first sight, his job of tending to a client's garden looks almost like a hobby.\n\"Before retirement, I used to work on factory constructions so I am a certified landscape engineer. I know what kind of soil should be used for a rooftop garden and it is nice to be able to use my skills again,\" he said.\nMr Takano and other Koreisha members don't get paid a lot of money. On average they receive an hourly income of 800 (\u00c2\u00a35; $7) to 1,000 Japanese yen which is roughly what students earn by working at a restaurant.\nBut low pay is not necessarily a problem.\n\"As long as you don't work over 30 hours a week, or earn more than 400,000 yen (\u00c2\u00a32,497; $3,528) a month, it doesn't affect pensions,\" says Koreisha's Mr Kouyama.\n\"It is great pocket money that they can use to spoil their grandchildren,\" he adds.\nBut Japan is traditionally a Confucian society and the norm would be for older workers to earn not only more money but also more respect in the workplace. That has been a challenge for some of those returning to work in more junior roles.\n\"We educate ourselves that if we want to rejoin the workforce, we have to do so as newly hired employees. We need to be humble. Young people may learn from us by watching how hard we work, but not because we stand on our dignity,\" says Mr Kouyama.\nHierarchy, however, is deeply entrenched in the Japanese society.\nSo when 75-year-old Masatoshi Tsuneno created a group to help the local community in Kashiwa city, he made it a rule among the group, that they would never mention or discuss their previous occupation and job titles. The group has over 100 members, and they call themselves 'a community of multi-generation interaction'.\nWhen I asked him what he used to do - even off the record - he still wouldn't say, adding that it is important for his peers to be able to treat each other equally, even if someone was formerly a chief executive or diplomat.\nWhat Mr Tsuneno's group does in Kashiwa is not high-powered.\nThey supervise school crossings for example - lollipop men or ladies as they're known in the UK - to make sure the children in the neighbourhood get to school safely. They open the library outside school hours to help children study before and after classes. They also volunteer their time at a day-care facility, and the female members would visit new mothers, to check in and make sure they are settling in well with their newborns at home.\nThey can be considered as 'stand-ins' for parents, or grandparents even. That's because for many of the residents in Kashiwa, their own extended family do not live in the same neighbourhood. And this interaction between the generations is exactly what the government wants more communities to do across Japan.\nMr Tsuneno says the positive impact can be seen through the lower crime rates, as well as the growing number of young families settling in the area.\n\"It's nice to hear some children who were very shy several years ago greet us properly in the morning,\" he says, \"but it's also great for us to be able to do some good for the community instead of just doing nothing at home.\"\nWhatever his past position, however senior it may or may not have been, his new role is clearly giving him a keen pride, and a sense of being of service to his community, something he may not have got from sitting at home in his slippers.",

        "source_text": "The result had begun to seem beyond doubt as judge Theodor Meron analysed the failings of his colleagues in The Hague tribunal's trial chamber - but there was still drama and tension.\nFinally, in the equivalent of stoppage time, he confirmed what one news agency called \"a rare victory for Serbs\" at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\nMomcilo Perisic, the man who led Yugoslavia's army in the mid-1990s, would be acquitted on all charges and released.\nHis convictions - for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity in Sarajevo and Srebrenica - and his 27-year prison sentence were overturned.\nThe former general responded with nothing more than a twitch of his left eye. But his compatriots may feel entitled to be somewhat less restrained.\nRecent verdicts at the ICTY have left many Serbs with the impression that the tribunal delivers nothing more than victor's justice - jailing Serb defendants while allowing crimes against Serbs to go unpunished.\nJust three months ago the same appeal chamber, chaired by the same judge, sparked outrage in Serbia when it quashed the conviction of two Croatian generals, Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac.\nThey had previously been found guilty of deliberately targeting civilians during the offensive known as Operation Storm in 1995.\nHundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled Croatia en masse. Many are still without permanent homes or jobs and have been unable to recover the property they left behind.\nThe appeal chamber's verdict left them without justice as no-one else has been convicted of crimes against Croatia's Serb minority.\nThe retrial of Kosovo's former Prime Minister, Ramush Haradinaj, brought another acquittal last November.\nWith a prosecution case riddled with holes, the verdict came as no surprise. But it left Kosovo Serbs in a similar position to their Croatian counterparts.\nJust two weeks later, the ICTY found a Bosnian Serb commander, Zdravko Tolimir, guilty of genocide for his part in the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.\nThis was justice for the thousands of victims, but coming so soon after the other two verdicts it reinforced the feeling among many Serbs that the tribunal was weighted against them.\nBut the Perisic verdict may help to restore faith in the neutrality of the special court. Serbian human rights activist Natasa Kandic told the BBC that it was an important judgement for all Serbs.\n\"They will see the ICTY is not just trying to prove that Serbs are criminals. They will say the ICTY has proved that Serbia does not have state responsibility for the atrocities in Sarajevo and Srebrenica,\" she said.\nBut Ms Kandic still has concerns about the way in which the verdict was presented.\n\"The judgement didn't mention the victims. We need additional instruments to gain justice for the victims. This judgement doesn't mention them - 8,000 dead people - where is the justice for them?\"\nCampaigners like Ms Kandic see this as the real failing of the ICTY. For all its aims of providing international-standard justice to the people of the former Yugoslavia, it has provided precious little in the way of reconciliation.\nFrom a Serbian point of view, the Perisic verdict adds credibility to the tribunal's other decisions, which have put many ethnic Serbs in jail. But long-term reconciliation in the region may require more than just a judicial process.",

        "source_text": "The letters are brief, though they do come with a help sheet, and will no doubt raise a lot of questions in recipients' minds.\nWhat follows will, hopefully, answer most of those questions.\nWhat is it all about?\nThe government has decided to withdraw child benefit (CB) from high-income households.\nHowever, rather than actually cancel the payments, it is imposing a tax charge to claw back some or all of the benefit received.\nThis new High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) starts from 7 January 2013.\nAn HMRC tool can help most combinations of households decide if they are caught by the new charge.\nIncome above \u00a350,000 means paying a charge of 1% of the CB for every \u00a3100 of income above that \u00a350,000 base level.\nSo if your income is \u00a357,000 your tax charge equals 70% of the CB received.\nThose with income of \u00a360,000 or more will face a tax charge equal to the whole of their household's CB.\nI have got a letter - what do I have to do?\nFirst, in the immortal words of Corporal Jones, \"don't panic\".\nThe letter is not a tax demand, nor does it require an immediate response.\nBut those who get one of the letters (and, indeed, some who do not) need to think about their situation and may need to take action before 7 January 2013.\nDo bear in mind that the worst that can happen is that the tax bill claws back all of your CB. It can never exceed the CB received.\nWho is getting a letter?\nHMRC is sending letters to people it thinks:\nIf this really is not your situation - you do not get CB, or you and your partner each have income below \u00a350,000, then you can ignore the letter.\nThere is one small group of people who may not be caught by the HMRC's mail-shot but could be liable for tax.\nSuppose you are a parent, a single mother for instance, and you give some of your child benefit to the child's grandparents because they look after your child while you go out to work?\nIf one of the grandparents happens to earn more than \u00a350,000 a year, then the fact that they are receiving some of your child benefit will trigger a tax bill for them.\nWhat counts as income?\nIncome here is \"adjusted net income\" - all taxable income for the tax year in question. The \"net\" is because pension contributions and payments to charities can be deducted.\nIncome includes salary, taxable benefits-in-kind such as a company car, net-rental income, and gross-interest income.\nThere is a calculator on the new gov.uk website to help you.\nQ&A: Child benefit changes\nWho counts as a partner?\nThis includes a husband, wife or civil partner unless you are separated in a way that is expected to be permanent.\nHowever, the term also includes someone with whom you are living as if they are your husband, wife or civil partner - which, inevitably, is going to cause some uncertainties.\nThe point is that the HICBC attaches to the higher earner of the couple.\nSo for many married couples caught by the HICBC, that will mean the wife receiving CB, but the husband receiving a tax bill to claw back some or all of the CB.\nIt will undoubtedly be the case that, for some people, their positions will change during a year.\nThe amount of the HICBC is calculated by reference to the period the couple were together.\nI think I am liable - what are my choices?\nAs HMRC's letter says, you can choose whether to:\nThis is really something that partners need to decide jointly.\nThose who believe they are definitely going to lose all their CB may decide to stop getting the CB in the first place.\nThe person receiving CB needs to fill in the online form at www.hmrc.gov.uk/stopchbpayments or call the CB helpline on 0845 302 1444.\nThose who are not sure what their income will be, or who think their income will be in the \u00a350-60,000 bracket, or of course those whose income is below the threshold, will probably decide to keep receiving CB.\nIt makes sense to monitor the position during the year and consider putting a bit of money aside if there is going to be a charge.\nDo I have to tell HMRC I might be liable for HICBC?\nYes. If you do not normally fill in a self-assessment tax return, you will need to tell HMRC by completing form SA1 - see www.hmrc.gov.uk/sa1 - by 6 October after the end of the tax year.\nHow do I pay HICBC?\nIn principle HICBC will be due for payment at the same time as self-assessment liabilities.\nSo, the first charges, for CB for the three months 7 January - 5 April 2013, will be due for payment by 31 January 2014.\nIf you do not want to pay the HICBC in a lump sum, you can choose to pay the charge through PAYE codes.\nSo the underpayment for 2012-13, and your ongoing in-year liability, could be collected through your tax code in 2014-15.\nWhat if I make the wrong choice?\nThere is no penalty for keeping receiving CB if you (or your partner) have a high income.\nYou just need to tell HMRC so they can levy the HICBC. And you can stop the CB payments at any time.\nMore importantly, some people will stop the payments and then find their income does not reach the \u00a360,000 level after all, or they split up with a partner who had the high income.\nIn this case they can reinstate the CB payments.\nSuch reinstatement can be made retrospective for up to two years.\nBear in mind that if your income was the lower one but still over \u00a350,000, you will have to pay a tax charge too.\nMy partner and I do not talk about finances. How do I find out our position?\nIt will be possible to get some information from HMRC.\nIt will be able to say if your partner gets CB; also, based on the information it holds, whether your partner's income is higher than yours.\nI did not get a letter - am I still potentially liable for HICBC?\nYes. The same principles apply as set out above.\nHMRC cannot guarantee to contact all affected people, particularly where relationships are changing.\nIt has a lot of useful information at www.hmrc.gov.uk/childbenefitcharge.\nIt also offers a helpline on 0845 302 1444.\nThe opinions expressed are those of the author and are not held by the BBC unless specifically stated.

        "source_text": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe 73-year-old, who guided England to three Test series wins against Australia, believes their \"exciting\" crop of young players are the key.\nBrearley, captain in 31 Tests from 1977-81, said Alastair Cook is \"decent, straightforward and honest\", but added: \"I'm not sure how much flair he has.\n\"Can you win the Ashes without that flair? No.\"\nHe added: \"One of the exciting things is the flair in the young players from number five to number eight - Joe Root is a terrific player, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali.\"\nBy winning in 1977 and 1978-79, Brearley was the last skipper to lead England to home and away Ashes success until Andrew Strauss, more than 30 years later.\nHis most famous win came when he returned to the captaincy part way through the 1981 series, leading his country to a 3-1 victory over Australia.\nAs the 2015 series approaches, Brearley has been talking to Michael Vaughan - an Ashes-winning captain in 2005 - about the challenges facing Cook's side, and the demands of leading your country.\nAfter losing 5-0 down under in 2013-14, England are seeking to regain the Ashes this summer, but Brearley feels they may struggle.\nHe said: \"Australia are a very tough team. On paper, they're a better team than us. They've certainly got better bowling than we have.\n\"But we're playing at our home grounds, which makes a difference. If we can get that spirit going, and people play to their best, then we've got a chance.\"\nEngland's Test captain Cook was replaced as one-day skipper by Eoin Morgan last December, and left out of their World Cup squad earlier this year.\n\"There's an advantage for Alastair Cook in not having played in the World Cup and the recent one-day matches,\" Brearley said.\n\"He's been able get away, reorganise, remind himself of his technique and come back fresh.\n\"But it will be difficult for him if things don't go well to start with - and if he doesn't feel he's got the same spirit that the team have had in the one-day matches recently, and if he doesn't quite feel in charge.\"\nBrearley sees Cook as one of England's quieter captains - but does not view that as a problem.\nHe said: \"Alastair Cook is not a big extrovert. He's not somebody who is going to change things in dramatic ways.\n\"Tony Greig [Brearley's predecessor as England captain from 1975-77] was a bit like that. He was a 6ft 5in blond-haired South African, who made big gestures, who reacted to the crowd, who said things to the opposition, who stirred up Dennis Lillee.\n\"I don't think you have to be like that. One of the important things as captain is that you have to be yourself.\n\"I think Alastair Cook is a leader who is conscientious, he works at it, he's fair-minded to the players.\"\nHe currently averages 54.11 after 27 Tests and Root's performances at number five have impressed Brearley to the point that he feels the 24-year-old Yorkshireman could lead his country in future - if he is not pushed too soon.\n\"I think he'd manage it, but I think he might be helped if it doesn't come too soon,\" Brearley said. \"Let him get a few more thousand runs in a very few years for England at number five or possibly number four.\n\"If you were going to do it, it would have to be on the basis that, if it failed, don't keep him on too long - get him back to being what he's best at.\n\"But he's lively. I think he'd do a good job.\"\nAsked by Vaughan to define his perfect captain, Brearley said: \"There isn't one. There are all sorts of styles. The perfect captain does it his own way, but is open to ideas as to how to change, always.\n\"You've got to be able to get on with the team. That doesn't mean being matey with them all the time, because you've got to say tough things to people, that they don't want to hear.\n\"So you want someone who is pretty strong in themselves, and has a sense of humour, can see things that they do wrong, and is passionately involved.\"\nBrearley captained both Middlesex and England, but had interests outside cricket too, working as a philosophy lecturer at Newcastle University in the late 1960s and forging a post-playing career as a psychoanalyst.\n\"Captaincy is about about talking to people, listening to people,\" he said.\n\"People used to say I was cerebral, and maybe I was to a fault. But I was also quite passionate. I minded.\n\"Sometimes that showed in good ways. Sometimes it showed in not so good ways. But people knew that I cared.\"\nData analysis is now common across the sporting world, but Brearley's self-confessed academic approach to the sport drove him to look for advantages in facts and figures as far back as his first days as Middlesex captain in the early 1970s.\nHe said: \"The tactical side originally came from my father. I was extremely interested in tactics, sometimes to a fault. It became a bit academic.\n\"For example, in my first year of captaining Middlesex, I'd look through Wisden to see who batsmen had got out to against us in the previous year's match. I think that was completely stupid.\n\"I was using data to that extent, but perhaps misguidedly. It can go right or wrong, can't it?\"\nBrearley, who captained England in 31 of his 39 Test matches, was renowned for his man-management skills, with Sir Ian Botham declaring him \"the best captain I ever played under\".\n\"I wanted a team with 11 people who were potentially captains, who were thinking like captains about the whole game, and about other people's games as well as their own,\" Brearley said.\n\"That makes life a bit more difficult. You get arguments, you get debates, people have opinions. Sometimes you get fed up with them, and you don't want to hear another opinion, especially if it's different from yours. But to get a team together, I think that's vital, actually.\"\nOpening batsman Geoffrey Boycott - who captained England in four Tests in 1978 when Brearley was injured - developed a reputation for high self-confidence that masked insecurity, according to Brearley.\nHe said: \"Someone such as Geoffrey Boycott - a very fine, great player - needed encouragement and reassurance. More than you might imagine, especially if he wasn't doing so well.\n\"He'd want to know, for example, that the ball that had just got him out would have got WG Grace, Donald Bradman and all the rest of them out too - that he hadn't done anything wrong.\n\"But he also wanted to be reminded that he had to go his own way, and be positive in defence as well as occasionally in attack.\"\nWhile all-rounder Botham is regularly cited as the key figure in England's 1981 Ashes series victory over Australia, fast bowler Bob Willis played a major part - particularly as the third Test was won at Headingley, taking 8-43 as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings.\nYet he almost did not make the side, having struggled for form in the lead-up to the match.\nBrearley said: \"He wasn't very fit. He had a chest infection. He had a bit of trouble with bits of his body. He was getting on a little bit, in terms of age, as a fast bowler, and he started to bowl no-balls.\n\"We nearly left him out of that Headingley Test when he took 8-43. Amazing, isn't it?\n\"He hadn't played in a match the week before for Warwickshire. We didn't select him for the team. Luckily, he found out and said: 'What do you mean, I'm not fit? I'm perfectly fit. I was just having a match off to be fit for the next match.' It was as close as that.\"\n\"Captaincy is people skills,\" Brearley said. \"It's about finding out what makes people tick, what motivates them.\n\"People such as Ian Botham were good when you geed them up. I'd get someone such as Peter Willey at mid-on or mid-off, and I'd say: 'Stir him up.'\n\"Peter would sneer at Botham and snarl at him. He'd say: 'You're bowling like an old woman.' Botham would come in and bowl with a bit more energy, which was good.\n\"But if you did that with Bob Willis, he might be more unconfident. I realised that after a while.\"\nBotham, who played 102 Tests from 1977-92, was involved in a number of controversies during his playing career, but Brearley said he had few problems with the all-rounder.\n\"Ian Botham, when I had him at the beginning of his Test career, was pretty easy to manage,\" Brearley said.\n\"He was so talented. He was so extroverted and confident. He had his anxieties, but he was confident once he got on to the field.\n\"He was so attacking in terms of his mentality - and that was almost always right for him. Just occasionally, you needed to quieten him down.\"\nKevin Pietersen was effectively sacked by England shortly after their 5-0 Ashes defeat in Australia in 2013-14, amid suggestions of dressing room disharmony.\nBrearley wondered if the situation could have been handled better by his fellow senior players, saying: \"One thing I've wondered about the England team is this: Might they, as a team, have done more to confront Kevin? To enlist him but also confront him - and not let him get away with any nonsense.\n\"I'm not saying that Geoffrey Boycott was that difficult a player to handle, but the rest of the team knew him very well by the time I played with him in Test matches, and weren't going to let him get to that awkward hectoring state of mind that he can get in to.\"\nListen to a podcast of Michael Vaughan's full interview with Mike Brearley on the BBC Radio 5 live website",

I must try and pull myself together.\"\nThe prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust.\nScreenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer.\nHe took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison.\nBFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was \"deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation\".\nSir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as \"a great joy\", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings.\nHe has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels.\nDepp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his \"great honour\" to present the award to \"a very great man\", saying he had been \"fascinated and inspired\" by him.\n\"He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true,\" he said.\n\"But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend.\n\"A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!\"\nSir Christopher responded by saying: \"I can't thank you enough,\" in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere.\nHe went on : \"When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me.\n\"And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!\"\nHe said of Depp: \"He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star.\n\"Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream.  I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him.\"\nThe festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore.\nThe Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s.\nThe film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the \"disturbing film\" raised \"larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse\".\nThe film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney.\nHanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing \"Uncle Walt\" on screen.\n\"Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day,\" the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock.\n\"But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell.\n\"It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene.\"\nIn a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having \"a bigger-than-life persona\".\n\"I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery,\" he explained.\n\"You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind.\n\"I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian,\" he continued. \"And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor.\n\"I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy.\"\nHanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October.

Family members said he never mentioned the watch he had left in the hands of a stranger.\nAmong those to come forward in response to the museum's appeal for information were his granddaughter Cath Muir and nephew Dr Ernie Worrall, who did not know each other.\nMs Muir said: \"What a surprise it was when by husband told me there was an appeal for information on my grandfather. I remember him as a child. He was very badly burned when the Athenia was attacked and had many skin grafts on his face and legs. He told us that they were his maps of the world.\n\"After returning from Galway he was pensioned out of the Merchant Navy due to the injuries he sustained, but he returned to sea to serve in the war, he felt it was his duty to do so, but that meant he had to forgo part of his pension.  After the war he worked as a hospital porter in Law Hospital, Lanarkshire.\n\"I am indebted to Gerry for keeping my grandfather's watch safe all these years and I look forward to bringing my own grandchildren to Riverside to see it on display soon.\"\nThe seaman's nephew, Dr Worrall, added: \"I was made aware of Riverside's search for my uncle Sid. My father had told me all about him being caught up in the torpedoing of the Athenia.\n\"A day or so after the sinking, my grandmother's neighbour was at the cinema and saw on the Pathe newsreel that night my uncle being landed as a survivor in Galway. At the end of the picture show she told my grandmother, who at that point would have been unaware whether her son had been killed or had been rescued.\n\"My grandmother hot-footed it down to the cinema just as the manager was closing up for the night and he kindly opened up and re-ran the newsreel for her while she sat in this empty cinema and was able to be reassured that he was indeed alive.\"\nHe added: \"Not only has Emily's detective work allowed me to learn more about my family's history, it has put me in touch with Cath and family I didn't know before.\"\nRob Hutchinson, who gifted the watch to the Riverside, said: \"I am delighted that the museum has been able to draw together the two ends of this very long story.\n\"I look forward to one day seeing the museum's display and possibly meeting Sid's family. My father would have been so pleased.\"\nThe watch will go on display as part of an updated SS Athenia exhibition at the Riverside which is expected to open in summer 2017.\nCurator Emily Malcolm said: \"It is wonderful to welcome Cath and Ernie to Riverside, to show them Sid's watch and to introduce them to Rob in Canada. I am so pleased they got in touch.\n\"We are delighted the family is happy to help Glasgow Museums complete Sid's story and put the watch on display.

        "source_text": "Like many simple questions, the answer is not so straightforward.\nThere is no denying that there is nothing to celebrate in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) figures and much to cause real concern.\nFor the first time since the tests began in 2000, Scotland was merely ranked as \"average\" in all three categories measured - reading, maths and science.\nOnce Scotland was classed as \"above average\" in all three.\nFor an advanced country which considers education to be a source of pride to be ranked like this should be a cause for concern.\nThe fact things would seem to be going the wrong way after a radical change - the introduction of Curriculum for Excellence and the shake up to qualifications - should make that concern greater.\nThe idea that Scotland's education system was once the envy of the world owes much to folklore.\nThere is no simple, objective way of saying how the quality of Scottish education in, say, the 1950s or 1980s compared to education in other parts of the UK or other advanced western countries.\nImportant as the Pisa figures are, they are not a definitive measure either and some consider them flawed. Most importantly they do not measure what the young people go on to do with their education.\nIt is interesting to reflect on how the day-to-day experiences of teenagers in schools today may compare with that of their parents.\nUntil the 1980s, the start of third year was a watershed moment for students.\nThe academically able usually began studying for eight O Grades. The presumption was they would then go on to study for four or five Highers in fifth year.\nThe most able would then spend sixth year studying for more Highers, improving the grades in subjects they did not do so well in or studying for a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies to help ease their path to university.\nBut for the less able the path was different.\nA youngster who was not able to study for eight O Grades would fill their timetable with \"non certificate\" courses.\nAfter the school leaving age was raised from 15 to 16 in the mid 70s, less able youngsters were faced with spending two years at school with little to show at the end. In some cases, this may have added to the risk of indiscipline as well as sheer boredom.\nThis concern led to the creation of Standard Grades -  every youngster would get a Standard Grade for completing a course so S3 and S4 would no longer be a waste of time for the less academic. What mattered was the level of the achievement.\nThat ethos has been carried over into the new qualifications system. S4, S5 and S6 now form the \"senior phase\". The overwhelming majority of teenagers stay on until S6.  S5 and S6 are no longer the preserve of the academically able. The emphasis is on what qualifications a youngster leaves school with - not what they have got at a particular stage.\nAt its best, this should mean all youngsters leave school with something of value. It would be unusual to leave with little or nothing - something which was widespread until the 1980s.\nIf a teenager is not in education, work or training now there is usually a back-story to explain this.  At the other end of the spectrum, exam passes are at a record level and so is the number of young people at university.\nIn a more general sense, the ethos in many secondary schools has also changed. There is now much more of a concern for the development of the student as a person - how to nurture a successful, confident individual. Personal development was, on occasion, overlooked in secondary schools in the past with the focus more narrowly on academic performance.\nThe overall condition of school buildings is better than it was in the 1970s or 80s too.\nWhile there are important issues concerning the quality of the construction of some new school buildings - for example in Edinburgh - at a superficial level the school estate across Scotland is in a better condition. Schools are more likely to be attractive, welcoming environments.\nAnd industrial relations are better too. For all the very real concerns of teachers' unions - for example over workload associated with the new qualifications - the relationship between unions, the Scottish government and councils is generally respectful, friendly and constructive.\nCompare that to the disruption caused by long-running teachers' disputes in the mid 70s and mid 80s.\nAnd yet, and yet.\nAnother may be whether the good intent behind Curriculum for Excellence meant teachers were pulled in too many different directions and overlooked basics like numeracy and literacy - recently issued guidance re-emphasises their importance so no teacher can be left in doubt.\nQuestions over budgets and drops over the years in teacher numbers come to the fore as well. (While the number of teachers has fallen in recent years, councils now have to maintain the ratio of staff to students so cannot simply close posts or choose not to fill them.)\nMeanwhile some parents remain to be convinced that the changes to qualifications have been for the better. If nothing else, if a youngster can only study for six qualifications in S4 (increasingly becoming the normal practice) it inevitably leads to a drop in the numbers studying some individual subjects.\nThe Pisa figures are not the last word but should provoke fresh debate on the Scottish school system. Why are these figures going the wrong way? Is the problem money? Poverty? Implementation? Guidance to teachers? About how schools are governed? Or more fundamental?\nBut they do not tell us anything about outcomes or the experience of young people.\nSo is the school system worse than it was? As a teenager might say on Facebook: \"It's complicated...\"",

Where are these 2,000 people going to come from?\"\n\"They are likely to come from savings made in combat troops. I think that's a mistake.\n\"I think the British forces have already been cut far too much in a very uncertain and increasingly dangerous world.\nHe acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said \"it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere.\"\nThe creation of the new unit is part of a major restructuring of the military under the Army 2020 plan, which will see the military scaled down to around 82,000 regular troops in the next five years.\nThe unit will also seek \"new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts\".\nThe Army spokesman said it would share the \"spirit of innovation\" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945.\nChindits was the name given to the Long Range Penetration (LRP) groups that operated in the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines, targeting Japanese communications.\nThe new unit will also use the old Chindit insignia of a Chinthe, a mythical Burmese creature which is half-lion and half-dragon.\nTony Redding from Kent, whose father was in the Chindits, told the BBC he was disappointed by the move. He said: \"Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way.\n\"I've tried very hard to look for similarities and the only common denominator I can find is that the Chindits 70 years ago were a highly unconventional force. Perhaps this new force are to use some unconventional means of warfare.\"\nBy BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale\nThe Army says it's learnt valuable lessons from Afghanistan - not least that it can't win wars using pure military force alone.\nThe brigade will be made up of warriors who don't just carry weapons, but who are also skilled in using social media such as Twitter and Facebook, and the dark arts of \"psyops\" - psychological operations.\nThey will try to influence local populations and change behaviour through what the Army calls traditional and unconventional means.\nCivilians with the right skills will work alongside regular troops and reservists and could be sent anywhere in the world to help win hearts and minds.\nIt can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election.\nPaul Rogers, a professor of international security at the University of Bradford, said the announcement represented a \"big expansion\" of the Army's psychological operations and was an \"attempt to rebrand and update\" this area of its work.\n\"We had so much difficulty in Iraq and Afghanistan, it's about trying to learn the lessons of how these groups are using social media,\" Prof Rogers explained.\nHe added: \"In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards.\n\"We've seen with Islamic State, its incredible capability on the net, Facebook, Instagram and all the rest.\"\nA former Army officer involved in psychological operations in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq, Simon Bergman, predicted it would help build \"the Army for the future\".\n\"For example, 77 brigade have a large component of civil affairs soldiers who'll be operating in populations, working with them, achieving military effects - and a broader effect, because as we know from Afghanistan, the military doesn't work in isolation. It works as a component of government.\"",

He will be sentenced in the new year.\nIt was the first prosecution to use legislation that allows British citizens to be tried for sex offences committed abroad against children if it is also an offence in that country.\nBefore the trial, Harris also admitted six offences of indecent assault against three boys aged between 13 and 14, when he was a teacher at Shebbear College, Devon in the 1980s.\nDet Ch Insp Damian Barratt, of West Mercia Police, said Harris used his work to exploit some of the most vulnerable children on the planet.\n\"He was a predatory sex offender who, over a number of years, groomed and exploited children and those around him in order to perpetrate his abuse,\" he said.\nHarris had faced 23 charges in total, including 18 allegations relating to assaults.\nThe offences in Kenya were committed while Harris was running a gap year charity he set up in the East African country, in the 1990s.\nDuring his trial prosecutors said he lured homeless boys to his home, known locally as \"The Green House\", by offering them food and shelter.\nThe court heard he would drive into Gilgil and encourage them to get into his Land Rover, with food and money.\nOne man who claimed he had been raped by Harris as a child, committed suicide shortly after giving evidence.\nMichael Kamondia was among several boys to testify across a live video link from Kenya but died on 7 December, days before the jury retired to consider its verdicts.\nThe abuse came to light when a Channel 4 documentary team making a film about the plight of Gilgil's street children was given information about his activities.\nThe offences at Shebbear College in Devon, where Harris taught Latin, all happened between 1982 and 1989.\nCurrent head teacher Simon Weale said the school acted promptly at the time to report the allegations to police after the victims made complaints.\nHarris was suspended and left \"during the course of the investigations\", the college said.\n\"Even though these offences took place more than 25 years ago, we utterly deplore these crimes and our overwhelming sympathies are with Harris' victims,\" said Mr Weale.\nIt also emerged during the trial Harris had spent 15 months in a British jail for possession of indecent images of children following a 2009 conviction.\nHe had originally faced 22 charges relating to assaults in Kenya, but Judge Philip Parker QC told jurors four had been removed from the indictment mid-trial.\nThe case was nearly thrown out after Channel 4 published a news item wrongly stating he had already been convicted, only hours after jurors began deliberating.\nJudge Philip Parker QC said he regarded the broadcaster's mistake as \"beyond unfortunate\".\nThe matter has been referred to the Attorney General to consider possible action under contempt of court procedures.",

He said: \"The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.\"\nAs one of the most powerful voices in Trump's ear, clearly Bannon's view that the media should be subject to ferocious scrutiny now holds considerable sway in the White House.\nI have decided to call this notion that it is the job of government to hold the press to account The Spicer Doctrine. Here are five thoughts about it:\nOne: Totalitarian states use propaganda to control public information, spread fear and rally support against external foes.\nDonald Trump has a powerful democratic mandate: he is no totalitarian.\nBut he seems immensely frustrated at his inability to control public information - so much so that he uses Twitter to circumvent the media, and sent out his spokesman to lambast and threaten journalists.\nPresident Trump and Mr Spicer will soon find out that, especially in the digital age, they have no hope of controlling public information.\nThe internet is a mad bazaar.\nThere will always be stuff that annoy this administration and send them into a fury.\nSo expect more individual journalists to suffer the fate of the Time magazine journalist who got his facts wrong.\nTwo: There is a serious question of credibility and trust at stake here.\nAs promised, I won't pass judgement here on the veracity of the statements Mr Spicer is making.\nBut in just his first week as president, Mr Trump has obliterated the basic faith that many Americans had that what the White House says is true.\nYou might argue that this faith was decimated by the Iraq War.\nIt had, however, been rebuilt since.\nAnd the issue isn't whether anyone believes Mr Spicer when he says Mr Trump's inauguration was better attended than Barack Obama's.\nThe problem will arise when he says something more substantial about a terror threat or America's next war.\nWho will believe him then?\nDoes it matter if the press corps, who relay his message to millions of Americans, think he's not credible?\nThree: The traditional media is caterwauling about Mr Trump's fondness for exaggeration.\nDo his supporters care? Possibly not.\nThe fact is, with Fox News and various internet outlets supporting his cause, Mr Trump believes that the nationalist media who so helped him to win the presidency are also on board now.\nInterestingly, as a president he seems to have made little effort to unify the country: instead, he seems intent on energising his base.\nAnd that base cares less and less for the - as they see it - pompous bloviating of coastal correspondents and editors.\nFour: While journalists at that same traditional media are outraged by The Spicer Doctrine, seeing it as an affront to natural justice, their colleagues in the commercial department are delighted.\nFrankly, Mr Trump's relationship with the traditional media, while hateful, is a marriage of convenience.\nSubscriptions to the Hillary-Clinton-endorsing New York Times have rocketed.\nRatings at CNN are up.\nTraffic at Buzzfeed is soaring.\nIt turns out that the \"two way\" process Mr Spicer mentioned is a case of you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.\nThis is a theme I shall be returning to.\nFive: In one sense, democratic governments have always tried to regulate the media while paying lip service to media freedom and plurality.\nAfter all, government designs the laws under which media operate.\nBut government is too hard, too complicated, and too relentless to accommodate a war against traditional media outlets.\nJust as opponents of torture argue that co-operation is the better route to good intelligence, so a constructive and open relationship between government and media is better for both, so long as there is honesty about conflicting interests.\nRight now, The Spicer Doctrine is a useful way of energising the roughly half of Americans who backed Mr Trump.\nSoon enough, it could be bad for democracy, by wasting government time, preventing proper scrutiny, and filling cyberspace with sound and fury that signify nothing - of which there is no shortage of supply already.",

All of its athletes are barred from the ongoing Paralympics.\n\"Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia,\" Wada director-general Olivier Niggli said.\nThis is the latest twist in what was already the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport, and further evidence of the bitter divisions it has sparked.\nThe hack appears to be an act of revenge - retaliation for Wada's damning report into Russian state-sponsored cheating.\nAlthough the Russian government has denied any involvement, it has always maintained that the country has been made a scapegoat for a much wider problem, and this will only add fuel to that fire.\nAlthough the athletes concerned have broken no rules, the revelations - along with the threat of more leaks of other competitors' medical records - will inevitably exacerbate the controversy surrounding TUEs at a time when sport's leaders are desperately trying to restore trust.\nMany athletes will now be nervously wondering if their private medical details records are the next to be made public.\nAnd with the future of Wada currently in the balance, the fact its security was so badly compromised will raise more questions over the entire anti-doping system, especially after the account of Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova was hacked last month, leading to fears for her safety.\nUS Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart called the hack \"cowardly and despicable\".\n\"In each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication,\" he said.\nThe US Olympic Committee has had \"zero adverse findings from the Rio Olympic Games that weren't 100% within the medical guidelines set forth by anti-doping authorities,\" spokesman Patrick Sandusky said.\nEarlier this month, Mr Niggli said Wada was experiencing almost daily cyber attacks originating from Russia.\nFancy Bears, which is also known as Tsar Team (APT28), has pledged to release confidential records from other national Olympic teams.\nIt's an old adage in cybersecurity that the weakest point of any supposedly secure system is the people that use it.\nWada says it believes this hack was made possible thanks to a successful spearphishing attack. Phishing is a term given to the technique of tricking a user into giving up crucial information - often by clicking a link that takes them to a malicious website disguised as a familiar one, such as the log-in page for a bank or social network.\nSpearphishing takes this one significant step further. While a phishing attack is often aimed at many people in the hope some will fall for it, spearphishing is highly targeted. Hackers perhaps identified a small number of people, or even just one person, and wrote a phishing attack specifically designed to trick them.\nOther than pushing a message of vigilance among staff, spearphishing is incredibly difficult to defend against. Attackers often scour the internet, looking for added information on the target that might make an email more believable. Sometimes even knowing a person's favourite football team is enough to tip the balance in making a spearphishing email seem genuine.",

According to Ipsos Mori, it increased by 16 percentage points from 2015 to 54%, although it warned that its turnout estimate should be treated with caution.\nDespite the apparent increases in turnout among young people, Ipsos Mori and YouGov both agreed that older people were still considerably more likely to vote.\nYouGov estimated the turnout among over 70s at 84%.\nA university education looks like an indicator as to how someone might have voted on 8 June.\n\"While the Conservatives' support decreases the more educated a voter is, the opposite was true for Labour and the Lib Dems,\" YouGov said.\n\"Alongside age, education has become one of the key electoral demographic dividing lines.\"\nIpsos Mori gave the Tories a whopping 17-point lead among people with no qualifications - and a seven point lead with voters educated to below degree level.\nBut it said Labour had a 15-point lead among graduates (YouGov gave Labour a 17-point lead here).\nAccording to YouGov, class is \"no longer a very good indicator of voting intention\", finding little difference among the different socio-economic groupings between the two largest parties.\nIn a reversal of the traditional class divide in British politics, Ipsos Mori found: \"The middle classes swung to Labour, while working classes swung to the Conservatives.\"\nIt's only two years since the last general election - and the Tories and Labour both kept 90% of their 2015 voters, Ipsos Mori says. Lord Ashcroft had this as 83% for Labour and 82% for the Tories.\nBut only half of the Lib Dems' voters from last time around stayed with the party, Ipsos Mori said (more on this below).\nThat was a finding from Ipsos Mori, which said Labour's lead here increased by six points to 54 points.\nTurnout among black and minority ethnic voters also increased by six points since 2015, it said.\nThis was despite a concerted effort by the Conservatives to close the gap with Labour.\nRemainers in last year's referendum tended to back Labour, Leavers the Tories.\nLabour led the Conservatives by 47% to 33% among Remainers - while the Conservatives beat Labour by 46% to 39% among Leavers, Ipsos Mori said.\nLord Ashcroft found that just over two-thirds of people who voted Tory on 8 June had backed Leave a year earlier - two thirds of Labour voters voted for Remain.\nNo great surprise here. YouGov found the most pro-Conservative readership was the Daily Telegraph, followed by the Express and the Mail, all titles that backed Theresa May's party.\nGuardian readers were most likely to back Labour followed by the Mirror's.\nThe Lib Dems' vote share was only slightly down from 2015 - but as mentioned above, Ipsos Mori said  only half of the party's 2015 voters stayed with them this time.\nWhere did the rest come from? Roughly the same number of Labour and Tories, says Ipsos Mori. But despite this \"significant churn\", the demographic profile of Lib Dems voters is \"little changed\", it said.",

Just go to gov.uk and search for 'view driving licence',\" said Oliver Morley, the DVLA's chief executive.\nHe said that motorists could also save their driving records as a PDF file, which they could store on a mobile device.\nThe DVLA has produced a step-by-step guide to help motorists through the process.\nFor those who forget to take a code, a phone number is also available, but only between the hours of 8am and 7pm on weekdays, and 8am and 2pm on Saturdays.\nIn many cases, motorists hiring a car are not asked for evidence of convictions. Nevertheless drivers are being advised to contact their hire company before they travel, to see which documents they need to bring with them.\nSmaller hire companies, especially based abroad, may be unaware of the changes.\nAs many as eight million old-style paper licences - which carry endorsements on them - will remain valid.\nHowever endorsements will no longer be added to them by the courts.\nThe government has defended the new system, saying it will save millions of pounds, and reduce red tape.\nLast year, the DVLA had to replace 445,000 paper counterparts. Motorists who lost them were charged \u00c2\u00a320 for replacements.\nHowever, the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association said it would be much better if there were an online IT system which hire companies could use to check convictions themselves.\nIt, too, has produced advice for motorists.\nThe new arrangements are valid in Britain only.

But their plight is a lot more serious than that.\nThe twin problems, the apparent climax of the long-running Greek drama, and Mr Cameron's curtain-raiser to UK renegotiation, disguise the depth of the real problem.\nThe tortuous detail, the twists and turns to these two stories tend to obscure the fact that they are the symptoms, not the disease.\nGrexit would be horrible for the union. Brexit would be worse.\nThe two possibilities are linked by an overarching crisis, both less dramatic and far more serious.\nLooming in the background, meet - EUex.\nNot \"ex\" for exit, but for existential crisis - in both the philosophical sense of purpose and meaning, and the more literal definition - that its very existence is at stake.\nThese triple challenges might lead to fracture and fragmentation - or Eurofrag, if you prefer.\nYou might think that is good or bad. It is certainly important.\nIn my years as the BBC's Europe editor, from 2005 to 2009, there was plenty of debate about the future of the European Union, but I never took seriously the idea that it might one day cease to exist. That no longer seems so fanciful.\nThe founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet, used to say: \"Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.\"\nThe equation these days rather points towards subtraction, and the crisis could drive Mr Monet's project backwards.\nHow these traumas are treated over the next few years will define what the EU becomes.\nIt is just possible it will be on a terminal path to decay and disintegration.\nYou may cheer, or you may mourn, but you cannot argue that it would be anything other than hugely consequential for the whole continent.\nThe strains that threaten to tear the EU apart can be summed up by the three nations that stand for different facets of the challenge - Greece, the UK and Ukraine.\nThe clash between the implacable Greek government and the immovable forces of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission seems to be reaching an increasingly bad-tempered climax.\nA Greece euro exit might lead to it leaving the EU, according to the Greek central bank.\nAnything that might be hailed as a solution is unlikely to deal with the fundamental problem.\nSo instability and the dark cloud of exit will continue to hang over the continent.\nThe Euro project put the political cart firmly ahead of the horse, trundling along, dragging a few rather fine stallions, harnessed to assorted cart horses and the occasional donkey behind it.\nMaintaining a steady pace appears impossible, uncoupling the ill-suited nags unpalatable, for while the EU is not the same as the Euro, the single currency is an expression of its pride, ambition, and aspirations.\nIf countries start talking about flaking off, it makes the whole business look, well, flaky. EUfrag, indeed.\nThen there is the UK.\nIf the UK goes, it would blow a hole in the  EU, undermining its credibility around the world.\nBehind the need for renegotiation is the public mood.\nOnce thought of as a British eccentricity, Euroscepticism is now a force across the continent.\nIf the National Front's leader, Marine Le Pen, wins the French presidential elections in 2016, she will take France out of the European Union.\nIf British exit would leave the foundations a little shaky, removing the French cornerstone would surely lead to collapse.\nBut the electoral politics is just an expression of a public mood, a lack of even a little love for the EU.\nIt has failed is to persuade people it has a positive purpose that makes their lives better.\nInertia and an unloved status quo is a shaky foundation for any political organisation.\nUkraine and its bloody civil war raise the question of the EU's reach and purpose.\n\"What is the European Union for?\" used to be a cosy fireside, post-prandial debate over good brandy for the cognoscenti.\nNow, it is more like the tortured cry of an adolescent questioning if life has any meaning.\nEurovision may throw its arms wide to Australia and Israel, but the European Union is uncertain whether it is an idea or a geographical expression.\nThere is little doubt the expansion into the former Soviet bloc has given it indigestion.\nLike a goat still clearly defined in the stomach of a snake, the former Communist countries are taking a while to absorb.\nBut the Western nations could not allow a project forged in the heat of World War Two to be contained by boundaries set in place by that conflict.\nAs with the euro, a romantic vision of what should be drove the politics.\nBut even the most idealistic baulk at the idea of imminent expansion to Georgia, Ukraine or Moldova.\nSerbia and a few others are waiting dutifully in line for now, but the influence of the rouble is growing stronger in the Balkans.\nTurkey has already been rebuffed partly on grounds of religion and culture.\nIceland is distinguished by becoming the first nation to change its mind and say: \"No thanks,\" to membership.\nThe financial crisis and the lack of self-confidence may be demagnetising the EU.\nNone of the above is about either inevitability or desirability.\nBut one gets the feeling Europe's leader are blundering through a storm, more worried about immediate survival than eventual destination.\nSome have a strong enough teleological faith in the project that nothing will shake their belief that it has a destiny and a future.\nOthers will observe that it has proved pretty robust so far and talk of collapse is pretty hysterical.\nSome would dismiss this all as irrelevant flim-flam and worry instead about their own nation's concerns.\nBut this is a crossroads. And whether politicians want to hasten the process or halt it, they should be thinking about what lies further up the road.\nWhatever happens to the European Union, Europe itself will remain.\nThis is about the future of a continent, and what happens if a noble, flawed vision crumbles.",

He wore a mask of Mr Abu Ismail's face over his own long beard and held up an Egyptian flag.\n\"President Mubarak made us eat bread with salt but Sheikh Hazem will let us eat bread with butter,\" he added.  \"He has many good ideas.\"\nMr Abu Ismail, who is 51, has expounded his political beliefs in weekly lectures at the Asad Ibn al-Farat mosque in Cairo and in TV appearances.\nHis main message has been the need to impose Islamic law \"gradually\".\nFor example, he wants to \"create the conditions\" whereby all women would, over time, be persuaded to wear a headscarf as a religious duty.\nHe also aspires to stop married women from working once they have children, and ultimately to segregate the sexes in the workplace.\nEgyptian liberals have been in turn, outraged and bemused, by suggestions Mr Abu Ismail has made in video clips that have been widely circulated on the internet.\nIn one, he suggests that requiring girls to be aged over 12 before marriage goes against holy law and in another, he claims that nutmeg should be avoided because it could have drug-like properties.\nMany experts dismissed his economic and social plans as unviable. These included an idea to make the Sinai desert green, using charity to supply building materials and thus lower housing costs, and abolishing prisons to replace them with rehabilitation centres.\nHazem Abu Ismail's political vision has provided his critics with a lot of material for making fun.\nOne politics student produced his own video, parodying the hit by the rock band AC/DC, Highway to Hell. His song, Highway to Abu Ismail, includes the line: \"Forget the beer and aniseed drink. No bikinis or spaghetti-straps for women.\"\nYet the one-time challengers of Mr Abu Ismail may be able to learn a lot from his campaign.\nThe first lesson is not to overlook the power of a portion of Egyptian society with ultraconservative or Salafist religious beliefs that feels it has been overlooked and disenfranchised in the past. This was already demonstrated by Egypt's parliamentary election, in which the Salafist Nour party took a quarter of the seats in the new parliament.\nThe success of the grassroots movement that built support for Mr Abu Ismail contains a second lesson.\nHis aides insisted that supporters paid for their own poster runs and then sold them to others, feeding the money back into the campaign coffers.\n\"The Sheikh did not pay anything, only the brothers, and we sell these items at low prices,\" a Salafist salesman, Ali, explained as he showed off a range of T-shirts with the candidates' legend - \"We will live in dignity\" - as well as key chains and posters. \"We pay because we love Islam.\"\nWhile such items may soon be reclassified as political memorabilia, Mr Abu Ismail's rivals have not yet come close to energising voters in the same way.",

As an example, it says that over 50 years, an annual fall of just 0.1% in economic output would cause Britain's debt-to-GDP ratio to be 50 percentage points higher.\nIt says that the way taxes are raised is changing as society changes. It outlines ways in which taxes are bringing less cash into the Treasury:\nThe OBR also examines how another crisis in the financial sector could hit the government's budget, largely because of the large contribution it makes in taxes. Finance and insurance accounts for 3% of the UK workforce but represents 7% of economic output.\nThe report says: \"Financial crises are fiscally costly. Regulation has been tightened since the crisis, but credit-related vulnerabilities remain. And Brexit and cyber-security represent new sources of risk.\"\nAs well as dealing with the obvious threats the 300 page report highlights a range of risks that could batter the government's tax and spending plans in the coming years.\nIt covers everything from foreign currency exposure to cost over-runs in infrastructure projects like the HS2 high speed rail link.\nFor instance, it explains how NHS spending on clinical negligence claims has doubled in cash terms over the past six years and has risen by almost half over the past two.\nThe reports adds: \"There is a risk that greater pressures on medical professionals lead to higher numbers of incidents and future claims. This type of adverse feedback seems plausible\".\nOn the future cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations, it says that estimates range from \u00a395- \u00a3218bn.\nIt says: \"While the numbers are big from the perspective of the department managing them they are less so from the perspective of the public sector as a whole. That said ... the risk that annual spending rises by more than \u00a31bn in any year is far from negligible.\"\nAnd it also covers the risks of \"unanticipated events\" which include everything from flu pandemics to coastal flooding and widespread electricity failure.\nIt says: \"successive terrorist attacks have prompted debate over the funding of police and security services, while the number of tower blocks that have failed fire safety tests since the tragedy at Grenfell Tower could require significant sums to resolve\".\nUnder its charter, the Office for Budget Responsibility has to produce a report on fiscal risks every two years.

What difference will that make?\"\nBut the general was far from negative about the political implications of deeper British involvement.\nIt was all about deepening the involvement of another significant Middle East player who was at least trying get the stubborn pieces of that kaleidoscope moving.\nThere is a keen awareness in the Middle East that rich Western democracies prefer to use air-power alone in this sort of situation without committing their own ground forces.\nIt may be less effective but the political, military and financial costs are all lower - and so is the risk of punishment by voters if things go wrong or stretch on longer than promised.\nYou still need boots on the ground to win any war of course - the question is always \"whose boots?\"\nThe estimate by the British Prime Minister David Cameron that a force of 70,000 moderate rebels was ready to take on the so-called Islamic State - or Daesh as it is known in the Middle East - has been the subject of fierce debate.\nThe Syrian battlefield is extraordinarily complex and fragmented and there are hundreds of groups and sub-groups at play, some of them small and local, others able to call on thousands of fighters across the country.\nAll are united in the belief that the military and political priority must remain the overthrown of Bashar al-Assad.\nOtherwise it is difficult to calibrate their positions on any sliding scale of moderation or extremism or even to place them with precision on any religious or ideological spectrum.\nA senior official here in Jordan, speaking anonymously, said he had no doubt that there were tens of thousands of fighters who would be prepared to take on the so-called Islamic State - not least because in many parts of Syria, IS was attacking rival rebel groups rather than regime forces.\nBut others are much more sceptical about how numerous the forces that might be classed as moderate really are - especially in the light of the United States' disastrous experience of trying to raise, train, equip and deploy just such a force.\nOne Syrian opposition official here told the BBC that it was likely that there would be some kind of reckoning with Islamic State after Mr Assad had been overthrown - but he was reluctant to put a timeframe on what would undoubtedly be a messy and dangerous end-game.\nDealing with the more immediate issue, another rebel source said that Britain's original decision to confine air operations against IS targets in Iraq had not been logical when seen from the Middle East and that an expansion of air operations into Syria was both natural and welcome.\nAnd that sums up a lot of the reaction to the British debate you hear in Amman - a wider role for the UK is seen as something to be welcomed.\nBut it is also seen as just another step on a long journey whose end is not in sight.",

VW and unions have been hammering out a plan to revive its fortunes since June.\nVolkswagen chief executive, Matthias Mueller, said it was \"the biggest modernisation programme in the history of the group's core brand\".\n\"The VW brand needs a real shake-up and that is exactly what the future pact has turned out to be,\" he added.\nThe car giant - which employs 610,000 people in 31 countries - wants to increase the brand's profit margin from 2% to 4% and to do this it will need to improve productivity at its German plants by 25%.\nIt has 120,000 workers in Germany so the cuts represent a fifth of employees in its heartland.\nVolkswagen has pledged there will be no compulsory redundancies and the top staff representative in Germany, Bernd Osterloh, said the new models would be built there: \"The next generation of electric vehicles will be made here in Germany, not abroad.\"\nVolkswagen has been battling a crisis caused by its attempts to dodge strict US emissions limits.\nIt was revealed in the US last year that VW's diesel cars were fitted with software that \"knew\" when cars were being tested.\nThe company has agreed to pay $15bn in a settlement with US authorities and owners of about 500,000 vehicles.\nAround 11 million cars worldwide have the software.\nThe VW group comprises 12 brands from seven European countries: Volkswagen passenger cars, Audi, Seat, Skoda, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN.\nProfessor Christian Stadler, from Warwick Business School, said Friday's announcement about electric cars marked \"a new strategy in a rapidly changing car market\".\nChina, the world's biggest car market, is introducing an e-vehicle quota in 2018, where 8% of all vehicles sold will have to be electric. That quota rises to 12% in 2020.\nProf Stadler said: \"It means VW would have to sell 60,000 e-vehicles in China by 2018, and hybrids only represent half a point. Even BMW, one of the pioneers of electronic cars has sold just 1,204 e-vehicles in China in 2016 up to September.\n\"Norway's sovereign wealth fund holds a sizeable stake in VW and has been putting pressure on them to become more environmentally friendly.\" he said.\nVolkswagen is cutting 23,000 posts in Germany alone, but don't expect protests in the streets of the company's home town of Wolfsburg. This has been a hard-won deal drawn up after lengthy negotiations with union leaders. They call it the Future Pact.\nNo-one in Germany will be forced out - early retirement is likely to provide a large portion of the cuts. And VW is creating 9,000 'future proof' positions as part of a major investment in new technologies. Many workers will simply move into new posts.\nWhat this plan really represents is a culture shift at Volkswagen. Even before the emissions scandal, it was clear the core brand in the group was underperforming, with profit margins well below those of its rivals.\nThe scandal provided the catalyst for a major shift towards electric cars and potentially self driving systems. In future VW may be making fewer engines and more electric motors, fewer gearboxes and more batteries. Software and sensors will become ever more important.\nSuch a transformation will cost money - at a time when VW is still paying the price for its emissions misdemeanours. So saving $4bn a year looks like a very good idea.",

        "source_text": "Since political reforms began in Myanmar, also known as Burma, in 2011, the economy has been growing steadily at more than 5% a year.\nIn Yangon, also known as Rangoon, that change is evident in new buildings, nascent shopping malls and, unfortunately, the traffic.\nSome have done very well since the lifting of international sanctions and the opening up of Myanmar's economy. But what about those at the bottom of the pile?\nThan Nyunt, 50, earns a living diving for scraps of iron and timber in the Yangon River. Each morning, he boards a creaking wooden boat and heads out on to the water.\nAt a promising-looking spot, an anchor is dropped and dragged along the river bed. If it hits something, Than Nyunt dons a rudimentary home-made mask and leaps into the water.\nThe Yangon River serves as the sewer as well as the lifeblood for Myanmar's largest city. Its colour is somewhere between melted milk chocolate and black coffee. Visibility is zero.\n\"We are clever at this and experienced. We know the river,\" he says with a smile.\n\"When we're on the river bed we crawl on our hands and knees touching things.\"\nFinding anything is largely down to luck. On average, he earns about $15 (\u00c2\u00a310) a day. But turning up a large piece of iron such as a propeller or anchor, can earn his team between $50 and $100.\nIt is a dangerous business. The air he breathes is pumped from a simple compressor through a hose that can easily snag.\n\"Many people have been killed doing this, including my trainer and some of my friends,\" he says.\nSome divers have been trapped inside shipwrecks or had their masks ripped off by strong, underwater currents.\nMyanmar's recent transformation has made very little difference to the divers, but for others it has brought opportunity.\nWith diplomats for parents, Ye Htut Win or Sharky , as he is better known, spent most of his formative years living abroad. During that time he developed a passion for European delicacies, and in the mid-1990s challenged himself to return home and make them.\nHe employed farmers on the outskirts of Yangon to grow vegetables which he then sold to Yangon's hotels. Later, he tried replicating Western dishes.\n\"I've always believed that good food has a power, a magic that can bring joy,\" he says.\nShielded by the cocoon of sanctions and Myanmar's pariah status, Sharky was able to hone his skills as a farmer, gourmet cheesemaker and baker.\n\"The country was isolated, it was literally lockdown so I had no competition,\" he says. \"Literally you could do what you want. As long as it was not politics.\"\nBut the market was also limited. There was a very small group of resident expats, and most Burmese had not tasted Western food.\nBut with the country opening up and the number of tourists rising each year, Sharky is now reaping the rewards.\nHe is about to open his fourth branch, on the iconic Pansodan street in downtown Yangon. Like his other restaurants-cum-delis, it will sell everything from hummus and ham, to Burmese sea salt.\nHe believes that whatever happens politically, Myanmar's economic transformation is irreversible.\n\"I think the genie is out of the bottle,\" he says. \"During this period, whoever governs the country, jobs have to be provided, futures have to be provided for, and I do believe that you cannot stop it anymore.\"\nNang Kham Noung has been destined for Myanmar's top table since birth. Her father is the well-connected founder and chairman of the country's biggest bank KBZ.\nThanks in part to its close ties to the government, KBZ has grown rapidly from just 50 branches in 2011 to more than 350 now.\nAfter studying in Singapore, London and Qatar, Marlene, as she prefers to be called, was summoned back to Yangon by her father and, at the age of 24, became the fresh-faced executive director of KBZ Group.\n\"My sister and I are second generation business leaders. The plan is that my father will pass on the bank to my sisters and I to run the business.\"\nFor now, she is focused on learning how the business works. Cash is still king in Myanmar - a legacy of a run on the country's private banks in 2003 - so branch offices are piled high with blocks of banknotes.\n\"We have just reintroduced cards so it's taking time to rebuild confidence in the system,\" she says.\nUntil recently, sanctions meant the Burmese financial system was, in effect, cut off from the international network. That is slowly changing.\nCash machines in Myanmar accept foreign cards but transactions between Western and Burmese banks are still complicated.\n\"It's getting easier every day,\" Marlene says. \"But it's still more difficult than in other countries because international banks are just getting to know us again and they have their own compliance policies.\"\nInternet entrepreneur Ye Myat Min is also 24, and on paper at least, also a millionaire.\nHis fortune though is entirely self-made. Two and a half years ago Ye Myat's internet and app design company Nex started by renting six desks in a dingy building in downtown Yangon.\nAt the time, Ye Myat divided his time between his studies in Singapore and trying to get the business off the ground.\nThe combination did not work. His grades plummeted and, much to his parents' annoyance, he dropped his studies and returned to work full-time in Yangon.\nBut the timing was good. Myanmar was on the cusp of a connectivity revolution.  State-of-the-art mobile networks were about to be built across the country and smartphone sales were rocketing.\n\"The internet connection back in 2009 was really bad,\" Ye Myat says. Bad enough that he could watch a feature film in the time that it took to load a single simple web page.\nThese days, the internet is not as good as other Asian countries but, says Ye Myat, it is \"getting usable\".\nYe Myat's most popular and controversial product is an anonymous chatting app called Hush. It enables people to exchange messages without revealing anything about themselves.\nMyanmar's past as a closed-off country means that many people are \"very conservative, shy and closed about their opinions\", he explains.\nHis anonymous platform allows people to speak more openly about their opinions.\nThe company currently has 30 employees and is expecting to add another 10 in the coming months. They are hoping to become profitable too.\nWhen Myanmar goes to the polls on 8 November, it will take a leap into the unknown after 25 years of military rule. However, one man is approaching the day with certainty if not clarity.\nSan Zarni Bo is the country's most famous astrologer, dispensing predictions in newspapers and on radio stations and in person from a modest house on the outskirts of Yangon.\nInside, the waiting room is packed, mainly with women. Some of them are pregnant and wanting guidance on an auspicious date for a Caesarean, others seek advice on their children's names.\nEach morning, he sees up to 30 people reading palms and analysing birth dates making, he tells us, more than $1,000 a day.\n\"Astrology is based on both the tradition and the culture here in Myanmar,\" he explains.\n\"It's for everything. If they want to build a house the astrologer can calculate a good time to start it.\"\nBut San Zarni Bo dispenses more than personal advice.\nAstrology and numerology permeate Burmese political life and key decisions. Even the timing of the move to the new capital Nay Pyi Taw is said to have been taken on advice of fortune tellers.\nThe outlook for election day, according to San Zarni Bo, is mixed at best.\n\"It's not an auspicious day. In fact, it's a very bad day,\" he says. \"There may be instability. There may be a coup d'etat.\"\nHe is a longstanding supporter of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and has predicted she will eventually become the country's president.\n\"She's like a diamond being polished getting brighter and brighter. She's born on 19 June - she can gain more and more from the instability.\"\nPart of the Myanmar Direct series.",

The curriculum will also include some vocational skills.\nTransgender activist Vijayraja Mallika, who heads the school, told the BBC: \"The school aims at making transgenders eligible for taking decent jobs and living a dignified life.\"\n\"We have admitted six candidates so far, all male-to-female persons, from 14 applicants.

It promotes inclusive education, and offers free gender reassignment surgery at government hospitals.\nThe centre's organisers said they had arranged sponsors for all the students, to pay for their food, accommodation and studies.\nThe teachers also belong to the transgender community - a measure designed to protect and encourage the pupils.\nThe decision comes after India's first transgender college principal, Manabi Bandopadhyay, resigned from her post claiming that some of her students and fellow teachers had agitated against her because of her sexual identity.\nIndia has an estimated two million transgender people, and in 2014 the country's Supreme Court ruled that they have equal rights under the law.\nAs well as the right to marry and inherit property, they are also eligible for quotas in jobs and educational institutions.\nBut abuse and exploitation are still common. Many transgender people are thrown out of home by their families, denied jobs, and forced into sex work, begging, or dancing at weddings to make ends meet.\nEven finding a venue for the school was a challenge, as nobody was willing to rent the founders their premises.\n\"We approached some 700 people and 51 households, and all of them turned us away. They seemed to think that we were looking for space for prostitution,\" Ms Mallika said.\nFinally, a suitable site was found.\nAll of the school's first students come from Kerala, but Ms Mallika hopes to gather more from beyond the state.\n\"This is a model centre.

Bloating, or swelling in the abdomen\n??? Pelvic or abdominal pain (especially in the lower abdomen or side)\n??? Difficulty eating or early satiety (feeling full very quickly)\n??? Urinary urgency or frequency\n??? Loss of appetite or weight loss\n??? Swelling or pain in the abdomen\n??? Pain during sex\n??? Constipation\n??? Irregular periods\nIn the advanced stages of disease, there may be loss of appetite, nausea, weight loss, tiredness and shortness of breath. It is infrequent that an obvious symptom such as bleeding from the vagina is present.\nWhile it is often misinterpreted as irritable bowel syndrome, the charity's Frances Reid said it is very important for GPs and all health professionals to be aware of the different type of signs that come with ovarian cancer.\n\"The problem is that most women aren't diagnosed until the disease has spread,\" she said.\n\"There are delays almost at every turn for women.\n\"Either they don't recognise the symptoms, the GPs aren't picking up the symptoms, or the GPs, when they do consider ovarian cancer, are sometimes having tests refused.\"\nEarly diagnosis is key to survival.\nWomen diagnosed at the earliest stage of ovarian cancer have a five-year survival rate of 92%, but the five-year survival rate in the UK is just 36%, amongst the worst in Europe.\nNICE (The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) also recommend that any woman aged 50 or over who has had symptoms within the last 12 months which suggest a new diagnosis of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) should have tests for ovarian cancer.\nIBS rarely presents for the first time in women of this age and may be confused with ovarian cancer.\nExperts say 500 lives a year could be saved through earlier diagnosis of the cancer, if the UK could match the best rates in Europe.\nAccording to the Pathfinder Study there are three areas for concern: How long it takes women to initially visit their GP; how quickly the condition is diagnosed and what services are available to health professionals to treat women with ovarian cancer.\nOne in four women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the last five years took more than three months to visit their GP after they began experiencing symptoms.\nAbout half took more than a month.\nEarly ovarian cancer may not cause obvious symptoms - but as the cancer grows symptoms may include a swollen or bloated abdomen, constipation, pressure in the abdomen and fatigue.\nAs these symptoms are often associated with other conditions, it can be difficult for GPs to diagnose the condition.\nAccording to the study, misdiagnosis is common, with 30% of women misdiagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome; 15% ovarian cysts and 13% a urinary infection.\nThe Pathfinder study is being launched at the House of Commons later.",

That's up from 65% in 2013 and 2014, says Pew.\nBut when it comes to the issue of post-9/11 interrogation techniques - which many consider to be torture - the US has received a worldwide rebuke.\nChinese and US officials, at the helm of the world's biggest economies, are meeting in Washington for annual talks.\nWhile the recent global downturn stoked fears that the US was losing ground to China economically, there has actually been a rise in the number of people who think the US is still on top.\nOf the 40 countries polled, a majority in 30 of them view the US as the world's biggest economic power. India has seen the biggest jump in the number of people who think the US is on top.\nHowever, it's important to note that majorities in 27 countries believe that China will eventually replace the US as the world's top superpower.\nThe European Union is the most convinced of China's inevitable supremacy.\nWhen it comes to the US-led fight against Islamic State, the US enjoys broad support.\nA median of 62% of people around the world say that they support US military actions against the Islamic State group. That figure is compared to the 24% of people who oppose US-led efforts against the group in Iraq and Syria.\nWhile the Iraq war that raged a decade ago was largely unpopular, majorities in America's key European allies are supportive of the campaign.\nA near-majority of people in important Middle Eastern allies are supportive as well.\nBack home, 80% of Americans - including 88% of Republicans and 80% of Democrats - view the campaign favourably. Across the northern border, the fight enjoys the support of about two-thirds of the Canadian public.\nWhat's not popular? The interrogation techniques employed by the US following the 9/11 attacks.\nA median of 50% of people disapproved of the US government's interrogation techniques that it used on suspected terrorists - techniques that many described as torture.\nOnly 35% said the techniques were justified.\nMajorities in the United Kingdom, Spain, Germany and France said the so-called torture was not justified.\nInterestingly, there were some outliers. Italians were largely split on the issue, and people in Poland tended to believe that interrogation techniques were justified.\nIn the Middle East and Asia, the techniques were largely seen in a negative light - except in Israel, India and the Philippines.\nMost Americans, though, see the techniques as justified - but sharply divided along political lines, with Republicans largely supportive and Democrats largely not.\nThe US president, however, enjoys widespread support that, in many places, has been growing - except for in one country.\nMr Obama's popularity in Israel has taken a nosedive in Israel over the past 12 months. Last year, he had the backing of 71% of Israelis. But this year, only 49% gave him the thumbs-up.\nHowever in India the opposite is true. Over the past year, his popularity in that country jumped from 48% to 71%. He's seen his popularity grow in 14 of the surveyed countries.\nConsidering people in all 40 countries around the world, Mr Obama has the backing of a median of 69% of people (much higher than his approval rating in the US).\nIn all the countries surveyed in the EU and sub-Saharan Africa, half or more support the American president. In 29 countries, majorities said they were confident that Mr Obama would do the right thing when it came to world affairs.\nThe Pew survey was conducted between March and May of this year, and included responses from over 45,000 respondents.",

A higher proportion of people are in jobs than the Welsh average and more are self-employed too.\nBut it is the types of jobs that are the key - and that includes more part-time workers.\nWages are also lower. The median gross weekly full-time wage in Powys was \u00a3414 in 2014; across Wales it was \u00a3473.\nSMALL BUSINESSES BUT LOWER WAGES\nThe old Lion works in Newtown used to make bikes after World War II but the shell of the old factory is now a maze of small businesses.\nIn Powys, nine out of 10 firms have fewer than nine workers.\nFormer cleaner Kim Gallagher started her laundry business Kim and Co in 2008 when she spotted a gap in the market to serve hotels, holiday lets and families. She employs five people - three part-time workers and two students on minimum wage.\nKim said of the business centre: \"Behind all the doors you'll find a different business up and running; some are small, some are large. There are all sorts - one makes blinds, there's carpentry and joinery and plastic moulding.\n\"There's not really a lot of scope for more [than minimum wage] - a lot of people work for themselves or with a couple of people in the business.\n\"There are jobs out there if you want to find them - there's a KFC coming down the road, which brings job opportunities. A lot of the young girls are going into caring, I see a lot of that.\"\nTRANSPORT ISSUES\nLack of transport is a big issue in much of rural Wales.\nBefore Bea Lloyd moved into town she struggled to get to work in Newtown by bus from her home five miles away.\n\"It depends on the buses and how they go. Sometimes they don't turn up at all, it can be difficult. I was living in Abermule so it was a long walk if there was no bus or I couldn't get a lift, and that was an hour-and-a-half walk.\"\nTOURISM AND FARMING\nTourism is important to rural Wales - cafes, restaurants and hotels employ around one in six people in Powys. Agriculture too is much more important here, making up 11% of the workforce, compared to the Welsh average of 2%.\nMANIFESTO HEADLINES FROM THE PARTIES:\nMANUFACTURING STILL IMPORTANT\nWhat is surprising is that manufacturing is as important to jobs here as for all of Wales. Those employed in manufacturing make up 11% of the workforce in Powys, exactly the same as the Wales average.\nAmongst the hills and the sheep farms is a Welsh-owned company which exports to 80 countries across the world.\nIn 18 years, Invertek has gone from three local men in an old milking parlour to a firm employing 170 people in Welshpool with a turnover of \u00a324 million.\nTheir electronic drives make motors more energy efficient and can be found in a host of different industries.\nEdd Rayner, innovation projects manager, comes from a farming background and says he wants to see a \"balanced economy\".\n\"We don't want to forget our history but there are companies like Invertek showing it can be done and there's no reason we can't have big international companies doing really great things in mid Wales, in the rural economy.\n\"We need to make sure there are opportunities for those intelligent and knowledgeable people who come from the local area.\"\nHow do we help more Welsh firms develop into big players on a world stage?\nAnother farmer's son is Glyn Jones, one of the founders.\nThe company is about to open a factory in Shenyang in China.\n\"The biggest single thing we did was be outward looking,\" he said.\n\"I come from mid Wales and live in mid Wales - but we look out to the world, and export 90% of what we produce.\n\"The infrastructure's good - we're close to Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham airports - and with the internet we're one click away from anywhere.\n\"It's confidence to use the skills here of local people, there's no reason why others can't follow what we've done. It might look complex from outside what we do but it's electronic Lego.\"\nHe regrets the passing of the Welsh Development Agency, which had been a \"good, outward looking organisation\" but said the Welsh Government was providing generous assistance to let them expand the factory.\nRAISING THE VALUE OF WHAT WE DO\nThe advantage to the Welsh economy of firms like this is they tend to pay higher wages, that get spent locally.\nMore of the better paid jobs will help raise the GVA of Powys - that is the gross value added to the local economy.\nPowys had 65.1% of UK average GVA per head in 2014, lower than the Wales figure - 71.4%.\nInvertek technician Daniel Evans told me he was happy with the money he got and said his friends were all in work.\nColleague Alison Jones said there was plenty of work in the area but not all of it was well paid.\n\"Higher paid jobs would keep younger people in the area,\" she said.\n\"Cheaper housing is also what they need. It's difficult to buy a house around here for the youngsters.\"\nAnd that is the challenge. The more better paid workers there are in the community, the more high spenders, the better it is for a range of local business and the economy.",

I think anyone who has a diagnosis of miscarriage and potentially has surgery would expect that that diagnosis is right.\"\nHe argues the cut-offs should be about 25mm instead of 20mm for the sac and 7mm for an embryo without a heartbeat. He also wants a greater emphasis on repeat scans.\nHe said: \"There's not a medical cost to being more cautious in what we're doing.\"\nProf Siobhan Quenby, from University Hospital Coventry, welcomed greater attention and clarity on the issue, but said: \"I really don't think many mistakes are being made.\"\nShe said people were aware of issues with the guidance and if there was any doubt, further tests, not a termination, would take place.\nIt is \"very common that people come back for a second scan\", she said.\nFor those with a miscarriage diagnosis, she said that in the majority of cases there would be no medical intervention. About 30% would take tablets or have surgery to end the pregnancy.\nDr Mark Hamilton, consultant gynaecologist at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, said the findings \"reinforce the need for clinical staff to continue to exercise great care in the diagnosis of non-viable pregnancy to minimise the risk of misdiagnosis.\n\"Women should continue to be managed expectantly without the need for medical treatment or surgery until the diagnosis of non-viability is established with certainty.\"\nThe National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is currently developing guidelines for the care of women who experience pain and bleeding in early pregnancy.  There is already guidance available from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.\nThis will include the role of ultrasound in determining the viability of a pregnancy and will draw on this research.

The national network is maintained thanks to a joint operation by the North Korean government and Egyptian telecoms company Orascom.\nPhones on the network are heavily restricted. They cannot access the internet and can only make calls within North Korea.\nFor a short time, foreigners in the country were able to use mobile internet, but this access was later revoked.\nIt is believed that many in North Korea, particular those near the borders, use illegally owned mobiles to contact people outside the country.\nOne man, a 28-year-old who left North Korea in November 2010, told a research paper: \"In order to make sure the mobile phone frequencies are not being tracked, I would fill up a washbasin with water and put the lid of a rice cooker over my head while I made a phone call.\"\nBeing found in possession of a foreign phone would be a very serious crime, the paper's authors said.\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC",

If it does end tomorrow, I'll be sad but I'll be proud of what I've achieved.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAs captain, Cook saw series victories in South Africa and India, as well as two Ashes wins on home soil, with Cook himself becoming the first Englishman to reach 10,000 Test runs in this period.\nHowever, there were difficult times. A 5-0 series whitewash in Australia, the ongoing Kevin Pietersen saga and a perception of Cook himself as being a dour captain meant he was often under pressure.\n\"It's definitely different without the captaincy and I do feel less under pressure in the field,\" he said.\n\"On Monday, when South Africa were chasing - if I was captain on that Sunday night, I would definitely have had a broken sleep. I would have been worried and a lot more nervous.\n\"As it was, I turned up on Monday thinking 'we can win this quite easy'. But if I was captain, I would have been thinking 'what if this goes badly wrong; what if this happens, what if that happens'.\n\"You start to think a lot more negatively of the what ifs. As a player, you don't have that type of pressure. Maybe because, as captain, you are ultimately responsible for everything that goes on on the field and you feel it more. It's only when you win games that you feel what's changed.\"\nWhen Cook first took over from Andrew Strauss in 2012, his first full series in charge saw England beat India on the sub-continent, in conditions England have historically struggled in.\nCook scored runs, breaking the record for most Test centuries for England along the way, but by the time his side had sunk in the Ashes 18 months later, Cook was no longer the golden boy.\n\"I think it's very hard to shake what people first think of you straightaway. When I first came into the side as captain, I was accused of being quite conservative, quite negative, and just doing what Andrew Strauss did,\" he continued.\n\"Maybe I did for the first little bit. I was new to it and as you grow into the role, you feel more comfortable doing it. You can change and hopefully I did improve as captain.\n\"If it's going well, it's brilliant, if it's not, you're the worst captain ever. What I can say is, we won some great series. If someone had offered me that at the start, I would have snapped your hand off. The stuff in between was just part and parcel.\"\nCook has avoided social media when his team-mates have embraced it, and he thinks it now puts more pressure on new players.\n\"I do think it builds the pressure the guys are under - not in terms of the cricket and playing, and what you're trying to achieve, but certainly in terms of the scrutiny, even since the day I started, because it is more instant.\n\"I made my debut in 2006 and absolutely, there was the pressure of the cricket, but there was no social media. There was no direct feedback to your phone. If you wanted to, you could avoid it.\n\"Now, from the moment you're out, if you're on social media, someone can be sitting at home, and if you've played a bad shot or bowled a bad spell, they can almost directly get in contact with you. Every ball is there for someone to see.\"\nPerceptions of England, and of Cook the batsman, have changed in recent years. Despite winning the Ashes in the summer of 2013, Cook's team received a mixed reaction from fans. While appreciative of their success, some fans seemed to find it difficult to warm to individuals in the team.\n\"I remember sitting with Matt Prior when he was really struggling with his Achilles injury and his hand injury and he was going to take a break from the game, and we were sitting at Lord's talking about it,\" Cook said.\n\"If you'd read the things that were said five minutes before he announced the break, certainly on social media - 'we've got to get rid of Matt Prior,' all that sort of thing - and then as soon as he announced he was going to take a break, which unfortunately he never came back from, it was 'oh we're going to miss Matt Prior, what a great servant, what a great player, how are we going to replace him?' and it was an amazing thing, to see that difference.\n\"It shows what sport does, really. You're never as good as people say you are and you're never as bad as people say you are. You're always in the middle at some stage.\"",

it means children are less likely to do well at school or get good employment.\nOne in four of the world's children is stunted, so it has an impact not just on individuals but on whole economies.\nIn Chad, rates of stunting are even higher.\nSo what is being done?\nThe immediate priority of health teams here is to target the most severely malnourished children - those whose lives are in immediate danger.\nThere are now 500 nutrition centres across Chad, double the number four years ago.\nUnicef has helped fund the expansion as well as paying for the training of health workers and for vaccination programmes, along with aid partners such as the International Rescue Committee.\nAt the under-fives nutrition centre in Mongo, which is part of the town hospital, babies receive fortified milk while older children are given sachets of a peanut paste.\nThese are short-term fixes, but they can save many lives.\nZenaba Zakaclia, aged 19, brought her son to the hospital a week ago.\nNoura Adef, who's almost two, had measles and was severely malnourished.\nHe had no energy and spent his time lying on the bed or in his mother's lap.\nIn just four days I could see that his condition had dramatically improved and once his measles infection is cleared he will be able to return home.\nEfforts are also being made to help families deal with chronic malnutrition, where children may not appear physically ill or hungry, but they are not thriving.\nBreastfeeding for the first six months of life helps build the immune system and it is the best defence against infant malnutrition.\nBut only 3% of Chad's children are exclusively breastfed - one of the lowest rates in Africa.\nThe health centres also organise cooking demonstrations for new mothers, teaching them the nutritional values of different locally available ingredients.\nOne in six children in Chad die before the age of five, the third highest rate globally, behind Sierra Leone and Angola.\nOne in 15 women will die in childbirth.\nIn September, the UN General Assembly will vote on the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the global targets that will replace the MDGs from next year.\nUnicef's spokesman in Chad, Manuel Moreno, told me there had been some progress within the country, but much more was yet to be done.\n\"Millions of children in countries like Chad risk being left behind.\n\"We have to ensure that we reach the most vulnerable and the poorest, otherwise we will be failing future generations.\n\"That means providing quality education and health services which are accessible.\n\"The MDGs show that the issues of extreme poverty and hunger can be addressed - we simply need to be more ambitious.\"\nInstead of eight goals and 21 targets, the SDGs are vast: 17 goals and 169 targets and shift from trying to address the effects of poverty to targeting its root causes.\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron said last September that there were too many targets to communicate effectively and they risked \"sitting on a bookshelf gathering dust\".\nBut Unicef is pleased that the SDGs will address key issues not covered by the MDGs, including ending child marriage and violence against children.",

He told The Times: \"They are possibly quite dangerous to the art work and cause appalling crowding around a painting.\n\"Anyone who actually wants to go and see a painting can't because people are too busy taking photos. I've seen things in the National Gallery which make my hair stand on end.\"\nSome visitors at the National Gallery have backed the ban.\nMorny Davison told the Press Association the selfie stick was \"an interference in what one hopes is a reasonably calm experience looking at great pictures.\"\nAnother visitor said art lovers would be \"thrilled\" by the ban, adding: \"They should have been banned some time ago.\"\nOther British institutions could also follow the ban.\nThe British Museum has confirmed it is reviewing its policy on selfie sticks.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The safety of objects and visitors is paramount to the British Museum\".\nSelfie sticks are currently allowed at the National Portrait Gallery, but a spokesman said \"anything that may prove disruptive is reviewed on an ongoing basis.\".\n\"It is important that all our visitors enjoy their experience at the Gallery.\"\nThe Tate does still allow the use of selfie sticks \"provided that users respect fellow visitors and adhere to Tate's photography policy\".\nA spokesman for the Natural History Museum said it does not currently ban the use of selfie sticks and \"do not currently see a need to alter our stance on this issue\".\nThe National Museum Cardiff does not permit any camera extension devices such as tripods, and it classes selfie sticks under this category.\nA spokesperson said the policy was in place \"to ensure the safety of our visitors and the museum's collections, especially during crowded conditions.\n\"We encourage museum visitors to take selfies and share their experiences but leave the selfie sticks at home.\"\nThe BBC is awaiting confirmation from the National Galleries of Scotland to what their policy is.\nIt used to be so easy.\nCameras were banned - flashlight was bad for the pictures and visitors having their own copies of paintings was bad for business.\nThe camera phone changed all that - making it unfeasible for galleries to stop people taking photographs.\nThe selfie stick has introduced a new problem, which is to stop people looking at pictures and in so doing creates a distraction for those who are trying to study what the gallery has to offer. So the rationale for banning them is because they cause a disturbance - the side benefit being you will now once again have to go the museum shop to get your copy of your favourite picture.\nEarlier this month, the Smithsonian museum group announced it had banned selfie sticks from its 19 museums and galleries in the US capital.\n\"This is a preventive measure to protect visitors and objects, especially during crowded conditions,\" it said in a statement.\nIt followed similar restrictions from museums and galleries in the US including New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Modern Museum of Art (MOMA), the Getty Center in Los Angeles and the Cleveland Museum of Art.\nThe palace of Versailles was the first museum in Europe to ban the use of selfie sticks and it is expected that The Louvre and the Pompidou centre are likely to follow suit.\nSelfie sticks are also banned from music venues in the UK including the O2 and Wembley Arena.",

        "source_text": "The event is a launching pad for new features. After a busy first day, here's my pick of the most interesting and significant.\nAugmented reality - that\u2019s when digital images are placed over the real world - is the key battleground between Facebook and its bitter rival Snapchat. And AR Studio could be the differentiator.\nFacebook is opening up its AR platform so developers can make use of Facebook\u2019s immense computing power - for things like image recognition - without having to invest in the costly and complex tech themselves. AR studio is the tool they will be able to use to make the most of it.\nOne example showed a tie up with Manchester United in which live scores, statistics and ticker-tape was slickly added over smartphone footage of fans celebrating in a bar. Little practical use, maybe, but it sets up Facebook to be the home of the best augmented reality apps, accelerating at a pace Snapchat really can\u2019t match, if you ask me.\nHere\u2019s the thing: I really don\u2019t like Facebook Messenger. It\u2019s an app I\u2019d never want to use were it not attached to Facebook, which makes it kind-of unavoidable if I want to reach my friends. That said, I know many friends who have resisted adding it to their phones.\nDisturbingly, David Marcus, the head of Messenger, wants to bloat this app even further by adding in a host of new integrations, many designed to help you interact even more with businesses.\nBut I understand why. The model here is WeChat, the gigantic Chinese app that lets users do a bunch of things from within the same app. Facebook wants you use Messenger to chat to some friends about a night out and, without leaving Messenger, buy some gig tickets, make dinner reservations and book a ride-share.\nFor just idle chit-chat, Messenger is also being upgraded. Mr Marcus showed off a Spotify integration, where you can drop songs into group chat and all listen at once. Neat.\nMr Marcus admitted the excitement last year around bots (some of it from yours truly, I\u2019ll admit) never lived up to the hype. There are 100,000 bots on Messenger already, and so far none of them have been much cop (except this one from a 14-year-old boy).\nBut the Messenger boss is confident he\u2019s got the technology headed in the right direction. To me, it seems the \u201cchat\u201d is evolving from trying to sound human, to just conceding that swift multiple choice is much more useful to all (not to mention easier to code).\nFacebook\u2019s decision to buy Oculus VR was motivated by the possibility that the technology would become a social platform, and not just about gaming.\nFacebook Spaces is the first true embodiment of that. It places you, virtually, as a cartoony avatar, in a world inhabited by your other friends - also avatars. Here you can lark about, play games, share photos, take a \u201cselfie\u201d, even do a video call with someone in the \u201creal\u201d world.\nIt\u2019s a bit of silly fun. And I can already hear many of you reading this and saying \u201cHow sad! Be friends in the real world!\u201d. But hey, not everyone\u2019s friends are in visiting distance. And this is like a good Skype chat, and then some.\nThe barrier to entry, though, is still cost. To get this experience you need the Oculus Rift, which, if you don\u2019t already have a powerful-enough PC to hand, costs upwards of $1,000 (\u00a3780) to get going.\nWhich is why Facebook is working hard to make its PC-free, wireless, high-quality headset. Mark Zuckerberg brought that subject up again in his opening keynote, but didn\u2019t elaborate. I\u2019d hoped he might surprise everyone by showing it to us at the end of the keynote, but no such luck.\nFor Facebook Spaces to go mainstream, that headset needs to come out fast. And it needs to be less than $500. I\u2019m not holding my breath.\nThis one will sound boring, so I\u2019ve left it until last.\nFacebook announced that there would be a free version of Workplace, available by the end of this year.\nWorkplace is Facebook\u2019s answer to collaboration tool Slack and is, in direct contrast to Facebook itself, designed to help with productivity.\nRight now, the full version of Workplace is free. But later this year that will change, with a paid-for premium version, offering better admin tools and things like cloud file storage and sharing, and a free version with just the basics.\nYou may groan, but say what you like about Facebook, it is easy to use. And so having the company design the tools you use every day at work will be pretty appealing for many people, I\u2019m sure.\n___________\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\nYou can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370",

There has been a sense that it is never going to come and you're waiting and waiting.\nIt's a huge thing to be there. When we won our first three qualifying games people really began to think we can do this. Then you feel there is a lot to lose because you feel it is possible.\nSo to deliver qualification for the people of Northern Ireland was a huge achievement by the players. I'm delighted for the players who have had long careers and at times there have been difficult moments in those careers. Their loyalty alone has been rewarded by reaching Euro 2016.\nMy message to the players is this is an experience we all have to enjoy. We don't want to come away with regrets. I don't want the players burdened by expectation but they have to grasp this opportunity.\nLeicester won this season's Premier League at odds of 5,000-1. Northern Ireland, the outsiders along with Albania, are 500-1 to win Euro 2016.\nIt's amazing how football changes. In our third qualifier we beat Greece and Claudio Ranieri was the coach. He lost his job the following game. For him to come to the Premier League, at his stage of his career, and win it is an amazing achievement - the stuff of fairytales.\nThere are similarities between Leicester and Northern Ireland when you look at the route a lot of the Leicester players took to get to where they are. We have lads who are at Fleetwood Town [Vardy's previous club].\nIn terms of how we play there are similarities, too. Hopefully the neutrals will see a nice humility and work ethic about our team.\nWhile we're realistic enough to think we're not going to win the tournament, hopefully we get that level of support where we get a huge groundswell of people willing us to do well, which takes us as far as we can go.\nO'Neill managed Scottish third tier side Brechin City from April 2006 until December 2008, when he became Shamrock Rovers boss. He led the Dublin club to two Irish titles and to the group stages of the Europa League.\nHe left Rovers for the Northern Ireland job in December 2011 and recently signed a new four-year deal.\nI started my managerial career at the bottom. I had to go to a small club in Scotland who were part-time and I was working in financial services.\nI had an opportunity to go over to Shamrock Rovers. People thought that was a bit of a strange move but I felt it was a good opportunity.\nI didn't plan to be the national manager when it came around. I was 42 but I said to myself 'why not see where it takes me?'.\nIt's been a huge challenge. There were difficult times in the first two years but it taught me about perseverance. I probably underestimated the size of the job to progress things. But we have got where we are and it has been immensely rewarding for me.\nIt will be hard to top taking my country to a major finals whatever happens in my future career.\nNorthern Ireland open against Poland on 12 June, before playing Ukraine four days later and facing Germany on 21 June. With four third-placed teams going through to the last 16, one win might be enough.\nThe order of the fixtures is favourable to us. I'm glad we are playing Germany last because we could have been playing them earlier, had a really tough result and had to lift the players. At least we don't have to face that until the last group game.\nEven if we draw the first game, we go into the second game almost like a cup final and know if we win this game we will probably qualify.\nPoland is a tough game but when I look at qualification both Scotland and the Republic of Ireland drew with them. Robert Lewandowski is obviously a player that we are going to have to deal with but it is not beyond us to get a draw or a win.\nUkraine's strength is in their wide players - Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka. They narrowly got past Slovenia [in Euro 2016 play-off], who we beat in March. I spoke to Chris Coleman about Ukraine because his Wales team were beaten 1-0 by them in March. He said they were tough and physical. We'll have to match that.\nGermany had a bit of a hangover from the 2014 World Cup in qualification - losing to the Republic of Ireland and Poland. It will be a tough ask but when you go into a game like that you have everything to gain. Our aim is to have something to play for by the time we face them.\nBetween myself and one of my coaches who does the analysis, Austin MacPhee, we've watched the 10 qualification games of each of the countries in our group.\nI've seen Germany live and we've had Poland and Ukraine watched live whenever the opportunity existed in the recent friendly matches. One of our biggest strengths is the knowledge we have of the opposition.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI went to Poland and Ukraine for Euro 2012 and I felt the atmosphere in the stadiums was fantastic.\nI remember thinking it would be magical to come to something like this with Northern Ireland and now we're getting a chance to do it. It's going to be special.\nIt's been a huge few months. When you look at the scenes after the Greece game, it was euphoria. There's a generation of people in Northern Ireland who have never had the chance to see their country compete in a major tournament.\nThe excitement is tangible anywhere you go in Northern Ireland. It's hard not to feel it. Jumping in a taxi, the driver wants to talk about it. It's nice that we've created that.\nA lot of people talk about the spirit and the work-rate of the squad. But there's quality within that. Some players when they pull on a green shirt are able to lift themselves above the level they play club football.\nIt's not just spirit and togetherness that gets you to Euro 2016. We won our qualifying group by being the top scorers. We are a big threat at set-pieces, which is a big part of the game. The template that got us to France will hopefully stand us in good stead.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe last time Northern Ireland qualified for a major tournament was the 1986 World Cup, but it was their campaign in 1982 which lives in fans' memories - beating hosts Spain on the way to the knockout stages.\nI remember it vividly. I was 12, at home in Ballymena, watching on television. It was different then because there was not the amount of coverage on television as now.\nSo when the World Cup and European Championships came round it was huge. I remember Gerry Armstrong scoring, Mal Donaghy getting sent off and Pat Jennings playing amazingly well.\nNorthern Ireland were playing host nation Spain with 10 men and still won. It was just magical. That team achieved great things and that is the inspiration we will take for this tournament. We want to go to France and create our very own legacy.\nUnfortunately [manager for both those World Cups] Billy Bingham's health is not good at the minute - he has dementia. But I received congratulations and well wishes through his son when we qualified.\n[Golfer] Rory McIlroy has been in touch, so too boxer Carl Frampton, singer Gary Lightbody and actor Jimmy Nesbitt.\nAll the previous players have been very generous with their praise. Sammy McIlroy [who played for Northern Ireland in 1982 and 1986] was one of the first to call me up after we qualified.

They were not convinced that the wiping out of millions of retail jobs along with another area of human interaction was progress.\nIt seemed to reinforce the idea expressed by the noted technology thinker Om Malik in a recent New Yorker article, that Silicon Valley has an empathy vacuum. We've been speaking to Om who tells us that the Amazon Go concept is an example of the kind of technology that is now being invented without much thought - \"the speed with which change is happening is far ahead of our capabilities as human beings to deal with it\".\nHe thinks Silicon Valley needs to be rather more reflective about the impact its innovations are having on people who are fearful about the future - and he links this general anxiety about technology to the UK's Brexit vote and the rise of Donald Trump.\nWe've heard a lot on Tech Tent about a future where jobs are threatened by automation and artificial intelligence - but we assumed that was a distant threat. Suddenly it seems to be a very present worry for millions of people.\nHave you ever come across someone whose face you recognised but you couldn't remember their names? It's always happening to me.\nNow - as I reported earlier this week - there's an app for that. The augmented reality company Blippar already allows you to scan objects with your smartphone's camera to find out more about them - now you will be able to scan faces too.\nBut facial recognition software can be controversial - and this could be another of those innovations which sound great in a company brainstorming session but have unintended consequences in the real world. We hear from Blippar's co-founder Omar Tayeb who tells us how the app works - and why we shouldn't be worried about its implications for privacy.\nOur final story is about another area where the tech industry's reputation is coming into question - the proliferation of fake news stories spread over social networks and via Google searches.\nThe tech firms are now starting to respond with initiatives that could help readers understand what is true and what is not - but what can the traditional media firms do?\nOur reporter Jane Wakefield has been along to a hackathon where media organisations tried to work out what they could do to regain the trust of their audiences - and to show them that truth still matters:.\nWe hear from the Guardian, the UK's Mirror newspaper and Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics about how hard it is becoming in the online world to distinguish between news and propaganda. Ann Gripper from the Mirror argues that the problem now is that social media users get rewarded for sharing stories - fake or not.\nCritics of the mainstream media will argue with some justification that the problem started long before many people got their news online. So  whose job is it now  to decide what is true - and put clear markings on fake stories?  You might think that was the function of editors - but Alex Sander of the Guardian tells us \"it's the reader's job to mark things as fake\".",

They said they were looking for two people: a man called Amedy Coulibaly, 32, and a woman called Hayat Boumeddiene, 26.\nThe two were thought to be \"armed and dangerous\", French police said.\nThe Charlie Hebdo attackers, linked by intelligence officials to militant groups, shouted Islamist slogans during the shooting at the magazine office on Wednesday and then fled Paris in a hijacked car, heading north.\nShots were fired during a high-speed car chase earlier on Friday.\nIt appears the suspects had hijacked another car in the town of Montagny-Sainte-Felicite before travelling on to Dammartin.\nThe car's owner is said to have recognised them as the Kouachi brothers.\nIn a televised statement, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve confirmed the men being sought on Friday were those wanted for the Charlie Hebdo attack and said they would be \"neutralised\".\nThe suspects have been surrounded in a small printing business named CTD, a source close to the investigation told AFP.\nOfficials from the town council say pupils from three schools are being evacuated to a nearby gymnasium, where they will be reunited with their parents.\nChristelle Alleume, who works near CTD in Dammartin, said a round of gunfire had interrupted her morning coffee break.\n\"We heard shots and we returned very fast because everyone was afraid,\" she told French broadcaster iTele. \"We had orders to turn off the lights and not approach the windows.\"\nPeople in the area say police helicopters began arriving around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) followed by convoys of armed officers. Sharpshooters could be seen taking up position on rooftops.\nThe security situation has affected flights at the main airport in Paris, which is in the vicinity. Officials at Paris Charles de Gaulle say they have changed landing and take-off patterns for aircraft in the light of the security situation.\nIt is believed the Charlie Hebdo gunmen were angered by the satirical magazine's irreverent depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.\nDuring the attack on Charlie Hebdo, the attackers are said to have shouted \"We are al-Qaeda, Yemen\", an apparent reference to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP).\nIn the US, a senior official has told reporters that one of the two brothers alleged to have carried out the attack, Said Kouachi, spent \"a few months\" training in Yemen with the group.\nSaid and his younger brother, convicted terrorist Cherif Kouachi, were on a US no-fly list before the attack, a US counter-terrorism official told the New York Times.\nFrance's main Muslim federations have called on imams at 2,300 French mosques to \"condemn the violence and the terrorism with maximum firmness\".\nThe victims\nObituary: Defiant editor\nA mosque and a kebab shop in Paris were attacked on Thursday. There were no injuries.\nPresident Francois Hollande called for tolerance, saying France had been \"struck directly in the heart of its capital, in a place where the spirit of liberty and thus of resistance breathed freely\".\n\"Reassuring the population is telling them that they live in a state run by the rule of law and which has the will to be together, to refuse one-upmanship, stigmatisation and caricatures,\" he said.\nThe lawyer for Charlie Hebdo, Richard Malka, has said that next week's edition of the magazine will go ahead on Wednesday and will have a print run of one million instead of the normal 60,000 copies.\n\"It's very hard. We are all suffering, with grief, with fear, but we will do it anyway because stupidity will not win,\" columnist Patrick Pelloux said.",

That would require the equivalent of opening one new coal mine every month until the end of this decade.\nIndia's need for coal is driven by the huge numbers who do not have electricity, estimated to be around 300 million people.\nIn these negotiations the government has adopted a hard line, saying that the need to develop using fossil fuels trumps the needs of the climate.\nIn recent days, the Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told BBC News that his country had every right to continue using as much coal as it needed.\n\"We are increasing our renewable targets tenfold in the next 15 years but we will require coal because it is the need of the hour for my people to grow.\"\nBut on Wednesday, Dr Mathur, a senior negotiator in the Indian delegation, adopted a much more conciliatory line.\nHe argues that the cost of solar, which has declined by 75% in 4 years, is still double the cost of coal.\nIf cash was provided to make the capital investments in renewables cheaper, India would use more sun and wind, and less coal.\n\"We look forward to an agreement that enables financial support from the countries that have developed on the backs of cheap energy, to those who have to meet their energy with more expensive but low carbon energy,\" Dr Mathur said.\nWhen asked if the amount of coal that India consumed would reduce if more money was available from a Paris deal, he replied: \"Absolutely.\n\"We are very clear that solar and wind is our first commitment, hydro and nuclear all of these non-carbon sources are what we will develop to the largest extent we can.\n\"What cannot be met by these will be met by coal.\"\nThe Indian delegation would be pushing for a \"just and sustainable agreement\" here in Paris, Dr Mathur said.\nDevelopment was still the main aim for India. But the country had to find a different way of doing it, even compared to the greenest European countries, he said.\n\"What I am truly fearful about is say if India moves onto a path of Denmark, and even has two cars for 10 people, we will be swamped. Even the Denmark paradigm does not work for us.\"\nUS lead negotiator Todd Stern said the Indian statement was encouraging.\n\"We support the notion of India greatly increasing [renewables]. Prime Minister Modi has made pledges that are quite enormously impressive actually with respect to the development of renewable energy, the total of what he has pledged is 175 gigawatts in a very short period,\" he told a news conference.\n\"We provide assistance to India, we invest in India, many other countries do, we certainly want to work with our Indian partners to encourage and to help, exactly what they are trying to do and do our best to help them realise that.\"\nChina has also announced steps to upgrade many power plants in an effort to clean up the air and reduce carbon, according to the the official Xinhua news agency, quoting the State Council.\nAny coal stations that do not meet the new standard by 2020 will be shut down, the agency reported.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.\nCOP 21 - the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties - will see more than 190 nations gather in Paris to discuss a possible new global agreement on climate change, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the threat of dangerous warming due to human activities.\nExplained: What is climate change?\nIn video: Why does the Paris conference matter?\nAnalysis: Latest from BBC environment correspondent Matt McGrath\nMore: BBC News climate change special report",

Workers are being balloted on the changes.\nThe firm has been in discussion with the government for a loan of between \u00a370m and \u00a3100m.\nThose discussions are thought to be continuing but it is understood the sale is not dependent upon the loan.\nThe turnaround plan was drawn up by management at Scunthorpe with input from unions and refined by the management consultants McKinsey & Co.\nIt is understood Greybull is not envisaging further restructuring beyond the 1,200 job losses announced last October.\nThat involved the closure of one of the two coke ovens at Scunthorpe and the mothballing of three plate mills, reducing annual production capacity to 2.8m tonnes.\nTwo of those Mills, in Lanarkshire in Scotland, have been sold to Liberty House, the commodities company which has expressed an interest in buying Tata's other UK steel operations, including the Port Talbot steelworks.\nThe sale could also see the business rebranded as \"British Steel\", as it is understood Greybull is seeking to buy the brand as part of the deal.\n\"British Steel\" was the name of Britain's privatised steel industry.  It disappeared in 1999 when the industry was merged with a Dutch rival to create the Corus Group.\nThe new business would include the Scunthorpe works, two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York and distribution facilities.\nAbout 3,400 employees are based in Scunthorpe with a further thousand spread across the other sites. The business also has a mill in northern France employing 400 workers.\nThe business makes products for the transport and construction sectors with customers including the equipment giant Caterpillar and Network Rail.\nIt is thought to have a 90% share of the market for new rails used across Britain's railways.\nThe mill in northern France also produces rails for the national railway operator SNCF and for customers in Western Europe.\nGreybull specialises in turning around struggling firms by taking controlling stakes and backing management teams.\nIn 2014 it rescued the holiday airline Monarch, buying a 90% stake. The airline returned to profitability the following year.\nLast September it bought 140 Morrisons convenience stores, rebranding them as My Local.\nIt also owns Plessey, another name from Britain's industrial past, and is seeking to turn it into a leader in LED technology.\nBut its purchase of Tata's loss-making long products division is its most high profile deal yet.\nBut this sale, which could come as early as Monday, is not yet a done deal.\nIt is expected to be subject to some outstanding conditions, thought to include financing and supplier agreements, which may mean it will not be formally completed for weeks.\nGreybull has made it clear that its focus at this time is on the long products purchase.\nYou can follow John on twitter on @JohnMoylanBBC",

Meteorologists report that weather conditions should be good.\nThe Long March will put Tiangong in a near-circular path around the Earth, just a few hundred km above the surface.\nIt will operate in an autonomous mode, monitored from the ground. Then, in a few weeks' time, China will launch another unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou 8, and try to link the pair together.\nThis rendezvous and docking capability is a prerequisite if larger structures are ever to be assembled in orbit.\nCommentators say Russian technology, or a close copy of it, will be used to bring the two craft into line.\nAssuming the venture goes well, two manned missions (Shenzhou 9 and 10) should follow in 2012. The yuhangyuans - two or three at a time - are expected to live aboard the conjoined vehicles for up to two weeks.\nTiangong means \"heavenly palace\" in Chinese. The programme is the second step in what Beijing authorities describe as a three-step strategy.\nThe first step was the development of the Shenzhou capsule system which has so far permitted six nationals to go into orbit since 2003; then the technologies needed for spacewalking and docking, now in progress; and finally construction of the space station.\nAt about 60 tonnes in mass, this future station would be considerably smaller than the 400-tonne international platform operated by the US, Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan, but its mere presence in the sky would nonetheless represent a remarkable achievement.\nConcept drawings describe a core module weighing some 20-22 tonnes, flanked by two slightly smaller laboratory vessels.\nOfficials say it would be supplied by freighters in exactly the same way that robotic cargo ships keep the International Space Station (ISS) today stocked with fuel, food, water, air, and spare parts.\nThere has been much talk about China becoming involved in the ISS project itself, and the fact that it has adopted many Russian engineering standards would certainly make it technically possible for Shenzhou vehicles to visit the orbiting complex.\nEurope, too, has argued that additional partners could help spread the cost of running what is an extremely expensive endeavour.  But political differences between China and the US would appear to make such involvement unlikely in the near-term.\n\"These are decisions that have to be taken by the whole ISS partnership; everyone has to agree,\" says Karl Bergquist from the European Space Agency's (Esa) international relations department.\n\"You also have to see whether it is something which would interest a country like China, given their ambitions in space.  They have advanced so far in their plans that they will probably go ahead and develop their own station,\" he told BBC News.\nThomas Reiter, the director of human spaceflight at Esa, was asked to comment on the status of China's space programme during a seminar this month at the London School of Economics.\n\"I think the Chinese want to prove to themselves and others that they are on a level,\" he said.  \"At that point, it becomes a moment for discussion on greater co-operation. We are certainly drifting towards each other.\"\nThe director said he could envisage the day when yuhangyuans made visits to European astronaut training facilities.\nCurrently, most of Europe's engagement with China falls in the area of space science.\nEsa participated in the Double Star mission, a pair of satellites sent into orbit to study the Sun's interaction with the Earth's magnetic field.\nThere is also co-operative work in Earth observation, assisting the Chinese with the development of applications to interpret satellite data.\nIn the UK, manufacturer Surrey Satellite Technology Limited announced recently that it would be making three high-resolution imaging spacecraft for the purpose of mapping China.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk",

        "source_text": "But as global landmarks and Facebook feeds turned into a bunting of Tricolores, some were left asking; what about the more than 60 people who perished in suicide attacks in Beirut and Baghdad just days before? What about the people of Syria, for whom the threat of death by bullet or blast, rebels or regime is part of everyday life?\nThe Paris attack was shocking and devastating. At the same time, it was a single event in an ongoing conflict which has become centred on Syria and Iraq but is being waged across the globe.\nBBC Monitoring has used world media reporting on deaths involving at least one identifiable jihadist group to build a sense of the toll that conflict with Sunni Islamist extremists is taking. Our analysis considered events between the downing of the Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October and the attack on the Radisson hotel in Bamako, Mali on 22 November.\nAs well as jihadist attacks, we also looked at reported casualties from operations carried out against such groups.\nObtaining reliable casualty figures from conflict zones in is near impossible, as is determining the groups responsible for every attack. But BBC Monitoring's access to a broad range of global media sources allows us to get a sense of the scale of the bloodshed. The figures we quote do not represent a comprehensive account of the human cost of this conflict, but are intended to help place the Paris attacks into a global context.\nDuring the period, 707 deaths from identifiable attacks by jihadists were recorded.\nSuicide or car bombings in Baghdad are an almost daily occurrence. The data show 59 recorded deaths from these incidents, 26 of which occurred on the same day as the Paris attacks.\nAt least 546 deaths were directly attributable to attacks by IS and its affiliates, including Nigeria's Boko Haram and Wilayat Sina, who claimed responsibility for the Russian plane bombing. The actual figure is likely to be considerably higher, given the paucity of reliable reporting from areas under IS control, and a large number of attacks which are suspected, but not verifiably attributable to the group.\nThe Nigerian IS-affiliate known as Boko Haram, which last year killed more people than its parent outfit in Syria, staged at least eight attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad, killing more than 75 people, mostly civilians.\nAttacks attributed to al-Qaeda and its affiliates accounted for at least 135 deaths in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, including the Bamako hotel siege.\nAl-Shabab were the most prolific al-Qaeda affiliate, carrying out at least 17 attacks and killing more than 90 people, including civilians, soldiers and government officials. Several members lost their lives as a result of an internal dispute over whether the group should switch allegiance to Islamic State.\nFrance's response to the Paris attacks was to intensify operations against IS targets. This was in addition to air strikes being carried out by a US-led coalition and Russia, and ground operations conducted by forces in Iraq and Syria. Military operations are also being conducted against Boko Haram in West Africa and the Taliban in South Asia.\nOur research shows that well more than 1,000 jihadists were killed during the period, but additional data indicate more than 80 civilian deaths in such operations, although this is difficult to verify. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 400 civilians were killed by Russian strikes alone between September and November.\nLast year, BBC Monitoring, World Service and Kings College London collaborated on a project to count the number of deaths resulting from jihadist attacks over a 30-day period.\nThe data showed that the perceived decline of jihadist violence in the wake of Osama Bin-Laden's death was an illusion. In fact, the threat had increased, as exemplified by the spectacular rise of IS.\nA total of 664 jihadist attacks and 5,042 deaths were recorded for the month of November 2014. This year's snapshot suggests that the phenomenon still shows no sign of abating. Iraq, Syria, Nigeria and Afghanistan remain the most dangerous countries, but their neighbours are also now increasingly at risk.\nMuslims remain by far the biggest victims of terrorist attacks.\nAnd the high profile attacks on Paris and the Russian airliner show that citizens of nations involved in operations against jihadist groups continue to be targeted.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

You need a jazz quartet of them to achieve full human intelligence,\" Prof Claxton says.\nWhen it comes to governments and prime ministers, this failure of intelligence creates the need for ways of stopping power getting out of hand like the House of Lords checking the power of the House of Commons.\nWhen individuals are in positions of great power, there are other dangers, he says.\n\"Politics can become dangerous. Leaders have the power to create wars.\"\nWhen the rest of the world makes it known that they do not like this type of leadership, they tend to resort to something which Prof Claxton calls 'messianic hubris'.\n\"They transpose their leadership into a sense of humility, as if they are listening to an inner god or higher power when making decisions.\"\nThis is when self-deception and an inflated sense of self-worth sets in.\nTo combat against this, a sense of humour is a useful tool, Prof Claxton says.\n\"Traditionally, powerful people had a joker following them around, making jokes and poking fun at them, reminding them that they are just human beings.\"\nThis suggests that a reminder of your own fallibility is necessary when you are a leader in any field.\nAnother danger for powerful people is a potential lack of empathy for others, a subject also discussed at the Royal Society of Medicine conference.\nNeuroscience studies have shown that the human brain responds to seeing someone in pain by activating pain in its own nerve endings, in order to mirror their pain.\nFurther research in this area suggests that if one person does not like another, for whatever reason, then feelings of empathy are less likely.\nDr Jamie Ward, reader in psychology at the University of Sussex, says that power has the same effect.\n\"You are less likely to imitate a low-status person if you are high status because you are unlikely to recognise or empathise with them. That could mean that the powerful are less empathetic.\"\nThe Royal Society of Medicine conference, entitled The Intoxication of Power: From neurosciences to hubris in healthcare and public life, takes place on Tuesday, 9 October 2012.",

        "source_text": "She's been accused of shamelessly attaching herself to the footballers and their success, and the polls have shown upward blips of support for her as the team has progressed. But will it last?\nThere's no doubt the World Cup has played well for her. Within an hour of the final whistle, there seemed to be a million tweets of her pictured in the middle of the sweaty, victorious team holding the trophy, the president of Germany beside her.\nShe is, by all accounts, a genuine football fan, going to games way before she was politically important. But nowadays the right picture in the right place doesn't do any harm either.\nShe was there when Germany thrashed Portugal 4-0 at the start and she was there at the final triumph when they lifted the World Cup.\nShe's been described as the team's lucky charm.  As she and the team's supporters sometimes put it: \"Our twelfth man is a woman.\"\nBut the political benefits of sporting success are not clear - or rather, they are complex and memory plays tricks.\nIt is one of the great myths of British politics, for example, that the victory of England in the World Cup of 1966 kept Labour in government.\nThe story runs thus:  Labour and the Conservatives were running neck-and-neck in the election opinion polls and then Geoff Hurst knocked in a hat-trick.\nThe fans, also known as voters, duly rewarded Harold Wilson at the ballot box and kept him in Number 10.\nThere's one problem with this oft-quoted canard:  the election preceded the World Cup Final. Labour beat the Conservatives on 31 March and England beat West Germany on 30 July.\nThe \"feel-good factor\" from victory on the field can't have translated into political success.\nBut it may have been true four years later.  In 1970 in Mexico, England were dumped out of the contest far earlier than expected.\nIt was the manner of defeat that hit so hard: England were 2-0 up against West Germany in a quarter-final with 22 minutes to go and over-confident manager Alf Ramsey substituted players to keep them fresh for the inevitable semi-final - except that the Germans then scored three (two in normal time and one in extra-time).\nLess than a week later, in a great political upset, Labour and Wilson were dumped out of office.\nWilson said sport was not a factor, but a string of memoirs by his cabinet colleagues at the time revealed that he had been worried about how the World Cup would affect his chances of being substituted out of Downing Street.\nBut this is all conjecture. There has been much pontification on the link between politics and sport but not much hard evidence.\nOne piece of serious academic research indicated that whatever benefit there might be to a nation and its politicians from sporting success was negligible.\nGeorgios Kavetsos of the London School of Economics and Stefan Szymanski, now of the University of Michigan, crunched the numbers.\nThey used measures of happiness for 12 Western European countries from 1974 to 2004 to see if they correlated with sporting success for those countries. They did not.\nBut they did find a correlation between measures of happiness and hosting sporting events.\nThe academics looked at eight separate tournaments: the World Cup in France (1998) and Italy (1990), the European football championships in Italy (1980), France (1984), West Germany (1988), England (1996) and Belgium/the Netherlands (2000).\nThey found that happiness indices rose in all but one of these countries.\nThe exception was England, but the measurement wasn't quite comparable - happiness was measured for the United Kingdom not just for England and, strange to say, the happiness of the Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish might not move in the same direction as that of the English.\nIt would be too harsh to say that the happier the English, the more miserable the others, but you get the drift. Either way, the British exception in the study might prove the rule.\nThe upshot of this research is that Angela Merkel is unlikely to get a great political benefit from the victory of Germany on the field.\nShe is already widely approved of in the polls and a picture of her with other successful people may just reinforce that image. Think of how an unpopular politician would be greeted if he or she attempted to piggyback on the success of a team.\nBut the research does indicate that the host country for a big sporting event becomes happier by doing so, however the country's team performs on the field.\nAs Kavetsos and Szymanski put it: \"We find that the 'feelgood' factor associated with hosting football events is large and significant, but that the impact of national athletic success on happiness, while correctly signed, is statistically insignificant.\"\nIn which case, the big gainer from this World Cup would be Brazil.\nIt seems paradoxical to say this after the country's football side was thrashed and then thrashed again, with much booing by the fans.\nDespite that, the sheer experience of togetherness and achievement in holding the event might bring an increase in happiness. So implies the research.\nStep forward the true winners: Brazil.",

Even his body language looks much better, because he clearly doesn't want to be tracking back and chasing full-backs into his own half - all of his energy should be used for the creative side he is so good at.\nBut to play Griezmann in that number 10 role, Deschamps will have to stick with the 4-2-3-1 formation he used against Iceland - rather than the 4-3-3 he had favoured previously in this tournament.\nTo do that, he will have to leave out one of his holding midfielders - N'Golo Kante, who was suspended last time out, Paul Pogba or Blaise Matuidi.\nWith France up against Germany, I think that Kante has to play in this game. He would actually be my first choice ahead of Pogba or Matuidi.\nHis ability to break up play and cover his back four will be crucial against Germany because Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil will always look to get in those pockets of space behind the France midfield and in front of their defence.\nKante's awareness, speed and work-rate means he will be excellent at dealing with that. For me, he should play whatever selection and shape Deschamps decides upon.\nI have a feeling he will go back to 4-3-3, which will be more solid, and only go to a more attacking shape when they need to - most managers would do this.\nMost managers would do that, but I would personally be tempted to pick Kante and Pogba and leave Matuidi out because, although he is very effective at what he does, he is the least gifted of the three.\nThat way Deschamps can play 4-2-3-1 and use Griezmann centrally, and really play on the front foot.\nIf France let Germany have too much of the ball and dictate play then we have seen what they can do, but if they have a go at them then there are definitely areas where they can hurt the world champions.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGermany changed their shape to play Italy, going with three centre-halves to match the Italians' formation.\nI would imagine they will go back to playing four across the back in Marseille, because the French play that way and Germany prefer it anyway.\nMats Hummels is suspended but I don't think that is too big a blow because they have Shkodran Mustafi to come in alongside Jerome Boateng at the back. The Valencia defender played instead of Hummels in their opening game against Ukraine - when Hummels was also suspended - and scored.\nTheir manager Joachim Low is not exactly struggling in midfield either, even without Sami Khedira.\nBut, up front, Mario Gomez is a big miss. They have definitely been better at this tournament when he has been on the pitch because he is a physical presence and a focal point for them.\nGomez is a big powerful striker and, when he plays, they do not have to play their way through - they can knock balls up to him and he can feed their runners into the box.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn Olivier Giroud, France have got a striker who performs that Gomez role and does just as much for his team.\nYes he has spells where he struggles in front of goal, but overall his contribution is always positive. He has his critics, for Arsenal and his national side, but he is very good at ignoring them and just cracking on.\nHis best quality is his perseverance. He never hides, he just keeps trying to do the right things in the right areas and, when he is used correctly he is perfect because he knows exactly how to play his role - stay high up the pitch, occupy the two centre-halves and be strong on the ball.\nIn terms of build-up play and giving you the right options I always thought that, as a midfielder, I would really enjoy playing with him.\nI understand why Arsenal fans want a striker who will get you 25 goals a season instead, but he is not that prolific a player.\nJudge him for what he gives the team instead, and the fact he always gives his all and is reliable. If France are to beat Germany, he will play a big part even if he does not get on the scoresheet.\nIf I was to pick a winner then Gomez's absence certainly swings the momentum to France, but it is going to be such a close game.\nGermany's quarter-final against Italy went to penalties and could have gone either way, which will give the French encouragement because they have got more flair and creativity than the Italians.\nDeschamps and his players have also got belief and a spring in their step after the way they defeated Iceland but they remain vulnerable defensively and Germany are patient, strong and methodical.\nThe world champions have looked full of confidence since the tournament started - they always do - and they have improved as it has gone on.\nMy football brain still thinks France should beat them but the way Germany are makes it impossible to bet against them.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan in France.",

Mr Miller's brother said justice had now \"been delivered\".\nMiss Witheridge's family said they needed time \"to digest the outcome of the trial verdict\".\nAt a Thai court in Koh Samui, three judges found the two bar workers - who were migrants from Myanmar - guilty of murder and ordered they face the death penalty.\nMiss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found on a beach having been bludgeoned to death, and a post-mortem examination showed Miss Witheridge had been raped.\nProsecutors said DNA evidence collected from cigarette butts, a condom and the bodies of the victims, linked Lin and Phyo to the deaths.\nBy Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent\nThe investigation has been a muddled affair.\nThe first officers on the scene were local police with apparently no idea how to seal off a crime scene.\nThailand forensic scientist Dr Pornthip Rojanasunand, whose institute was not allowed any involvement in the investigation, testified the crime scene had been poorly managed and evidence improperly collected.\nOther flaws exposed during the trial included the police's failure to test Miss Witheridge's clothes or the alleged murder weapon for DNA.\nThe key question though, hung over one piece of evidence that did tie the defendants to the crime: the alleged match between their DNA and that recovered from semen found on Miss Witheridge's body.\nThe date of the original DNA analysis was said to have been 17 September, but the report submitted to court was dated 5 October - two days after police had announced a positive match. That unexplained discrepancy inevitably raises suspicion that perhaps the result was manipulated.\nRead more from Jonathan: A flawed and muddled investigation\nLawyers defending the accused argued DNA from a garden hoe - allegedly used as the murder weapon - did not match samples taken from the men.\nThey also claimed evidence had been mishandled by police and the pair's confessions were the result of \"systematic abuse\" of migrants in the area.\nAndy Hall, international affairs adviser for Migrant Worker Rights Network, which represented the men, said: \"We strongly disagree with the decision of the court. This investigation was a shambles from the beginning.\n\"The defence team have had access to all the information in this case and the information we saw did not comply with international standards.\"\nHe said the defence team would mount an appeal in the case.\nHannah Witheridge, 23, was a University of Essex student from Hemsby, near Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.\nHaving earned a degree with first-class honours from the University of East Anglia she was working towards a masters degree in speech and language therapy in Essex. Her parents Tony and Sue, brother Paul and sisters Tania and Laura, described her as a \"fun, vibrant and beautiful young woman\" who had a love for animals.\nThe University of Essex has introduced an award for outstanding excellence in clinical placements in her memory. She \"would have gone on to make a significant difference to the lives of many people\", her family said.\nDavid Miller, 24, from Jersey, had just completed a civil and structural engineering degree at the University of Leeds. He was described as a \"bright, young man and a talented artist\".\nHis friends and family held a memorial and commissioned a \"simple seat from a plank of oak from a tree that fell in the great storm of 1987... This tree was another tower of Jersey strength brought crashing down before its time\", they said.\nHis parents, Ian and Susan, and his brother Michael said: \"Our 24 years of memories and his beaming smile will always be cherished. David was intelligent, hard-working, he was caring, inclusive, enthusiastic and fun. He irreplaceable to us.\"\nFamilies talk of 'senseless' killings\nThe victims met on Koh Tao while staying in the same hotel.\nThe family of Mr Miller attended the hearing but relatives of Miss Witheridge did not travel to Thailand for the verdicts.\nHer family said the verdict had left them \"in the path of a whirlwind of emotions and difficulties\".\nIn a statement they said: \"The past year has served as an unimaginably impossible time for our family. We have found the trial process extremely difficult and our trips out to Thailand, to attend court, made for particularly distressing experiences.\n\"We found listening to proceedings very challenging and we have had to endure a lot of painful and confusing information. We now need time, as a family, to digest the outcome of the trial and figure out the most appropriate way to tell our story.\"\nSpeaking outside court, Mr Miller's brother Michael said: \"We believe the result today represents justice for David and Hannah.\n\"It is our opinion that the evidence against Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin is absolutely overwhelming. They raped to satisfy their selfish desires and murdered to cover up that fact. They have shown no remorse during the trial.\"\nHe said the Thai police investigation was \"not the so-called shambles it was made out to be\".\nMr Miller acknowledged that initially when Lin and Phyo were brought forward as suspects, the family was unsure.\n\"We saw images of two innocent-looking men surrounded by tough policemen. It was easy to conclude they might be convenient scapegoats.\n\"We believe that, after a difficult start, the Royal Thai police conducted a methodical and thorough investigation.\"\nHe added: \"We hope the campaigners who have relentlessly promoted this case will respect the process of law and the decision of the court.\n\"[David] was hacked down from behind, dragged into the sea and left to die. That will live with us forever,\" he said.  He also paid tribute to relatives of Miss Witheridge for the \"horrors they are also enduring with such dignity\".\n\"Our lives have been changed forever.\"",

We gave Villa the belief that they could get a better result. In the end, we were by far the better team.

        "source_text": "The Wales audit office has sat on the fence, but as ever with reports from the public spending watchdog, it gives a fascinating account of what was going on behind the scenes in the most talked about acquisition by Welsh government ministers in recent years.\nIn July 2011, the Spanish owners Abertis had asked for \u00a3200m when Carwyn Jones flew to Barcelona which strongly suggests it wasn't interested in selling, or as the report puts it, in characteristically dry language: \"Officials felt that the price suggested was so unrealistically high as to be a total rebuttal of the Welsh government's approach.\"\nSomething is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it, and a year later Abertis told Welsh government officials it was prepared to enter into formal negotiations if the price was close to between \u00a356m and \u00a358m.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                That is, presumably, why the Welsh government made an unbinding offer of up to \u00a355m in December 2012.\nIt appears to be a remarkable coincidence then that three months later, after numerous projections and valuations, the eventual agreed price was \u00a355m (or \u00a352m plus \u00a33m cash). This is something the assembly's public accounts committee will be exploring in its inquiry in the coming weeks.\nIn fact the report says: \"The Welsh government's prime concern was that Abertis would withdraw from negotiations if a revised offer was made that was significantly lower than the non-binding offer that the Welsh government had made in December 2012.\"\nThe key question is whether that price was justified on the commercial terms required for EU state aid purposes?\nThe striking point is that at the time that the unbinding offer was made in December 2012, there was only one initial valuation on the table from the Welsh government's accountants KPMG, and it was between \u00a325 and \u00a335m.\nNot only did government officials ignore that valuation, but instead struck a provisional deal with Abertis which was up to double that amount.\nKPMG actually updated its valuation in February 2013 to an even lower figure of between \u00a320m and \u00a330m.\nOfficials felt KPMG's assessment was too low and put another bid in to Abertis of \u00a341m, which was rejected by the company.\nWelsh government officials then asked KPMG to work up a range of new valuations based on a range of scenarios prepared by an aviation consultancy.\nThe results varied from between \u00a330m to \u00a380m, but crucially KPMG was told to base the valuations on future profits as officials felt this better reflected the potential of the airport than one based mainly on historic under-performance.\nIt's worth remembering that KPMG's initial valuation of \u00a325 to \u00a335m reflected what the report called the airport's \"weak performance relative to historic levels and the low current profitability compared with future profit levels forecast by Abertis.\"\nSo it's clear that the focus on the future, rather than the past, made significant differences in the valuations.\nThe engineering consultancy Arup then were commissioned to follow this up with a review of the valuation evidence, and identified a figure of \u00a355m, which was the eventual price agreed on.\nSo it's clear that there was an initial disagreement between KPMG and the officials on what the airport was worth, and opposition parties have seized on this as evidence that the Welsh government paid too much.\nBut this isn't the full story because there are much higher valuations if the airport is considered a public asset, rather than as a straight commercial operation.\nIt's on this basis that the First Minister is on stronger political ground. He can point to a significant growth in passenger numbers and destinations.\nHe says he believed the airport would have closed, and in so doing threatening the 1,600 jobs at the British Airways Maintenance Centre on the same site.\nHe can't prove that but he can point to a lack of investment by the Spanish owners and it's clear to anyone who has gone to the airport recently that it's now in a far better position than it was a few years ago.\nAnd it's those arguments he'll be using to persuade others that in this case the market was failing, and state intervention was required.",

They had been introduced to each other by their parents and were to be engaged when violence broke out in 1947.\nThe troubled subcontinent was lurching towards a bloody partition as it split into the new independent nations of India and Pakistan. Communal violence erupted, leaving more than a million people dead and displacing tens of millions.\nPunjab was divided - western, mostly Muslim, parts went to Pakistan and eastern, mainly Hindu and Sikh parts, went to India. The newly-engaged man and woman were Sikhs living in what is now Pakistan.\nThe jacket and the briefcase were their most valuable possessions as they fled their homes to escape death as communities butchered each other in a prolonged frenzy of religious rioting.\nThree of Bhagwan Singh Maini's brothers had already been slaughtered in the violence, so the 30-year-old man stuffed his certificates and property claims in the fraying briefcase and fled his home in Mianwali.\nMore than 250km (155 miles) away, in Gujranwala, Pritam Kaur's family slipped out of their house and put her on a train to Amritsar.\nMs Kaur, 22, travelled across the blood-stained border with her two-year-old brother on her lap. In her bag was her most precious possession, the phulkari [embroidered] jacket, a reminder of happier days.\nTorn apart by what turned out to be the greatest mass migration - or transfer of population - in human history,  the two landed up in teeming refugee camps that dotted Amritsar city. They were among the more than 15 million people who had crossed the new borders.\nOne day, in the food line, a miracle happened.\nBoth Mr Maini and Ms Kaur had joined the queue of bedraggled, hungry refugees. There, they met again.\n\"They exchanged notes about their tragedies, wondering if it was destiny that had brought them together once more. Their families, or whatever was left of them, also reunited in due course,\" says Cookie Maini, daughter-in-law of Bhagwan Singh Maini.\nIn March 1948, the two got married. It was an austere ceremony; both families were struggling to pick up the pieces.\nMs Kaur wore her favourite jacket. Mr Maini got together his certificates and papers from his briefcase to start a new life: he joined the judicial service in Punjab, got a small house in compensation and moved to Ludhiana with Ms Kaur.\nThe couple had two children, who both served as civil servants. Mr Maini died some 30 years ago; Ms Kaur died in 2002.\n\"The jacket and the briefcase,\" says Ms Maini, \"are testimony to the life they lost and found together.\"\nThey now survive as two of the most valuable possessions of India's fledgling Partition Museum, which is being prepared in Amritsar.\nBy early next year, the museum, housed in the magnificent and restored Town Hall, will showcase photographs, letters, audio-recordings, belongings of refugees, official documents and maps and rare newspaper clippings relating to the event.\n\"This will be the most comprehensive archive on the partition, and the only museum of its kind in the world,\" says Manika Ahluwalia, chief executive officer of the two-floor, 17,000 sq ft Partition Museum.\nThere are the stark black-and-white pictures of the never-ending caravan of Hindu and Muslim refugees, trudging wearily to what will be their new homes. Bullock carts overflow with sparse belongings and withered humans. Some 10 million refugees were on the move; one single convoy was reported to have stretched for 10 miles.\nTrains awash with the blood of murdered refugees steamed across the new borders. Too few police and soldiers were deployed to check the ensuing violence. Historian Ramachandra Guha says the \"protection of British lives was made the first priority\". Women wore the brunt of the violence: tens of thousands were abducted, though many were eventually recovered.\nTent cities sprouted all over the country to house the displaced farmers, artisans, government workers, traders and labourers. By 1950, there were some 200,000 refugees in squatter colonies in the eastern city of Calcutta alone.\nRefugees abandoned millions of hectares of their own farm land and many received scanty compensation: a widow who lost her husband's 11,500 acres of land in two districts which went to Pakistan was given 835 acres in a village in Indian Punjab.\nMonths after the event, the bloodbath was still continuing. The front page of a Punjab-based newspaper in October paints a picture of utter despair and anarchy in the state.\nArmed mobs were attacking villages, towns were plunged into darkness, there is a story about the \"moon coming to the rescue of millions\" after a power outage as well as accounts of a cholera outbreak , floods and details about millions of people stranded in refugee camps awaiting evacuation.\n\"Life here continues to be nightmarish,\" wrote India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in October 1947. \"Everything seems to have gone awry\".\nUntil you hear - and see evidence - of stories of hope and redemption, of lives lost and recovered, as in case of Bhagwan Singh Maini and Pritam Kaur.\nWith these stories and more, the museum in Amritsar hopes to remind people of an event which author Sunil Khilnani described as \"the unspeakable sadness at the heart of the idea of India\".\nPioneering Indians is part of the India Direct series.

One key advantage, Intel says, is that users will be able to see their own hands.\nIt intends to offer the technology to other manufactures next year, but will not sell the headsets itself.\nThe company is keen to avoid repeating the mistake it made with smartphones.\nThe California-based company has previously acknowledged that it botched an opportunity to supply Apple with chips for its original iPhone.\nIt subsequently lost out to rival ARM-based technology that now powers the vast majority of handsets.\nProject Alloy marks an opportunity to pitch its RealSense depth-sensing cameras, Replay graphics-creation software and other proprietary inventions to others before virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices - which superimpose graphics over a real-world view - go mainstream.\nEven so, it is far from being the only technology giant involved in the sector:\nFurthermore, AMD - a rival chipmaker to Intel - is developing an untethered headset of its own that mixes together AR and VR technologies.\nIntel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, offered a first look at Project Alloy at his company's developer forum in San Francisco, where he suggested the technology could \"redefine what is possible with computing\".\nOne of the benefits of its approach, he said, was that the headset's RealSense cameras could detect a user's finger movements and allow them to appear in a virtual world and manipulate simulated objects.\n\"Merged reality is about more natural ways of interacting with and manipulating virtual environments,\" he said in a blog later published on Medium.\n\"[That liberates] you from the controllers and the nunchucks of today's VR systems by immersing your hands - your real-life hands - into your simulated experiences.\"\nIn an on-stage demonstration, the hands could be seen only if they were held near to the centre of the user's field of view.\nWhen Mr Krzanich's own face appeared within the VR world, it also became apparent that \"merged reality\" objects only appeared as low resolution graphics, at least for now.\nHe added that the technology had benefits over rival systems that required a user to install external sensors in their room to detect their movements.\nAnd he suggested that going wireless would prevent an owner being \"jolted\" out of their experience because they had reached the limit of the cord used to transmit data from a PC or games console.\nHowever, he acknowledged that one trade-off would be that the computer involved would take slightly longer to respond to a user's actions - something that might concern gamers.\nMicrosoft has pledged to support the headset in a forthcoming version of Windows 10.\nOne expert said Project Alloy had promise, but it might only have limited appeal.\n\"Having a real-time rendition of your hands or other objects in VR could have appeal to enterprise applications, such as a surgeon training with a body diagram or a mechanic having graphics overlaid onto an engine part,\" said Ed Barton, from the technology consultancy Ovum.\n\"But when it comes to gaming, there hasn't been much clamour to be able to see your hands in real-time.\n\"Vive, for example, has addressed the issue with special controllers. It's not something that people have been crying out for.\"\nThe unveiling of Project Alloy comes seven months after Intel disclosed some of its other VR and AR efforts.\nAt the  Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it showed off an augmented reality helmet for construction workers, made by the start-up Daqri, and a smartphone virtual reality accessory made by IonVR.\nBoth incorporated its RealSense sensors.",

Their views, however noisily they are broadcast, do not represent the bulk of the population.\nEgypt has also survived worse crises within living memory: the assassination of its president by a jihadist cell in 1981 and an Islamist insurgency that killed more than 700 people in the late 1990s, culminating in the massacre of 58 foreign tourists at Luxor in 1997.\nBut given the unhappy confluence of events and trends surfacing in Egypt this week, it would be unwise to ignore the seeds of a potential holy war now being sown.\nLet's look at the ingredients:\n\"We will carry out explosions, we will shoulder arms, and nothing other than death will dissuade us from restoring President Morsi to the palace,\" the newspaper, al-Hayat, quoted a bearded man proclaiming at one of the sit-ins by Muslim Brotherhood supporters.\nSmall numbers of young men are starting to be seen in the crowd wearing the white shrouds of \"martyrdom\", a theatrical show of how far some say they are prepared to go to return an elected Islamist president to power.\nSince Mr Morsi's removal, some internet forums have erupted with angry calls for vengeance against Egypt's military, calling it \"the enemy of Islam\" and declaring police and soldiers to be targets for attack, as they were in southern Egypt during the insurgency of the 1990s.\nFor now, these statements are mostly rhetorical and aspirational - although security forces have often been attacked in the Sinai.\nThe threat to mainland Egypt only becomes real when such rhetoric inspires people to translate it into violent action.\nSecurity in Egypt has deteriorated dramatically since the overthrow of the dictatorial President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, but compared with Syria, Libya, Iraq and Yemen there are still relatively few firearms in private hands.\nYet mainland Egypt is sandwiched between two land masses awash with illegal weapons: Libya and the Sinai peninsula.\nThe overthrow of Col Muammar Gaddafi's regime next-door in Libya threw open the doors to his armouries, releasing a flood of firearms, many of which have ended up with jihadist groups operating across the Sahara and in eastern Libya.\nA UN report published in April concluded that \"weapons used during the Libyan civil war against Muammar Gaddafi are being funnelled at an alarming rate to other countries in the region\".\nIt said the weapons ranged from small arms to high-powered explosives, mines and portable air-defence systems.\nThe report said this flow of weapons into Egypt was a threat to its internal security because many were reaching anti-government insurgents in Sinai.\nNearly 10% of Egypt's population are Coptic Christians.\nMostly, they live harmoniously in this Muslim-majority country but some Islamist extremists want to see them driven out, as much of Iraq's Christian population has been.\nThere have been isolated but deadly attacks on Egypt's churches and Christians, and for the past year during Mr Morsi's presidency, many Egyptian Copts doubted his government's commitment to protect their community properly.\nNow that he has been ousted, there is a counter-suspicion by some Muslim Brotherhood supporters that Christians somehow had a hand in his removal.\nIf Egypt were to fall prey to jihadist violence, then its Coptic Christians would find themselves easy targets.\nThere is an almost unanimous view amongst analysts of the Middle East that, however incompetent the rule of President Morsi was, his forced removal after just one year in office sends a very dangerous message to Islamists.\nIt risks leaving them with the conclusion that the democratic process the West has touted for so long is an avenue closed to them, prompting some to turn to the bullet instead of the ballot.\nWriting in al-Quds al-Arabi, the editor Abdel Bari Atwan said: \"The military coup will certainly lead to serving extremist groups within the Islamic current, specifically within the Muslim Brotherhood, and will confirm the argument of al-Qaeda and other groups, which reject democracy and consider it a Western invention.\"\nLastly, but no less importantly, Egypt is facing a slow-motion economic crisis.\nSince the 2011 uprising against Mr Mubarak, the country's latent economic and fiscal problems have gone into free fall.\nTourism has slumped, unemployment and crime has soared, confidence has evaporated and the government is running out of money.\nMr Morsi's inability to fix these problems was a major contributor to his unpopularity but those problems will still be there for whoever becomes his elected successor.\nA combination of a failing economy, zero job prospects and profound political frustration can lead to a dangerous sense of despair. Fertile ground, then, for those looking to recruit for nefarious purposes.\nYou can follow Frank on Twitter @FrankRGardner\nMardell: When is a coup not a coup?\nBowen: Egypt's failed democratic experiment\nQ&A: Egypt in turmoil\nKey players in the Egyptian crisis",

The Doyles were among a number of families on board its inaugural cruise from Rome.\n\"There was a lovely mix of ages on the Majestic and in the kids' club Chris was talking to a boy from Beijing. He'd been learning about China at school so it was great for him,\" Mr Doyle said.\n\"There's a perception the people on board are 10 years older than us but I saw several big groups of people in their late 20s,\" he added.\n\"The world's getting smaller - who'd have thought 20 years ago, a normal, working-class man like me could afford to do this?\"\nAdam Coulter - editor of www.cruisecritic.co.uk\nThere are several reasons that have come together and caused this changing market.\nYou have a vast choice of ships which appeal to family groups, as well as millennials. I've just been on a two-day cruise to France and I've never seen such a young demographic. There were hen parties, 40th birthday groups, multi-generational and small family groups.\nThere's also a growth in theme cruising. Anchored, a ship-based dance festival, took place in June and was headlined by Tinie Tempah. These are common currency in the US - from Star Trek to music themes - but are just starting to really take off here.\nCruises are good value. If you're a family, the kids' clubs are included, as is all your food and entertainment. The childcare really is of a high standard and ships are so safe.\nAnd cruise lines have made massive strides in technology and internet connectivity, which appeal to a younger demographic. Ships have made their wi-fi cheaper and quicker as they've realised people want to post on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. It's all about the experience.\nTwo 20-somethings on board the Majestic were Sophie Ortyl, 28 and her boyfriend, 25-year-old Joe Campey, both from Crawley in Sussex.\n\"This was my 11th cruise,\" Ms Ortyl said proudly.\n\"My nan paid for the whole family to go on a cruise when I was 16, for her wedding anniversary, and I thought it would be all old people. But there was so much going on, the people were fun and the food and drinks were amazing.\"\nNow hooked on cruising, Ms Ortyl has done four maiden voyages and has booked to go on Royal Caribbean's new ship, Symphony of the Seas, next year with her boyfriend.\n\"The food on the ships is amazing, the best food I've had. If I hadn't have met Sophie, I'd never have done a cruise,\" said Mr Campey.\nCertainly it's a type of break that some holidaymakers would never consider; suspicious about the company they'd be forced to keep and unwilling to sacrifice the freedom to make their own itinerary.\nSome might also cite the risk of mass outbreaks of sickness and diarrhoea as a major concern. In the past, cruise companies have paid out thousands in compensation to passengers whose holidays were ruined.\nOthers have ethical concerns about the poor pay and conditions some crew members face, most working long hours, with their take-home pay dependent on commission or tips.\nKeeping it all shipshape - Francesca Maglione, on board events manager for MSC Meraviglia\n\"Every day is a great surprise for me. I start early and the day can take many unexpected turns. I organise all of the events that take place on board... parties, meetings, conferences, weddings, proposals, anniversaries and much more.\n\"I'm an organisational madwoman, as you'd expect, and without a doubt my highlighters, coloured pens and markers are among my prized possessions!\n\"The best part of this job on board is that you are working as part of a team, which often feels more like family, with a mix of colleagues of many nationalities.\n\"My most memorable couple so far was from Portugal. The ceremony was a surprise for the bride and was very romantic. I felt proud we had a chance to share this together so by the end of the ceremony all of us were crying, officers included.\n\"[It can be hard] when I reach the end of my emotional reserves after a long day but thanks to my experience, I know how to manage this.\"\nOf course would be misleading to say cruise ships are packed full of under 25s and family groups - the average age of a cruise passenger is 55 - but companies are working hard to expand into these markets.\nWith many UK schools breaking up for the holidays, cruise operators are looking at record numbers of families on board.\nPrincess Cruises, part of the US-owned Carnival group, is open about its plans to attract more families with a complete overhaul of its kids' clubs and a partnership with the Discovery Channel.\nOn and off its ships there are further options for families including tailored shore excursions for parents and children, onboard sports and activities such as kids' dance classes, and family movie nights via its top-deck cinema screen.\nAs a result, Princess has reported a drop in the age of its guests. Next summer there will be almost twice as many UK under 18s on its main Southampton-based ship than there were two years ago. And the number of 35-44 year olds - many of them parents - has doubled.\nTony Roberts, Princess Cruises' vice president UK and Europe, said: \"Our core guest is still over 50 and we would never shy away from ensuring we cater for that audience.\n\"But families and younger guests are unquestionably an ever-growing market for us.\"\nKids-eye view\nEdie and Eloise, eight-year-old twins from landlocked Nottinghamshire, were on the Majestic Princess' inaugural cruise - also their first - from Rome.\n\"We loved the ice cream and the swimming pools. And the shows were really, really good, especially the Unexpected Boys and the Beatlemaniacs.\n\"We dressed up for dinner every night and had our own kids' menu - we could have a special pudding and if you didn't like it, you could have a different one.\n\"Kids' club was brilliant.

Harmony of the Seas in numbers\n\"The biggest challenge we have is dispelling what many people think cruising is about. There are about 1.7 million people in the UK who cruise, yet there are 40 million holidaymakers a year.\n\"We're really competing against land-based holidays to get more customers.\n\"Due to macro-political and economic issues in certain areas of Europe, some places aren't as accessible as they were, prices are being driven up and cruising is much better value.\"\nJohn and Trish Smith, both 50 and from Horwich in Lancashire, have been on dozens of cruises.\nThe couple - John a custody sergeant and Trish who works as a local council safeguarding administrator - used to go a static caravan park in France for all their holidays. But when they took their first cruise with P&O in 2001, with a group of 38 friends and family, they were hooked.\n\"We've got four kids and didn't think we could afford a cruise,\" said Trish. \"But we found a good deal, with a four-berth cabin, and never looked back. It was cheaper than going on an all-inclusive package holiday.\"\nThe pair have travelled all over the world on cruise ships, their latest a trip around the Med - this time without the children.\nMr Smith said: \"We've just sold our touring caravan but we love both types of holiday. What's so good about this is you don't have to pack and unpack and get to see lots of different places.\n\"On the first cruise we were on, there were some lads fighting in the nightclub and they got turfed off at the next stop. There was also a couple in their 80s who got sent off because they'd been stealing cutlery and stashing it in their cabin.\"\nMrs Smith added: \"We've been on cruises with a man overboard, been through a really bad storm and experienced a medical emergency where a woman needed a blood transfusion and loads of people came forward to help.\n\"There's a preconception that cruising is stiff and starchy but it's not like that any more. You've just got to do your research and find the cruise that's right for you - there really is one for everybody.\"",

It is an engineering marvel and helped the economic and social well-being of south Wales overnight.\"\nThe \u00a33m tunnels project - led by engineer Sir Owen Williams, chief engineer on the old Wembley Stadium, the Spaghetti Junction, and the Newport bypass - relieved the \"crippling congestion\" in a stroke when it opened on 5 May 1967.\n\"Its success has ultimately led to its biggest criticism,\" said Mr Hawker.\n\"Built to accommodate 30,000 vehicles a day, it is nearing breaking point and traffic data says its the UK's most-congested stretch of motorway away from the M25.\n\"The opening of the Brynglas tunnels bypass around Newport and the Severn Bridge opened up the area, as getting around Newport and going to England was previously like going on safari,\" added Mr Hawker, the Welsh Office's former head of roads and major projects.\nHe added: \"Now it took 30 minutes and gave relief to Newport and gave quick access to schools, work and hospitals.\n\"The tunnels and the ease of movement around south Wales raised people's expectations, but the tunnels have outgrown their capacity as demand for road travel rose beyond all recognition.\"\nThe Welsh Government have acknowledged the current M4 at Newport is \"not fit for purpose\" and said it wants to build a \u00a31bn M4 relief road to ease congestion.\nA six-lane motorway to the south of Newport was first proposed as far back as 1991 and only now is a public inquiry being held into building a 15-mile (24km) relief road.\nThe benefit of hindsight shows today's problems could have been averted way back in the early 1960s.\nOne plan was to make a cut in the hill, but the Monmouthshire railway company line - between Newport and Pontypool on the east side of Crindau Ridge - meant the tunnel was the only option at the time.\nMr Hawker said: \"The shame is Dr Beeching's cuts closed that line in 1963, half way through construction.\n\"With a little planning, some of the subsequent traffic problems could have been averted as we would have built the road through the hill.\"\nThe initial M4 route - from the Severn Bridge to Tredegar Park in Newport, now junction 28 - was strategically located through the middle of Newport to generate traffic numbers to justify its existence to government.\nThen, Newport was unique as, despite being a relatively small town, it had five motorway junctions to attract local traffic to use the M4 as a bypass and not a long-haul route, the intention of a motorway.\nThe line of the Newport bypass was dictated by the need to open the south Wales valleys, towns like Pontypool, Newbridge, Risca and the new town of Cwmbran, according to Mr Hawker.\n\"These were important strategic areas of economic resurgence following the demise of heavy industry. The development of a new, vibrant valleys economy was absolutely dependant on good road access,\" he said.\nBut the UK-first was not without its challenges and it cost one local his prized vegetables.\n\"I remember a representation to our site office from a house owner on the hill, who said he was concerned because he had just lost his prized leeks,\" said Mr Hawker.\n\"They were due to be shown at a horticultural show the following week,\" he said.\n\"It turned out that there was diagonal movement in the rock and that couldn't be controlled. Engineers found his house was cracked from top to bottom and had to be demolished.\n\"As a result of that movement, a dozen families had to be moved from their homes, put into a hotel while the necessary engineering work was carried out.\"",

And it has emerged this figure has become 23bn.\n\"Who is responsible for this? How did we get here? It was the fear of responsibility and indecision of the previous government,\" he added.\nAnalysts are now questioning if Cyprus can raise such a sum.\nBy Mark LowenBBC News\nEurozone officials patted themselves on the back last month as it seemed that Cyprus had been rescued. The bailout was approved: Cyprus would raise around 7bn euros itself, and its creditors would cough up about 10bn.\nThen reality set in as a botched deal began to unravel. The recession will be far deeper, requiring greater government spending on benefits. And troubled banks might need further recapitalisation.\nSo Cyprus must dig deeper. That will crush large savers at the Bank of Cyprus, who face a potential loss of up to 60% to cover the shortfall.\nBut one government MP told me that a worse recession might require more austerity, which could then deepen the recession still, locking Cyprus into a vicious circle. And that may prompt a second bailout. Serious questions remain over this island's survival in the single currency.\nThe winding up of one Cypriot bank, Popular, and the writing-off of a large portion of secured debt and uninsured deposits in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus, should raise a total of 10.6bn euros.\nThere have also been reports that Cyprus may sell a large portion of its gold reserves in order to raise another 400m euros.\n\"The sheer size of the increase has underlined the extent of the enormous challenges facing Cyprus itself,'' said Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics in an analyst note.\nThe Cypriot economy is only worth about 18bn euros and accounts for less than 0.2% of the eurozone total. Several analysts now think the Cypriot economy may shrink by more than 10% this year alone.\n\"If everything goes according to plan, the growth figures might at least be in a realistic range, if too optimistic,'' said Christoph Weil of Germany's Commerzbank.\n\"If there are any problems, and there are significant downside risks, then it could be much worse, and a combined contraction of 20% is within the range of the possible.\"\nEurozone and EU finance ministers will meet in Dublin on Friday in a bid to finalise the Cyprus bailout.

But believe me, on long days in Westminster, this is the kind of hypothesising that concerns politicians and their teams.\nReady?\nConspiracy One - Michael Gove's decision to go with the Vote Leave campaign was taken to make sure that Chancellor George Osborne will be challenged in the eventual Tory leadership by someone who is a chum, who looks on him favourably, but who would get onto the final ballot (which crucially only has two contenders) as someone who can claim to the party membership which is broadly Eurosceptic, that they fought to leave the EU, even though they were then sadly defeated.\nThis, so Conspiracy One goes, is why Mr Gove's decision to join Vote Leave has not impressed some true believers in the cause and, in any case, his public image may well not be a benefit to them.\nConspiracy Two - Doing the rounds inside Number 10 and Number 11 (the chancellor's abode) so the theory goes, is that Boris is intent on becoming 'The Man Who Tried'. What? Well, Downing Street has concluded that Mr Johnson is going for Leave precisely because he is confident that they will lose.\nThis allows him to create the perfect platform for his leadership ambition - campaign for Leave, Remain wins, but Boris manages to then glide onto the leadership ballot as the man who gave it his damnedest, didn't quite pull it off, but can scoop up oodles of votes from the broken-hearted Tory membership, despairing in defeat, but ready to go over the top for their hero.\nThis kills Mr Gove, or anyone else's chances of opposing Mr Osborne in the final round of the leadership contest.\nIf you got this far, and feel enlightened by it all, then marvellous. If it seems fanciful, then don't say I didn't warn you!\nBut with the prime minister having already announced that he's leaving his job before the next election, there is no escaping the fact that the future of the Tory leadership is a factor in both sides' campaigns.",

Just 1% of respondents mentioned the predator in the latest survey.\nHowever, people did rate it ahead of creatures that do inhabit Scotland and have conservation issues, such as puffins, voles, red kites and ptarmigan.\nWolves were driven to extinction by persecution and hunting. Chieftains and royalty led some of the hunting parties.\nOne attended by Queen Mary in 1563 employed 2,000 Highlanders and ended in the deaths of five wolves and 360 deer.\nHuge swathes of forest in Perthshire, Lochaber and Argyll were systematically destroyed to deprive wolves of their habitat.\nThe remains of a wolf trap have also been found at Moy, near Inverness, dating from between the 16th and 18th centuries.\nWolves were lured by bait onto a carefully weighted plank above a deep pit covered with brush wood.\nAnimals killed near Brora, in Sutherland, in 1700 and another at Findhorn, in Moray, in 1743 were among Scotland's last.\nMore recently there has been debate on the release wolves in Scotland, including into a large enclosed area at the Alladale Estate in Sutherland.",

If they do penetrate the wall, they are \"vacuumed out\" by the cell.\nShe said: \"My team is looking at what are the switches in those bacteria which turn that vacuum cleaner off, and at molecules which would have the same effect.  If we can do that, we can make the bacteria sensitive to antibiotics.\"\nProf Piddock said there had not been enough global investment in finding new drugs.\nShe said: \"It is very difficult to find drugs against bacteria like E.coli because they are so naturally resistant.\n\"We need more investment and new business models to ensure the pipeline is filled with promising molecules, to ensure that we can solve this problem, and make sure the drugs are there when patients need them.\"",

It looks like it might be connected to early Homo erectus, or Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis,\" said Prof Berger's colleague, John Hawks, from the University of Wisconsin.\nAlthough some experts guessed that naledi could had lived relatively recently, in 2015, Prof Berger told BBC News that the remains could be up to three million years old.\nNew dating evidence places the species in a time period where Homo naledi could have overlapped with early examples of our own kind, Homo sapiens.\nProf Hawks told the BBC's Inside Science radio programme: \"They're the age of Neanderthals in Europe, they're the age of Denisovans in Asia, they're the age of early modern humans in Africa. They're part of this diversity in the world that's there as our species was originating.\"\n\"We have no idea what else is out there in Africa for us to find - for me that's the big message. If this lineage, which looks like it originated two million years ago was still hanging around 200,000 years ago, then maybe that's not the end of it. We haven't found the last [Homo naledi], we've found one.\"\nThe naledi remains were uncovered in 2013 inside a difficult-to-access chamber within the Rising Star cave system. At the time, Prof Berger said he believed the remains had been deposited in the chamber deliberately, perhaps over generations.\nThis idea, which would suggest that Homo naledi was capable of ritual behaviour, met with controversy because such practices are thought by some to be characteristic of human modernity.\nProf Hawks says that the team has since started exploring a second chamber.\n\"[The second] chamber has the remains of an additional three individuals, at least, including a really, really cool partial skeleton with a skull,\" said Prof Hawks.\nResearchers have already attempted to extract DNA from the remains to gain more information about naledi's place in the human evolutionary tree. However, they have not yet been successful.\n\"[The remains] are obviously at an age where we have every reason to think there might be some chance.

With his pace and trickery, I think he could have a big impact from the bench in France this summer.\nIt's a similar case for Jonny Williams. We all know how talented the Crystal Palace midfielder is, and it's good to see him playing regularly on loan at MK Dons. He would bring creativity to the squad, which could be crucial if someone like Ramsey picks up an injury.\nBoth George and Jonny Williams have been unlucky with injury, as has Emyr Huws, who I would also take to France. The Wigan midfielder has impressed on loan at Huddersfield this season and I thought he was excellent alongside Joe Allen against Ukraine.\nI would also pick young Walsall striker Tom Bradshaw. He may be playing in League One but he's a prolific goalscorer and, as he showed with his substitute appearance against Ukraine, his movement in the box could make him a surprise package for Wales.\nColeman will have to make some tough decisions as he chooses his squad of 23, and the hardest bit of all will be telling some players that they have missed out.\nI think Nottingham Forest midfielder David Vaughan will be one of those unlucky players. He is neat and busy but central midfield is one of the most competitive areas in this squad and I think he's a bit too similar to midfielders such as Allen.\nTom Lawrence, currently on loan at Cardiff from Leicester, is another who may just miss out.

He was in and out of hospital for three months. But Ms Coombes, 33, from Plymouth, says her father didn't feel he had good care there. She says his symptoms and sickness couldn't be controlled, so the family decided to take him out of hospital to die at home.\nShe said: \"While he was in hospital the palliative care team came for about five minutes, while he was in his bed with everyone around and just said you are going to die.\n\"Apart from that we did not get any leaflets or any help... It is not something I would want anyone else to experience.\"\nDr Kevin Stewart, of the Royal College of Physicians, said in general he was encouraged by the improvements.\nBut he added: \"We are disappointed that there are still major deficiencies in the provision of specialist palliative care at nights and weekends by many trusts; patients and their families deserve the same level of service whatever the day of the week.\"\nDr Adrian Tookman, at the charity Marie Curie, which part-funded the review, said  \"We can't ignore the fact that the vast majority of dying people and those close to them still have limited or no access to specialist palliative care support when they need it in hospital. This is not right, nor good enough.\n\"Care of the dying has no respect for time, so if we are to deliver a consistent 7-day service by 2020, it is critical that funding is directed towards recruiting and training doctors and nurses to provide specialist care now.\"\nNHS England, which commissioned the review, welcomed the improvements, but said it was clear that more could be done.\nA spokesperson added: \"Although this audit presents a snapshot of end-of-life care within NHS hospitals, there are clear variations in the support and services received  - and there are areas where improvements must continue to be made.\"",

Growing up in Canada to Punjabi Sikh parents, she recalls being into sports and photography.\nThe first erotic fiction she ever read was EL James's Fifty Shades of Grey on Kindle. \"I remember reading and thinking, 'this is intense', and giggling.\"\nIndian authors and experts in the publishing business say Leone's erotic fiction has come at the right time in the market.\nAnanth Padmanabhan, an erotic fiction author, says that India has also succumbed to the \"bold erotic effect of 50 Shades of Grey\" in the same way Harry Potter influenced fantasy across books and films.\n\"India has an appetite for erotic fiction despite moral policing and Leone's stories are part of that wave to titillate the market that wants more.\"\nChiki Sarkar, Juggernaut's publisher, says: \"Erotica is one of the high-selling genres for e-books globally and we felt it would work for the smartphone as well.\"\nMoreover, Leone has a massive fan following across India and on social media platforms.\n\"Leone has about 22 million followers across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, including many women who have all been enthusiastic about her foray into writing,\" says Ms Sarkar.\nLeone's own story is of an adult entertainment star who has become the most-searched person on Google by Indians.\nIn 2011, Indian television viewers were first introduced to Leone in the fifth season of the reality TV show, Bigg Boss.\nThe show, an Indian version of Celebrity Big Brother, had Leone, as a wild card entrant, bringing her closer to Indian television audiences who had until then known her as an American porn star of Indian origin.\nLeone dropped out from her studies in Canada when she was 18 to enter the adult entertainment business in the US.\nShe initially worked as an erotic model and later moved to the adult film business.\nLeone recalls she was criticised by many Indians who condemned her job as an adult film star in the US.\n\"I  was called every name in the book,\" she recalls, adding that she took her time to research about the popularity of Bigg Boss in India before deciding to participate in the show.\nSince her Bigg Boss stint, her popularity has been soaring in India.\nShe has acted in 15 Hindi films, including erotic thrillers, adult comedies, racy entertainers, and a couple of glamorous cameos in south Indian films.\n\"I am a risk taker and since I was young I always would try as many things as possible to see what was comfortable to me.\"\nShe says entering the porn industry, or her acting career in Bollywood and her newly minted author role are all offers that she took on as challenges.\nBut her rising popularity has also brought criticism from India's moral police.\n\"I would say there are more important things than me or my job to fight over. Fight to better the plight of poor, naked children on our streets, make your cities cleaner else, plant trees,\" she says.\nWhen a male TV anchor asked her some uncomfortable questions about her past in an interview in January, she remained calm and dignified.\nHer responses won praise from social media users, while the anchor received criticism.\n\"It (her job as a porn star) just happened; I have no horror story to narrate and I am not ashamed of it. Everything that's happened since then has been only good,\" she tells the BBC.\nAs for the future, she has made a song with Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan for his upcoming film Raees.

It added that it was teaming up with Volvo.\nAt first, the vehicles will be supervised by a driver, who can take control if necessary, and an observer, Bloomberg reported.\nThe firm first revealed plans to replace human drivers two years ago.\nMore than one million people drive vehicles linked to its app, but are not directly employed by the company.\nA spokeswoman for the firm told the BBC: \"Starting later this month, Uber will allow customers in downtown Pittsburgh to summon self-driving cars from their phones, crossing an important milestone that no automotive or technology company has yet achieved.\n\"In Pittsburgh, customers will request cars the normal way, via Uber's app, and will be paired with a driverless car at random. Trips will be free for the time being, rather than the standard local rate of $1.30 [\u00c2\u00a30.98] per mile.\"\nShe added that Volvo had already sent a small number of sensor-equipped XC90 sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to Uber, which would be used in the initial trials. The carmaker intends to have delivered 100 such cars to its partner by the end of the year.\nUber had previously used modified Ford Fusions to test its self-driving tech.\nVolvo has confirmed it is taking part in a \"joint project\" between Uber and the carmaker.\n\"Both Uber and Volvo will use the same base vehicle for the next stage of their own autonomous car strategies,\" the firm said.\n\"This will involve Uber adding its own self-developed autonomous driving systems to the Volvo base vehicle.\"\nEngineers from both companies would collaborate on the project, the firm added.\n\"This alliance places Volvo at the heart of the current technological revolution in the automotive industry,\" said Hakan Samuelsson, president and chief executive of Volvo.\nThe Bloomberg story notes that the Volvo deal will not be an exclusive one and that Uber plans to work with other carmakers.\nUber's hard-charging founder Travis Kalanick has been outlining a vision of a self-driving fleet for some years - but it always sounded like a long-term vision akin to Elon Musk's plan for a settlement on Mars.\nIndeed, two years ago the company's operations director Ryan Graves told me that focussing on self-driving cars was a \"fool's errand\" in the short term and that nobody would be getting in one in the next few years.\nSo, the news that self-driving Ubers will be available to customers in Pittsburgh later this month comes as a huge surprise.\nIt will be a wake-up call to Google - which has done so much work in this field but has yet to launch any kind of commercial service - and to Mr Musk's Tesla, currently battling adverse publicity over the reliability of its Autopilot function.\nIt is also a measure of just how much money Uber has invested in its automated driving research programme - but having raised over $10 billion (\u00c2\u00a37.6bn) from backers, the company has plenty of financial firepower at its disposal.\nOne caveat however - the \"self-driving\" Volvos picking up Uber users will still have a human in the driving seat as a supervisor. Even if Uber was confident enough in the technology to dispense with a human, neither Pittsburgh nor any other city is ready to adapt its regulations to allow completely autonomous driving.\nAnd that means that Uber's latest coup is an impressive piece of marketing for its vision of the future of transport, but will prove a very expensive way of ferrying people around for some years to come.\nSome of Uber's know-how in the field of self-driving vehicles has come via its agreement to purchase Otto, a start-up founded by former Google employees to develop driverless trucks.\nOtto was co-founded by Anthony Levandowski, whose previous start-up, 510 Systems, was bought by Google when it began its own self-driving vehicles project.\nVolvo has already been testing self-driving versions of the same vehicle in Sweden as part of its \"Drive Me\" project, said Alan Stevens at the UK's Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) and the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).\nThe firm has also trialled the vehicle in Australia and plans to do so in London next year.\n\"I think it works well and I think it's a good small step to be taking,\" Mr Stevens told the BBC.",

        "source_text": "The author discovered he had cancer last year, and wrote about the experience in his last book, Quicksand: What It Means To Be A Human Being.\nHis best-selling novels, which follow policeman Kurt Wallander through Sweden and Mozambique, were turned into a TV drama starring Sir Kenneth Branagh.\nSir Kenneth paid tribute, calling the author \"a fine writer and a fine man\".\nHe was the third actor to play the irascible detective. In Mankell's home country, both Rolf Lassgard and Krister Henriksson played the role. BBC Four screened the latter version in the UK.\nIn a statement, Sir Kenneth said: \"In life and in art Henning Mankell was a man of passionate commitment. I will miss his provocative intelligence and his great personal generosity. Aside from his stringent political activism, and his decades of work in Africa, he also leaves an immense contribution to Scandinavian literature.\n\"His loving family, and those privileged to know him, together with readers from all over the world, will mourn a fine writer and a fine man.\"\nBorn in February 1948, Mankell wrote dozens of plays, novels, children's books and screenplays. But it was for his Wallander series that he was most renowned.\nThe rumpled and gloomy detective got his name when Mankell ran his finger through a telephone directory, but went on to sell more than 40 million books.\nMankell's life and career were shaped by the divorce of his parents when he was just two years old. He lived with his father, a judge, and barely saw his mother until he was 15.\nWhen the family moved to a remote town in the north of Sweden, the young Mankell immersed himself in books, reading extensively about Africa, and learned that imagination could be an instrument of survival, not just of creativity.\n\"In my mind I created another mother for myself to replace the one who had left,\" he once said. \"And I think this was me at my best, when the forces of imagination had the same value as the real world.\"\nUnimpressed by school, he left at the age of 16 to join the merchant navy, becoming a stevedore labourer on a Swedish ship carrying coal and iron ore. Two years later, he set up home in Paris, barely scraping a living (\"I don't know how I survived,\" he said) but thriving on the student activism and political debate\nAfter a year and a half, he returned to Stockholm to work as a stagehand. There, aged 20, he wrote his first play, The Amusement Park, about Swedish colonial interests in 19th Century South America. His debut novel, The Stone-Blaster, soon followed.\nKurt Wallander first appeared in 1989's Faceless Killers, investigating a murder in which the only clue is that the perpetrators appear to have been foreigners. When that information was leaked to the public, it triggered a series of racially-motivated attacks, explored in the book through the themes of racism and national identity in Sweden.\nAt first, the author was unaware he had created a recurring character, \"but then I realised after two or three novels that I had this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 instrument who could be useful\".\nSpeaking to the Telegraph in 2011, he said: \"I wanted to show how difficult it is to be a good police officer. But after, I think, the third novel, I spoke to this friend of mine and asked what sort of disease I could give him. Without hesitating, she said: 'Diabetes!' So I gave him diabetes and that made him more popular.\n\"I mean, you could never imagine James Bond giving himself a shot of insulin, but with Wallander it seemed perfectly natural.\"\nAlthough he became known as a leading proponent of \"Scandi Crime\", Mankell was not a fan of genre fiction.\n\"I could never write a crime story just for the sake of it, because I always want to talk about certain things,\" he said, citing Macbeth as the best crime story he had ever read, and John Le Carre as a key influence.\n\"He investigates the contradictions inside man, between men, and between man and society; and I hope to do the same,\" he told The Guardian.\nSir Kenneth tried to bring the same gravitas to his TV portrayal of the detective.\n\"We're not taking lightly the idea of people being murdered,\" he told the BBC in 2010. \"Wallander demands that he and his colleagues care and the drama invites the audience to do the same.\"\nThroughout his adult life, Mankell divided his time between Sweden and Mozambique, where he ran a theatre company and devoted time to the fight against Aids.\nHe was active in the \"memory books\" project, which encourages parents with HIV to record their stories, not just for their children but for future generations.\nShortly after New Year 2014, the author went to see an orthopaedic surgeon in Stockholm with what he assumed was a slipped disc. But tests revealed a tumour in his lung, another in his neck, and evidence the cancer had spread throughout his body.\n\"It was a catastrophe for me,\" he told US radio station NPR last year. \"Everything that was normal to me up to that point was gone all of a sudden. No one had died of cancer in my family. I had always assumed I'd die of something else.\"\nHis survivors include his wife of 17 years, Eva Bergman -  the daughter of Ingmar Bergman's second wife, the dancer Ellen Lundstrom - and his son, Jon Mankell, a film producer who helped bring Stieg Larsson's Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series to the big screen.",

International pricing and launches will be announced soon.\n\"For years, YouTube's fans have been telling us they want more,\" the company wrote in a blog post.\n\"More choice when watching their favourite content, more ways to support their favourite creators and, above all, the option to watch their favourite videos uninterrupted.\"\nYouTube Red original shows will include:\nScare PewDiePie - a reality adventure series as Felix reacts to situations inspired by his favourite games.\nSing it! - A comedy that satirises talent competitions\nLazer Team - A movie featuring four losers who find an alien ship carrying an strange cargo\nA Trip to Unicorn Island - An in-depth look at the life of Lilly Singh as she embarks on a 26 city tour.\nSingle by 30 - a romantic drama about two high school friends who pledge to marry each other if they are still unwed at 30\nFight of the Living Dead - a reality show that puts popular YouTubers in a frightening zombie apocalypse to see how they cope\nI Am Tobuscus - a comedy about a self-involved YouTube creator trying to be a big star\nThe roster also includes some as yet untitled items such as a show based around the science of video games that will be filmed for VR headsets, a reality series that puts YouTube stars into a murder mystery setting and an anthology looking at the absurdity of internet culture.\nYouTube content will be able to be downloaded and watched offline, a contrasting approach to Netflix - its chief product officer last month said offline viewing wasn't something users wanted.\nThe subscription will include access to YouTube Gaming and a new YouTube Music app, also announced on Wednesday. Google's streaming music service, Google Play Music, will also be included.\nThis package deal of sorts could present a threat to Apple Music and Spotify whose services, which are solely audio, are roughly the same price.\nWhile the free, ad-supported version of YouTube will remain as-is, the move represents the first time that YouTube will limit some material to paying customers only.\nThose members will get productions featuring YouTube stars who regularly command audiences bigger than global broadcast giants, working with high-end production houses on the original content.\nThe first of these shows will be rolled out early next year.\nArguably the most well-known, PewDiePie - real name Felix Kjellberg - will be working with the executive producers behind blockbuster zombie series The Walking Dead on a \"reality adventure series\".\nThe show will include \"thrills, chills and laughter as PewDiePie encounters terrifying situations inspired by his favourite video games\".\nAnother show \"takes popular YouTube talent and traps them in a frighteningly realistic zombie apocalypse. They must use their instincts and gaming skills to survive as they battle the elements for the ultimate prize of survival\".\nIn all, the company announced 10 original projects, including one project that will be shot in 360 degrees and designed to be enjoyed using a virtual reality headset.\nThe move represents YouTube's gradual shift from being the first giant of the new media age to something resembling a more traditional media company, with executives deciding what content is made and promoted - albeit heavily influenced by online trends and viewing data.\nMoving to a paywall model could be appealing to creators who could receive higher revenues from paying YouTube customers than they currently do from advertising revenue shared with YouTube.\nHowever, that relies on YouTube's ability to get an audience not used to paying for content to commit to a monthly subscription. Or, tougher still, YouTube has to convince the parents of those fans to start paying instead.\nAnd breathing down YouTube's neck is Facebook. After rolling out auto-playing videos to its news feed, the site recently started creating dedicated video areas, much like YouTube Channels.\nBehind the scenes YouTube has been busy trying to convince advertisers that its viewers are comparatively more engaged than Facebook users in what they are watching - and that YouTube has stricter criteria over what exactly constitutes a \"view\".\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter: @DaveLeeBBC",

These all incorporate Landsat pictures.\nSentinel's data has been designed to be complementary, but the platform also represents a big jump in capability.\nIts imaging instrument will be sensitive across more bands of light (13 versus Landsat's eight), allowing it to discern more information about the land beneath it; and Sentinel-2a will \"carpet map\" a much wider strip of ground (290km versus 185km).\nIn addition, its colour images have a best resolution of 10m, versus Landsat's 30m.\nGiven that today, non-specialist use of Earth imagery overwhelmingly relies on Landsat data, it is more than probable that Sentinel products will be in big demand.\nThe European Commission will be using Sentinel pictures in its Copernicus programme to run variety of services, reaching across agriculture and forestry, urban planning and disaster mitigation.\nAgriculture, though, is certain to be a big user. The satellite's camera sensor has been designed to detect very specific wavelengths of light that detail the health of plants.\nIn normal operation, Sentinel-2a will be producing 1.7 terabytes of processed data per day. And this will double when the sister satellite, Sentinel-2b, is launched next year.\n\"The data volume is incredible,\" Dr Hoersch told BBC News.\n\"Of course, we all knew it would be like this, but when you sit there with your computer and try to download it, it's massive - gigabytes of data.

Two Chinese researchers demonstrated a photo-realistic talking head - type in some text and he'll say anything you want, blinking and moving almost like a real person.\nCraig Mundie says the success of Kinect, which racked up 8m sales in its first 60 days, is proof that the sheer scale of Microsoft's R&D strategy is paying off.\n\"Microsoft is at a point where many of the things that we've been researching for twenty years are starting to add up and produce solutions,\" he says. \"You can't rely on two guys in a garage to make all the changes, some of these things require a huge amount of technology and a lot of scale.\"\nBut Microsoft desperately needed a hit from its research labs.\nEver since Bill Gates decided 20 years ago that the company would spend big bucks on trying to see into the future, there have been ideas aplenty but few stand out products. A decade ago, for instance, Gates was showing off tablet computers - but it took Apple and its iPad to make them mainstream.\nPeter Lee, who runs the Redmond lab, says the research operation has a wide remit, from dealing with instant fixes to current products to blue-sky thinking.\nProfessor Lee, who joined Microsoft last year after a distinguished academic career and a spell at the US defence agency DARPA, insists the labs are having an impact  on a daily basis.\nHe cites the contribution to what he describes as the \"holy war in search\", the battle between Google and Microsoft's Bing.\n\"Hour by hour we have a large group of researchers actively involved in Bing, constantly adding new research advances into the product.\"\nBut he thinks the long-term research is equally important.\n\"Some call it navel-gazing, we call it pushing back the frontiers of human knowledge,\" he says with a smile, predicting that his lab will one day win a Nobel prize.\nHis boss Craig Mundie is Microsoft's big thinker, charting the path of its future research. His current obsession is what he calls natural user interfaces, new ways of interacting with computers, of which Kinect is one example.\nThere is, he says, a shift about to happen from the old graphical user interface to a trend where \"the computer is more like us - it sees, it listens, it speaks, it understands, it even seeks to do things on our behalf.\"\nIt is an intriguing vision, but here's a sobering fact. All these clever ideas, smart people, and major investment have not stopped Microsoft from being overtaken in the last year in terms of market value by Apple, which seems to focus on the customer experience now, rather than five years down the line.\nBig, sleepy, and dull, I suggested to Mr Mundie, is how many people now perceive Microsoft.\n\"We don't feel big and sleepy or dull,\" he responded, \"but if people perceive us that way I think looking at the stuff that Kinect brings should change that view.\"\nAnd he insists that firms that do not have the patience to spend on long-term research will lose out in the end.\n\"I don't think any company is going to prevail over a long period of time in giving good business returns, if they aren't making these kind of investments. They'll come and go in a generation if they don't have the staying power that's produced by having real mastery of the underlying technologies.\"\nMicrosoft, which still generates huge revenues from its core products, Windows and Office, can well afford to keep spending on its blue-sky thinking. But having made such a big bet on science, it will be hoping that the coming years will produce more Kinects, and fewer tablet PCs.",

An infection got into the bone and then spread to her hip.\nShe was seriously ill when she arrived in a US hospital - her immune system was going into overdrive in an attempt to fight the infection causing inflammation throughout her body.\nThis escalated and ultimately she died from septic shock.\nSamples of the infection taken from the wound were sent to the CDC for testing.\nThey showed she was infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae - which normally lives in the gut without causing disease.\nThe analysis found the superbug was resistant to all 26 available antibiotics in the US including the \"drug of last resort\" - colistin.\nThe CDC said: \"[Infections] that are resistant to all antimicrobials are very uncommon.\"\nBut the case remains a warning of the dangers of what the CDC calls untreatable \"nightmare bacteria\".\nSome scientists have argued we are on the cusp of the \"post-antibiotic era\" with cases like this in Nevada becoming more frequent.\nDr David Brown, chief scientist at Antibiotic Research UK, said: \"It is still quite unusual for a bacterial infection to be resistant to such a large number of antibiotics.\n\"Fortunately it is an extreme case, but it may soon become all too common.\n\"It happened because of her personal history of multiple hospitalisations in India, however, the ease of global travel does mean that such cases will increase.\"\nThe tests showed the bacteria did have low levels of resistance to fosfomycin - but that is approved in the US only as an oral treatment for uncomplicated cystitis.\nProf Laura Piddock, from Antibiotic Action and the University of Birmingham, said: \"Despite such multi-drug resistant bacteria being rare, this report is a salutary tale of the dire outcome for some patients when potentially useful drugs are not available.\n\"In circumstances such as this, where doctors are faced with the inability to treat a life-threatening infection, they need the flexibility to use antibiotics licensed for use in other countries and shown to be active in the laboratory against the patient's infecting bacterium.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",

But they would just come back with the mere argument of revenge.\n\"They would say: 'Look you have not been out there in Somalia during this whole war - we've been there and we've seen the kind of attacks by the Ugandan forces and African Union forces, the kind of raids they conduct and this [Kampala attack] is nothing compared to what we've seen out there.'\"\nMr Kimathi believes that despite being brainwashed, it is still very possible to pull sympathisers back from the brink of committing violence.\n\"One thing that needs to be done is to identify people who have that kind of mindset, reach out to them - which is rarely done - and show them that they belong, people care about them and that people are not hunting them - because they feel they are hunted.\"\nOutside the Jamia Mosque in the centre of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where worshippers were being screened with metal detectors before praying, people told me why they thought young men were being enticed to join groups like al-Shabab.\n\"Our young people are being used,\" says one man leaving the mosque.\n\"They don't have a job and if someone offers them some little money they'll do anything.\"\nAnother man said: \"They are too desperate to earn money - some are earning less than $1 (\u00c2\u00a30.60) a day so they are easily misused.\n\"This person is willing and ready to do anything that is offered to him.\"\nHe said a solution could be found in Islamic schools, or madrassas.\n\"But the teachers there need formal education so they understand the importance of getting a proper education.\n\"A lot of money comes to Kenya through free primary education but those madrassas are left out.\"\nThere are counter-radicalisation programmes in Kenya but some analysts suggest they rely too heavily on a counter-terrorism approach - with the police and army leading the way.\n\"There are still plenty of existing grievances in Kenya and in the wider region that mean people will be animated by the kind of issues that fuel al-Shabab and will be determined to join either al-Shabab or other networks allied to al-Qaeda,\" says Cedric Barnes, project director for the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group (ICG).\nThose social grievances include marginalisation not just in north-east Kenya, where most Somalis live, but also in coastal districts.\nWhile in any big city, particularly Nairobi, there will be people who feel they are not getting a chance.\n\"Young men in particular, I think, suffer from feeling overlooked and not getting opportunities that they see others getting,\" says Mr Barnes.\nAl-Shabab has been severely weakened inside Somalia where it has lost territory to the foreign troops fighting under the banner of Amisom over the past two years.\nSeptember's Westgate shopping centre attack seemed to be sending out the message - \"we are not a finished force\" - but al-Shabab also hopes to provoke a reaction which will boost the group.\n\"The Kenyan people and government now control the next move,\" Somalia expert Ken Menkhaus wrote on the American political blog, ThinkProgress.\n\"If they respond to this terrible tragedy with restraint and respect for due process and rule of law, they will do more to undermine al-Shabab than all of the counter-terrorism operations conducted inside Somalia.\n\"If the deadly attack succeeds in prompting vigilante violence by Kenyan citizens or heavy-handed government reactions against Somali residents, al-Shabab stands a chance of recasting itself as the vanguard militia protecting Somalis against external enemies.\n\"It desperately needs to reframe the conflict in Somalia as Somalis versus the foreigners, not as Somalis who seek peace and a return to normalcy versus a toxic jihadi movement,\" writes Mr Menkhaus.\nMr Kimathi also knows there is a danger of playing into al-Shabab's hands, because he has seen the way young people have reacted upon release after years in detention.\n\"They come out angry and indeed you would even hear in the first minutes of release somebody coming out and saying: 'I am going to [get] revenge - I cannot stand these sort of injustices any more.'\n\"Right now there is so much sympathy for the authorities, even from those people who have stood at the borderlines of extremism,\" Mr Kimathi says.\n\"If they can see the investigation and operations are being conducted within the bounds of some civil order then there is going to be quite a lot of collaboration and co-operation.\"\nBut what if there is a heavy-handed response?\n\"Then they risk feeding into the vicious cycle of recruitment and offering fodder for more terrorist propaganda,\" Mr Kimathi warns.",

This was followed by rocket and machine-gun fire from aircraft, he said.\nJust a day ago, aid workers in Geneva were \"almost celebrating\" one said, because all the necessary permits had been received, all the warring parties had been notified, and a convoy was finally going to Aleppo province.\nThe 31 lorries were carrying supplies for 78,000 people in Urum al-Kubra. But this morning, the optimistic mood had changed.\nAid workers familiar with some of the world's most brutal conflicts were in shock, some close to tears, others expressed disgust. Vitamins and blankets, books and pencils for children, medicines to treat burns or diabetes have all been destroyed.\nThe head of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent's office in Urum was killed, dying of his injuries as he waited hours to be evacuated. Now the UN and the Red Cross have suspended aid deliveries. Millions of Syrians who had hoped the brief ceasefire might bring some relief will, a Red Cross spokesman said, go on suffering, \"and they have been for years\".\nBan Ki-moon, in his final address as UN Secretary-General to the UN General Assembly in New York, said many groups had killed innocents in Syria \"but none more so than the government of Syria, which continues to barrel-bomb neighbourhoods and systematically torture thousands of detainees\".\nHe called the attack on the aid convoy \"sickening, savage and apparently deliberate\" and called for those responsible to be held to account.\nA UN spokesman said earlier that the convoy had received proper permits, and all warring parties - including Russia and the US - had been notified.\nThe President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, denounced the attack as a \"flagrant violation of international humanitarian law\" and said it could amount to a war crime.\nSyrian Red Crescent President Abdulrahman Attar said: \"It is totally unacceptable that our staff and volunteers continue to pay such a high price because of the ongoing fighting.\"\nThe US expressed \"outrage\" over the attack. Washington said it would \"reassess the future prospects for co-operation\" with Russia - an ally of Syria's government.\nAid deliveries to besieged areas had been a key part of the cessation of hostilities deal brokered last week.\nThe convoy was being unloaded at a Red Crescent warehouse when the attack began. The warehouse and a nearby health clinic were also badly damaged.\nThe Syrian military and rebels have accused each other of widespread violations.",

He died in August 2014.\nThe Scottish government said it was considering introducing a deadline for patients to be given scan results.\nIn 2009 ministers set a target that no-one should wait more than six weeks for key diagnostic tests to be performed.\nHowever, in June of this year, 6,448 people had waited longer, a figure that has risen four-fold in just two years.\nWhile there is a target for receiving tests, there is no similar target for analysing them and telling people the results.\nMr Docherty's daughter, Catherine Oliphant, said her father, who was from Airdrie, had a lesion in his liver which nobody had told him about.\nShe added: \"There was no follow up, nothing.  It was progressive, aggressive cancer. If he had known sooner, would it have been operable? Would he have had longer with chemotherapy? We're never going to know.\"\nThe Royal College of Radiologists says waits have risen because its workload is \"unsustainable\".\nConsultant radiologist Grant Baxter said: \"We are very much a specialty under pressure. We want to have the best environment for patients but we can't do that on current numbers.\n\"For a country the size of Scotland we have half the radiologists per head of population compared to the rest of the western world. We need to increase these numbers. Radiology and imaging is at the beginning of a process and without it, other treatment can't go ahead.\"\nIn June, more than 60,000 people were waiting for key diagnostic tests, which include radiology, ultrasound, MRI and CT scans, and endoscopies. They are essential to diagnose serious illness including cancer.\nLast month the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman strongly criticised NHS Lanarkshire for failing to tell Mr Docherty the results of his scan.\nNHS Lanarkshire apologised to Mr Docherty's family and said it would ensure action was taken to address the issues raised.\nThe Royal College of Radiologists says the workload of radiology departments has risen by 11-13% every year but this has not been matched by an increase in staff.  It says 45 jobs are currently \"underfilled\".\nMr Baxter added: \"The workload has increased but also the complexity has increased.\n\"If I look at my job now compared to 25 years ago it is almost completely different. We do a lot more in radiology. We do work surgeons used to do.\n\"At night, if you have a bleeding patient the radiologist is the person who is going to come in and cure them in a lifesaving procedure. We treat cancers now by putting a needle into a patient and heating it up.  It's a lot more time consuming, therefore we need a lot more radiologists to do this work.\"\nThe Scottish government said a comparison of waiting times over a longer period showed a trend of improvement.\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison said: \"Under this government there have been advances. For example, in 2006, more than 10,600 patients were waiting more than nine weeks for these tests.\n\"In contrast, statistics for this summer show that fewer than 6,500 people were waiting more than the shorter timescale of six weeks.\n\"That is an encouraging long-term trend but there is substantial rising demand, with 75% more patients for diagnostics in the last five years and we know we need to cut waits further for these key tests and drive improvements.\"\nThe government had also expanded the number of  consultant clinical radiologists by more than 40%, she added.\nMs Robison later told BBC Scotland: \"We're in the middle of looking at targets as part of the national conversation and I have to say is what I'm told all the time is that we have too many targets.\n\"We need to get the right targets and certainly that's something that I'm willing to consider.\"",

In severe cases it can leave the child with insufficient energy to keep their heart beating, sustain the brain or move muscles.\nMitochondria are passed on only from the mother, so a second donor egg is needed to create healthy children.\nBut as mitochondria have their own genetic code, it means resulting children have DNA from three people.\nThey would have 0.1% of their DNA from the second woman - a permanent change that would be passed down through the generations.\nNucleus: where the majority of our DNA is held - this determines how we look and our personality\nMitochondria: often described as the cell's factories, these convert food to usable energy to make the cell function\nCytoplasm: the jelly-like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria\nBoth the Commons and the Lords approved regulations to allow the creation of such babies in 2015.\nAnd reports by the Nuffield Council of Bioethics and the HFEA concluded the process would be ethical.\nBut the final safety checks held things up and new concerns emerged that the procedure would fail in one in eight pregnancies.\nThe HFEA's science advisors concluded last month that it was time to start.\nProf Robin Lovell Badge, one of the advisors, told the BBC at the time: \"We're not going to learn much more now unless you try it out for real basically - it's at that stage.\n\"There's no reason why it shouldn't go ahead now, but do it cautiously on selected patients where the risk of having a badly affected child is very high.\"\nThe woman who lost all seven children\nEvery time Sharon Bernardi became pregnant, she hoped for a healthy child.\nBut all seven of her children died from a rare genetic disease that affects the central nervous system - three of them just hours after birth.\nWhen her fourth child, Edward, was born, doctors discovered the disease was caused by a defect in Sharon's mitochondria.\nEdward was given drugs and blood transfusions to prevent the lactic acidosis (a kind of blood poisoning) that had killed his siblings.\nFive weeks later Sharon and her husband, Neil, were allowed to take Edward to their home in Sunderland for Christmas - but his health slowly began to deteriorate.\nEdward survived into adulthood, dying in 2011 at the age of 21.\nNow Sharon is supporting medical research that would allow defective mitochondria to be replaced by DNA from another woman.\nThe UK was the first country in the world to legalise the creation of three-person babies - much of the science has been developed by researchers at the University of Newcastle. .\nHowever, the child will not be the first to be born through the three-person technique.\nA Jordanian couple and doctors in New York performed the procedure in Mexico and the resulting baby is understood to be healthy.\nRobert Meadowcroft, the head of Muscular Dystrophy UK, said Friday's decision would be \"life-changing for many\".\n\"This is the final move towards clinical trials using an approach to give thousands of women living with devastating and unpredictable mitochondrial conditions the choice to bear their own unaffected children,\" he said.\nBut Dr David King, from the campaign group Human Genetics Alert, warned: \"This decision opens the door to the world of GM designer babies.\n\"Already, bioethicists have started to argue that allowing mitochondrial replacement means that there is no logical basis for resisting GM babies, which is exactly how slippery slopes work.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",

It is expected to report in December.\nThe second will be led by former Court of Appeal judge Dame Janet Smith DB and will examine the culture of the BBC during the years that Savile worked there. The results are expected in spring 2013.\nPanorama found that at an awards luncheon at the Hilton hotel on 2 December 2011, BBC director of news Helen Boaden told Mr Entwistle, the then director of Vision - which oversees BBC TV commissioning and programming - about the Newsnight investigation and its possible impact on the planned tributes to Savile.\nMs Boaden told him that if the Newsnight investigation went ahead, he might have to change the Christmas schedules. The conversation is said to have taken \"less than 10 seconds\".\nBoth Mr Entwistle and Ms Boaden have not provided responses to the points raised by Panorama.\nJohn Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee - which will take evidence from the director general on Tuesday - said the reasons for dropping the Newsnight report remained unclear and insisted Mr Entwistle had serious questions to answer.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Whittingdale said: \"If you were the director of Vision, you were told at the time you were commissioning programmes paying tribute to Jimmy Savile that Newsnight might be about to reveal a bombshell, you wouldn't just have a 10-second conversation.\n\"You'd say, 'tell me more, I'm about to go public putting out these programmes making out that Jimmy Savile was this saint'.\n\"And yet it appears from this he didn't even ask a question about what the Newsnight investigation was about.\"\nBoth Mr Jones and fellow Newsnight journalist Liz MacKean told Panorama that the story they had worked on for a month was halted when they felt it was close to transmission.\nMr Jones said he was certain the story would eventually come out and the BBC would be accused of a cover-up.\n\"In fact I wrote an email to Peter saying 'the story is strong enough' and the danger of not running it is 'substantial damage to BBC reputation'.\"\nLiz MacKean said of Mr Rippon's decision to drop the story: \"All I can say is that it was an abrupt change in tone from, you know, one day 'excellent, let's prepare to get this thing on air' to 'hold on'.\"\nShe added: \"I was very unhappy the story didn't run because I felt we'd spoken to people who collectively deserved to be heard and they weren't heard and I thought that was a failing... I felt very much that I'd let them down.\"\nMs MacKean also expressed concern about how the decision to abandon the story has been portrayed at the highest levels of the BBC as being about Surrey Police's investigation.\nSpeaking to Panorama she said: \"Ever since the decision was taken to shelve our story, I've not been happy with the public statements made by the BBC. I think they're very misleading about the nature of the investigation we were doing.\n\"The story we were investigating was very clear cut. It was about Jimmy Savile being a paedophile and using his status as a charity fundraiser and television presenter to get access to places where there were vulnerable teenage girls he could abuse.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC, Radio 4's Media Show presenter, Steve Hewlett, said the way the organisation had explained its reasons for dropping the Newsnight report were at best partial and arguably misleading - and had fuelled suspicion about corporate influence in the decision.\nOn 5 October 2012, the BBC's Mr Entwistle wrote to staff about the controversy: \"The BBC Newsnight programme investigated Surrey Police's enquiry into Jimmy Savile towards the end of 2011.\"\nMr Jones immediately emailed Mr Entwistle taking issue with that account. He wrote: \"George - one note - the investigation was into whether Jimmy Savile was a paedophile - I know because it was my investigation. We didn't know that Surrey Police had investigated Jimmy Savile - no-one did - that was what we found when we investigated and interviewed his victims.\"\nVeteran BBC foreign editor John Simpson said the questions swirling around the BBC's handling of the Newsnight investigation is the worst crisis to hit the public broadcaster in his almost 50-year career.\n\"All we have as an organisation is the trust of the people, the people that watch us and listen to us and if we don't have that, if we start to lose that, that's very dangerous I think for the BBC.\"\nPanorama: Jimmy Savile - What the BBC Knew, BBC One, Monday, 22 October at 22:35 BST and then available in the UK on theBBC iPlayer.",

It would support a south east/north east Wales plan, although it was at the \"limit of acceptability\".\nIt was also suggested it would be difficult for the Welsh Government to manage the financial challenge of holding the games.\n\"This level of financial commitment would be unprecedented, extremely challenging, and allow almost no flexibility in budget allocation should Welsh Government priorities change over the intervening years,\" the report said.\nNeil McEvoy, Plaid Cymru shadow minister for sport, said: \"Any departmental study I commissioned would have focused on how to achieve economic benefits.\n\"We should have had a plan to make a profit.\"\nWelsh Secretary Alun Cairns has said that Wales should have bid to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games to show it was \"open to the world\".",

        "source_text": "The yellow and black painted walls still mark out the Tigers' territory at Meadow Park, their residence since 1986.\nBut inside the ground, it is like the ghost of football past.\n\"When you see it in this state it brings a lump to my throat,\" supporters' trust chairman Lee Mills told BBC Sport.\nIt is the first time Mills has stepped foot in his club's home since it was devastated by a third major flood in 17 years, in the so-called summer of 2007.\nThe grass on the pitch is eight feet tall and littered with rogue trees and recycling bins. Seats have been ripped up, the roofs of the dugouts have caved in.\nThe directors' box - supposedly the best view in the house - is surrounded by smashed glass, and a dishevelled mattress suggests that the space has become shelter for someone who, like the club, is homeless.\n\"It still looks so familiar,\" Mills added, standing in his beloved T-end stand. \"The paint on the far side I remember vividly. I painted that on a Sunday afternoon. We were so proud of our stadium.\"\nWhen the River Severn burst its banks after three days of torrential July rain and spilled into Meadow Park, the water reached the top of the crossbar of the goalposts - that image, captured by fan Neil Phelps, became synonymous to the situation.\nThe deluge eventually subsided, but it left a trail of destruction.\nAnd after six years of setbacks, the Conference North club have no 'home' to host League Two Fleetwood in the FA Cup on Saturday.\nInstead, they will once again travel 12 miles to their temporary base at Cheltenham Town for their first round tie.\n\"The fans do their best,\" said life-long supporter Matt Yates of their attempts to make Whaddon Road feel like home. \"We put our flags on the seats to hide some of the red.\"\nAnd Mills admitted: \"We've got used to the nomadic lifestyle. If we had a home ground tomorrow I don't think a lot of us would know how to run it.\"\nLast year, there was genuine hope among fans that after five years on the road - first at Forest Green before Cirencester then Cheltenham - Gloucester were on their way home.\nWith the financial backing of owner Eamonn McGurk, the board had worked for three years on the perfect plan to build a brand new ground, within the original boundaries, which included flood defences and substantial business development in the area.\nBut in September 2012, they received the news that Gloucester City Council could not approve the plans without more detailed flood risk assessments - which would cost up to \u00a3100,000.\nIt put them back to square one and financial problems started to escalate.\nWith less people willing to travel to a 'home' game, little money was coming in. In one game, against Droylsden, only 142 supporters turned up, meaning the Tigers were left with \u00a321 profit.\nLast season ended with players deferring their wages and with Gloucester struggling to pay rent.\n\"I used to have dark hair when I started. Now it's grey and falling out,\" said chairman Nigel Hughes, only half-joking.\nFinances are now balanced, albeit precariously, and scaled-down plans for the stadium have been drawn up ready for submission.\nHughes confirmed the troublesome flood assessments will be handed to the Environment Agency in the next four to six weeks, and then the club will again have to wait to see if the plans are finally approved.\n\"We need it before the new year to give everyone a boost,\" he continued.\n\"I'm reconciled to playing in Cheltenham for the next 18 months but if we got the decisions through by the end of the year, we could really address it then.\n\"We've experienced some strange decisions in the past and I can't say 100% that we're going to get everything signed off, but my gut feeling is that we will.\"\nBut gut feelings may not be enough for some fans. They want a definitive action plan.\n\"The fact we're not even close to being back here is so depressing,\" said Matt Phillips, who joins Mills and Yates in the supporters' trust.\n\"In my mind, the best route home is the quickest route home. It's time the focus is shifted a little bit on to the people who are responsible for us being away from Gloucester.\"\nMills concurs: \"It's been tiring. It's tiring to have to travel an hour for a game. I'm constantly having questions from fans saying 'what's the latest on the ground? Are we coming back?'. It's tiring to have to give the answer of 'I don't know'.\"\nAs a supporter himself, Hughes empathises with the people in the stands. But as the voice of the people in charge, he insists they are doing all they can.\n\"There's been some people on the outside who have been happy to knock the efforts of those who have tried hardest to sort this,\" he said.\n\"It's very easy to spend other people's money and talk about how it should be done. There's been a lot of money invested to keep us at this level.\n\"Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Knowing what we know now we would have done things differently. However, we can't go back. We are where we are and we have to focus on the positive news that will hopefully come forward.\"\nWith all the hoopla of the stadium, it is easy to forget Gloucester's achievements on the pitch.\nThe Tigers won promotion from the Southern League in 2008-09 and this is the second consecutive season they have reached the money-spinning FA Cup first round.\nThey have already earned \u00a324,000 from their run in the qualifiers and are set to pocket a further \u00a36,750 from TV highlights of their game with former non-league rivals Fleetwood.\nThe money they have already earned from their cup run alone would virtually pay the rent at Cheltenham for another year.\nBut without a firm resolution to their future, some are struggling to take the positives.\n\"This season has been the worst since going away. I'm a patient person but after six years of waiting around I'm getting frustrated. We want a spade in the ground,\" said Yates.\n\"I was brought here by my parents. That's what we are missing now. We are missing a whole generation of kids.\n\"Something needs to happen soon otherwise I fear we will lose the club. And what are we going to do on a Saturday afternoon if there's no football to watch?\"",

        "source_text": "It's best summed up in the saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste - an aphorism so seductive that it has been attributed to all the usual historical suspects, from Machiavelli to Winston Churchill.\nIt is perhaps in this spirit that the European Parliament has been debating how the EU is going to work in future, in the looming shadow of Brexit.\nThe UK's vote to leave the EU, last June, came as a seismic shock to most MEPs. And many are quite open in their view that it amounts to a self-destructive decision by the British to uncouple themselves from one of modern history's primary drivers of peace and prosperity.\nBritish Eurosceptics of course would cast the Brexit vote in an entirely different light, and now foresee a future in which the UK will be free to make its fortune - and make its own new global trading relationships - unfettered from the dead hand of stifling Brussels bureaucracy.\nIt will be years of course - perhaps many years - before we know who is on the right side of that debate.\nBut one consequence of Brexit is already with us - the EU is now free to debate how it might work in the future without any input from the UK.\nIn theory that should leave Europe's federalists freer to dream than they have been in the past. Britain's voice has generally been raised to question the wisdom and value of further integration that would give EU institutions greater powers at the expense of individual national governments.\nYou would expect such dreams to be articulated best by Guy Verhofstadt - the former prime minister of Belgium, who now leads the liberal bloc in the European Parliament and who will represent that body in Brexit negotiations.\nIn the debate on future reform Mr Verhofstadt said: \"The union is in crisis. The European Union doesn't have much friends: not at home, not abroad.\n\"The Union does not deliver anymore. Rather than to talk about an 'ever closer union', we have a union of 'too little, too late'.\n\"That's why people are angry: they see all these European institutions, all these summits, all these empty words, but they don't see enough results.\"\nMr Verhofstadt has a long list of suggested fixes for this continental malaise, including reducing or ending the right of individual members to opt out of collective decisions - something no British government would ever have countenanced.\nHe has other ideas for how the EU should respond to Brexit too - including moving out of London the headquarters of two EU agencies: the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency.\nBut for now, at least, it seems radical visions for reform will be quietly kicked into touch.\nThe vice-president of the EU Commission, Frans Timmermans, politely welcomed the display of \"vision\" in the proposals, but noted that most of the suggestions would require EU treaty change. He said simply: \"We have to acknowledge that treaty change is not on the top of the political agenda now, in member states in particular.\"\nThere are plenty of true believers in the European project who would see in the Verhofstadt proposals the start of a kind of counter-revolution against events which have dismayed them - including Brexit, the US election of Donald Trump and the strong opinion poll showing of insurgent parties in a number of European countries.\nPopulist challenge brings Europe to crossroads\nBrexit: All you need to know\nBut for now a more cautious and pragmatic approach will prevail - partly because there is a general sense in Strasbourg and Brussels that the European institutions will have enough on their plates negotiating Brexit, without kicking off a parallel process of structural reform which would also take years.\nThat takes us back to the idea that every crisis is an opportunity that shouldn't go to waste.\nThere are, no doubt, those in Strasbourg who take that view - but it seems for the moment they are outweighed by those who feel that when you find yourself in the middle of a crisis - as they would see Brexit - the smartest course of action is to fix the crisis first and worry about the future later.",

It was horrible,\" she said.\n\"I'm concerned as to what was being injected because I thought that Botox had an instant effect.\"\nBotulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine meaning it is regulated by legislation.\nIt can only be prescribed by a doctor, dentist or nurse in a specific patient's name - and can only be used for that patient.\nOnce a prescription has been written, the Botox is purchased and dispensed from a pharmacy.\nIt is not illegal for an untrained person to inject Botox - but the Royal College of Surgeons said laws should be tightened to ensure only those with proper training administer it.\nHealth Education England has published two reports with guidelines on the qualifications individuals should have - but no new laws have yet been passed.\nJames Kearsey advertises his services via Facebook on the page Estetica Cosmetics, and also describes himself as a nurse.\nBut in November 2015 he was suspended by the NMC after hiding a conviction for assault from his bosses at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley.\nMr Kearsey agreed to a consultation at his home in Stourbridge, where he told our reporter he was a nurse consultant - \"the same level as a doctor\" - and that he makes thousands of pounds training others.\nHe sterilised her forehead and prepared to inject her before she told him she felt sick and left.\nWhen later approached by our reporter as he attended a clinic in Blackpool, Mr Kearsey said \"no comment\" and ran away.\nMr Henk, of Bromsgrove, admitted he knew what he was doing was wrong.\n\"It's actually almost like doing a brain operation without a licence, so it is actually quite a serious offence,\" he said.\nHe denied knowledge of patients having bad side effects and said it was very rare that anyone was unhappy with his work.\n\"It is very rare that people get bruises. You get the odd one or two.\n\"Everyone said they were really happy. It's quite upsetting to hear that people aren't happy.\n\"I am looking at stopping and I am looking for other jobs. It's just very difficult because you've got bills to pay.\"\nDespite breaking the law by prescribing the medicine, the legislation around cosmetic procedures continues to be a grey area.\nNHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh led a review into cosmetic surgery and non-surgical beauty treatments in 2013 in the wake of the PIP breast implant scandal.\nAnd while the government promised new rules meaning treatments would no longer be allowed to be administered by untrained workers, legislation has not yet been passed.\nThe NMC said it would investigate Mr Kearsey, adding: \"As he is currently temporarily suspended from the register he should not be undertaking any activity that would be done by a registered nurse, including prescribing medicines.\"\nA spokeswoman added: \"In relation to Mr Henk who has been struck off the register, he should not be claiming to be a registered nurse or undertaking any activity that would require him to be on the professional register, including prescribing medicines; to do so is a criminal offence.\"\nMandy Luckman is a clinical negligence lawyer for Irwin Mitchell who specialises in cosmetic surgery. \"The legislation around Botox is non-existent. And yet the industry is huge,\" she said.\n\"There have been many injuries reported. The government needs to take it seriously.\"\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"In adopting the recommendations of the Keogh Review, we are working to improve the safety of cosmetic interventions through better training and robust qualifications for practitioners.\"\n*Additional reporting by Rebecca Woods\nYou can see this story in full on BBC Inside Out West Midlands at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 7 March, or via iPlayer for seven days afterwards.",

The Bible speaks of it endlessly,\" he said.\n\"One of the problems is that we have this unbelievably complex tax system internationally and in each country, well in most countries.\n\"Somebody said the other day that the tax system is of biblical proportions, well the Bible is only 1000 pages, how many tax systems are only 1000 pages?\n\"They are several hundred times that.\n\"There needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place.\"\nMany global companies would agree with that wholeheartedly, arguing that governments aggressively compete with each other over tax rates and then complain when businesses follow the tax rules set by policy makers.\nI asked him if paying taxes was a moral issue.\n\"Yes of course it is - because tax is part of solidarity, tax is part of saying I belong to this place, I benefit from the fact that we have the police, a health service and a welfare system, we have external security - tax says I'm part of that and therefore I contribute to it.\"\nOf course, the Archbishop's words come just as the whole debate about the role of business in society has sparked into life.\nLast weekend, Labour attacked Stefano Pessina, the acting chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, for being based in Monaco.\nEd Miliband said Mr Pessina moved there to avoid paying taxes.\nMr Pessina also moved Boots Alliance headquarters to Switzerland before the merger with Walgreens last year, critics saying he did so for tax reasons.\nIt has since moved to the US.\nLabour's attack came after Mr Pessina suggested that a Labour victory at the general election would be a \"catastrophe\" for businesses.\nThe Archbishop clearly wants a broader debate than one between two groups who are supposedly either \"anti\" or \"pro\" business.\n\"I'm strongly in favour of the creativity of wealth and jobs and risk taking and all that goes with that,\" he told me.\n\"[But] with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power. There's a reality of the human condition, which Christians call sin, what the Bible calls sin - don't misuse the power you have through wealth.\"\nMany believe that the misuse of the power of wealth is evident in the increasing inequality reported by organisations such as Oxfam.\nI asked the Archbishop if some businesses were mis-using their power.\n\"When haven't they - in history?\" he replied.\n\"You find this in the book of Isaiah 800 years before Christ.\n\"There are always elements of where that happens because people are people.\n\"But you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and say that business is bad, you say that there needs to be solidarity and that there needs to be a regulatory framework that does not allow the abuse of power but gives the freedom for creativity.\"",

Sampson was so animated in his reaction that he ripped his shirt.\nBut England rarely tested Sari van Veenendaal - another Arsenal player - in the Dutch goal.\nJodie Taylor also shot straight at her Gunners club-mate from close range late on, but could still finish as the tournament top scorer with five goals.\nBut that will be no consolation to her or an England team who failed to take advantage of their ranking and who beat the Netherlands in Tilburg last November.\nEngland head coach Mark Sampson: \"Over the course of the tournament, we have been one of the of best teams here.

I'm not against schools using alternative provision as long as they take ownership of it.\"\nThe BBC has been given unique access to Ofsted's team of inspectors over the last month, travelling with them as they investigate unregistered settings.\nIn order to protect their identity, and the children, we are not naming the locations.\nBy law, anywhere that has more than five children full-time, or one child with special needs, has to register as a school.\nThat allows Ofsted to inspect the quality of the education the children are receiving.\nJust after 09:30 one morning the inspectors arrived at a community centre.\nThe inspectors found two rooms where teenagers excluded from mainstream schools were either following online learning programmes or going through basic lesson worksheets.\nThe establishment was not registered as a school but the children explained that they were there Monday to Friday and most expected to be there for around six weeks.\nThe pupils were being funded by local schools and the owner thought she was operating within the law.\nShe said that while they do not have any qualified teachers, and have far fewer lessons in a day, she believed they offered better pastoral support than schools.\nShe also thought schools were farming out their problem pupils because they could not manage them and that they were unable \"to give them one-to-one support and make sure they're not just sitting in isolation all day\".\nThe charity's other centre was a half hour drive away.\nThe inspectors' main concern was the building, a poorly maintained former youth centre, with no windows in the recreation room, litter on the floor and nothing on display on the walls.\nThis was a relatively easy case because the charity immediately started contacting schools to say it could no longer take pupils.\nSome of the inspection visits to ultra-orthodox Jewish, Muslim and Christian education centres are more complex.\nI spent a day in the Midlands with inspectors following up on leads and checking up on places they had already closed.\nUnregistered illegal schools are often set up in unconventional buildings such as disused offices or industrial spaces.\nThe trail took them to a building with signs up for a school, but it was locked.\nWithout realising it they also took me back to a place which I tried to investigate a year ago.\nThen I found a large former pub, where an Islamic education for primary school aged children was being advertised.\nThe inspector told me they had previously discovered more than 20 children being educated there, saying: \"The building, was cold and unkempt, and unhygienic.\"\nBut now they were satisfied it was just being used for adult religious instruction.\nAs we drove around the nearby streets they told me that four illegal schools had been closed down within a quarter of a mile of each other.\nThere is no shortage of places in local schools and all the children were found a place within 24 hours of Ofsted intervening.\nThe inspectors are gathering evidence on their visits that could be used for the first prosecution of an illegal school.\nWhat the inspectors have found has left Sir Michael deeply uneasy.\n\"It seems bizarre to me that a parent can take a child out of a school and not register them with the local authority.\n\"It seems not just bizarre but dangerous that they can't investigate what's happening to these children,\" he said.\nHe wants a tightening up of what he describes as the \"lax\" rules on alternative education.\nJoin the conversation - find us on Facebook",

But Ms Bouchart said: \"The fence makes everybody laugh.\"\nSome 7,500 migrants have been arrested in Calais this year. The UK has agreed to contribute \u00c2\u00a312m (15m euros; $19m) to help manage the situation.\nUKIP said it had sympathy with Ms Bouchart at having to deal with the disturbances in Calais but the UK needed to send a message that \"its streets are not paved with gold\".\n\"From her experience it is evident that even though Britain has not signed the Schengen Agreement, this country is adversely affected by the lack of European and French action on migration,\" said the party's immigration spokesman MEP Steven Woolfe.\n\"However, the problem she highlights is not one of the British welfare system, but of the way in which it can be misused.\n\"Welfare in the UK should be there for our own citizens, who have paid in, or whose family have paid in. It is not something for anybody turning up at our borders to be able to access.\"\nThe benefits that EU migrants can claim in another EU country vary across the 28-nation bloc but certain basic rules are enshrined in EU law.\nThe UK does not rank highest in terms of total spending on social security per inhabitant.\nAccording to the EU statistics agency Eurostat, the UK spent nearly \u00c2\u00a36,660 (8,000 euros) in 2010, with France, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands all spending more than 9,000 euros.\nAt the other end of the scale, spending in Bulgaria and Romania was below 2,000 euros.\nIn the UK, a bigger portion of welfare is funded by the state than is the case in Poland, France, Germany or the Netherlands.

But the gas is also used by doctors for its pain-relieving properties.\nA subsection of the Psychoactive Substances Act exempts medical products defined as \"restoring, correcting or modifying a physiological function by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action\".\nA man was tried at Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday for intending to supply nitrous oxide at a music festival in Derbyshire.\nBut prosecuting barrister Adrian Fleming told the court that the Crown's own expert witness, Professor Philip Cowen, \"is expressing the firm view that nitrous oxide, as the legislation is currently worded, is an exempt substance\".\nMeanwhile a judge at Taunton Crown Court, where two people were on trial for intending to supply nitrous oxide at Glastonbury Festival, came to the same conclusion.\nIn that second case, Judge Paul Garlick said \"nitrous oxide is plainly capable of coming within the definition of an exempted substance\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and in my view, on this evidence, it plainly is an exempted substance\".\nThe two court cases have prompted a full review of the legislation by the Crown Prosecution Service.\nThe Psychoactive Substances Act was designed to deal with a wave of new manufactured drugs, often called legal highs, by banning any substance which \"by stimulating or depressing the person's central nervous system... affects the person's mental functioning or emotional state\".\nThe law specifically exempts alcohol, tobacco or nicotine-based products, caffeine, food and drink and medicinal products as defined in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.\nIt is that last exemption that led the case to collapse.\nThe drug charity, Release, has described the law as \"fundamentally flawed\".\nIts executive director, Niamh Eastwood, said: \"The CPS must urgently drop all prosecutions under the Psychoactive Substances Act and review cases where defendants have previously pleaded guilty.\"\nMr Fleming told Southwark Crown Court that \"Professor Cowen has expressed the clear view that nitrous oxide falls within the definition because of its analgesic effects\".\n\"That may not have been the intention of those who framed the act, but the subsection clearly covers nitrous oxide.\"\nThe judge, David Tomlinson, instructed the jury to find the defendant - who cannot be named for legal reasons - not guilty.\nStressing that the hearing was not a \"test case\" and offered no precedent, Judge Tomlinson said the not guilty verdict could mean that either there was \"a very lucky defendant or a number of other defendants will have their convictions quashed\".\nIt is understood about 50 people have pleaded guilty to supplying nitrous oxide under the legislation, but this is the first time a defendant has contested the charge. Some lawyers are suggesting other substances may also be affected by the case.\nMr Fleming said the CPS had told him the situation demanded \"a full review of the legislation and that will be carried out\".\nHome Office crime survey figures published last month suggest 840,000 people in England and Wales used nitrous oxide in 2016-17. The silver canisters are a common sight at music festivals.\nThe gas was not considered harmful enough to be designated a controlled substance under existing drugs laws. In the last 10 years there have been 19 deaths associated with nitrous oxide, although a number of those are understood to have been suicides.\nThe collapse of two cases against people accused of intending to supply nitrous oxide is an embarrassment for the government, which had hailed the act as the answer to dealing with legal highs.\nBut during its passage through Parliament, ministers were warned that the law may be unworkable.\nDrug experts say the big test of the legislation is whether lawyers can prove that a substance is \"psychoactive\".\nThe Home Office is pinning its hopes on a new scientific experiment conducted in a test tube. The technique is designed to demonstrate whether a product binds to a particular receptor in the human body, affecting mental functioning or emotional state.\nBut ministers have been warned that such laboratory tests cannot prove that a substance affects the brain in a way that makes it psychoactive under the act.\nSome experts believe the only sure way to demonstrate a substance is psychoactive is to scan the brain of a human as they take it, which is an impractical approach.\nA similar problem blunted legal-high legislation in the Republic of Ireland.",

Nothing to do with the June Brexit referendum, but one of those bizarre encounters you sometimes have on the election trail.\nAs I was trailing Arlene Foster through the foyer of the Belfast Titanic Centre, she stopped to chat to a group of German tourists over for a fishing holiday.\nAfter a few pleasantries, one of the visitors revealed himself to be West Germany's entrant for the 1987 Eurovision Song contest.\nThat year Ireland's Johnny Logan won with \"Hold Me Now\".\nBut the singer from the improbably named group Wind obviously didn't bear a grudge as he told the first minister how much he loves travelling to Northern Ireland.\nShe in-turn revealed herself to be a Eurovision junkie, reminding me (in order to preserve her pro-Brexit credentials) that the song contest is not just for EU countries and even giving me a few bars of Johnny Logan's \"What's Another Year?\"\nThe DUP leader vowed to go off and search for the West German 1987 entry \"Let the Sunshine Into Your Heart\", but let's save her and you the effort.\nAfter that brief lesson in European musical history, let's return to education in a more traditional sense.\nIt was Mrs Foster herself who put it on the election map by hinting in last week's UTV debate that the DUP might - for a change - not pick the finance department first.\nInstead she indicated her party could listen to those urging them to take the education portfolio. However, this fell short of any solid undertaking.\nThen the Ulster Unionists used their manifesto to say that - if they return to the power sharing executive - they want to take education.\nThe UUP also proposed an alternative to the two privatised transfer tests which primary school children currently have to sit if they want to go to a grammar school.\nInstead, the party wants primary school teachers to preside over a system of continual assessment which would replace the exams whilst preserving an element of academic selection.\nOn Inside Politics, the outgoing Education Minister John O'Dowd spelled out why he doesn't believe the UUP assessment idea is workable. UUP leader Mike Nesbitt was subjected to further questioning on whether the teachers' unions would back continual assessment of primary school pupils on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show.\nOver the weekend, a survey by the polling firm Lucid Talk suggested education is top of voters' list of election priorities.\nOn the BBC's Sunday Politics, Dolores Kelly talked about the SDLP's backing for integrated education.  The SDLP manifesto criticised both the DUP and Sinn Fein, arguing their shared school campus initiative didn't go far enough.\nAlliance, which wants to see 20% of children in Northern Ireland in integrated schools by 2020, will no doubt have more to say on this score in their manifesto, due to be launched this week.\nAll the parties can say what they like about education, but will any of them be in a position to deliver change? If the DUP is the largest party then they can choose whichever department they want.\nHowever, much of the discussion about education stems from the cut in number of the Stormont departments, and the creation of a new single economy department merging enterprise with employment and learning (the latter department currently has responsibility for universities and colleges).\nThis has led to speculation that Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in might be tempted to take the new single Economy Department, rather than Education. However if John O'Dowd knows Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's thinking on this score he wasn't giving anything away on Inside Politics, despite persistent attempts to get him to divulge all.",

Get Me Out Of Here! and Celebrity Big Brother.\nShowbiz world pays tribute to Gest\nHe had planned to tour the UK in July with his latest show, called the David Gest Is Not Dead But Alive With Soul Tour!\nSeveral singers were due to appear on the tour, including Dina Carroll and Freda Payne.\nIt was named after the mix-up on this year's Celebrity Big Brother, when Angie Bowie informed Tiffany Pollard that David - meaning her ex-husband Bowie - had died during their time on the reality show. Pollard broke down in tears believing Gest, who was ill in bed at the time, had died.\nGest stayed in the Celebrity Big Brother house for 13 days but left the series on medical grounds.\nIn 2007 he was admitted to hospital with chest pains and respiratory problems.\nOne of the biggest successes during his career was producing the highest-rated special in US music history - 2001's Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration.\nHe was perhaps best known for his marriage to Minnelli. They were married in 2002 and officially divorced in 2007. He was also a childhood friend of Jackson and his brother Tito.\nGest's name-dropping anecdotes and raucous tales of showbiz friendships during his appearances on reality TV shows won him legions of fans in the UK.\nHe finished fourth in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here in 2006, and later became a judge on talent show Grease Is The Word.\nIn 2011, Sir Cliff Richard worked with Gest on his album Soulicious.\nGest helped develop the concept of the album, which saw Sir Cliff collaborate with soul singers including Roberta Flack and Candi Staton. He later produced and directed the Soulicious tour.\nMr Handi, who confirmed the news of Gest's death, described him as a \"huge talent\".\n\"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.\n\"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.\"\nA Metropolitan Police statement said: \"Police were called at 10:17 on Tuesday 12 April to the Four Seasons hotel, in Westferry Circus to reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s.\n\"London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel. A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed.\"\nPolice have said there appear to be no suspicious circumstances.\nGest was born on May 11 1953 in Los Angeles, California. He worked as a music video and television producer and last year he toured the UK with David Gest's (I've Had) The Time Of My Life Tour - which played 14 cities.\nHe released an autobiography, titled Simply The Gest, in 2007.\nLast month, Gest told the Hull Daily Mail: \"I don't live the showbusiness world in my private life.\n\"I don't go to many openings, or many premieres - that's not what I'm about, I did that more when I was younger.\"\nGest's appearance often hit the headlines, and he said having cosmetic surgery was his \"biggest regret\".\nFor the last few years of his life Gest lived in York - shying away from his former lifestyle in LA.\nHe told the Yorkshire Post in 2014: \"It's my home and the most beautiful place in the world. You look at the Minster, the cobblestone streets, the history with the Vikings and the River Ouse running through.\n\"It also has the York Hog Roast. People come by and see me eating there and I tell them I'm having my turkey and my Yorkshire pudding, my stuffing, my crackling, my vegetables and my gravy and I'm loving every minute of it.\"\nDespite his celebrity credentials, Gest prided himself on being a man of the people, telling the newspaper: \"I don't look at celebrity the way others look at it.\n\"I'm down to earth. People come up to me in the streets in York and I talk with everybody. I don't believe there's really a difference between any of us.\"\nGest married actress and singer Judy Garland's daughter Minnelli in 2002 in a star-studded wedding at New York's St Regis hotel.\nThe couple's 300 guests included Michael Jackson, Dame Joan Collins and Martine McCutcheon.\nJackson was the best man at the ceremony, arriving with matron of honour Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Ross.\nHis brothers Tito, Marlon, Randy and Jackie were among the groomsmen.\nMcCutcheon, together with actresses Mia Farrow and Janet Leigh and singer Petula Clark, was a bridesmaid at the ceremony.\nGest and Minnelli announced their separation a year later and divorced in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault.",

Anyone who witnessed the players trudge towards their Croatia team bus could feel the frustration radiating. They will not forget this easily, they will not forgive the referee, they were in no mood to celebrate.\nHowever, all over Sao Paulo, tens of thousands of Brazilians did just that.\nFireworks crackled in the night sky, car horns tooted in one street after another in this sprawling city. They sang and they shouted, they savoured the victory they so desperately needed.\nThey feted Neymar, the hero who stepped up when Brazil needed him most. The feeling, though, was mutual. This was country and football team in harmony.\n\"There were those that said the people didn't support the national team,\" Luis Felipe Scolari, the Brazil coach, said. \"We disproved that in Sao Paulo, we go forward together.\"\nTwo moments stood out above all else. The first was the national anthem, when Brazil, as they did last summer, sang on long after Fifa had shut off the music. It was rousing, it was spine-tingling, it was an outpouring of pride that brought a number of players close to tears and left Scolari himself wiping away moisture from his cheeks.\nThe second was the deep, rumbling roar that thundered around the stadium when Neymar's left-foot shot flicked off the post and into the net to bring Brazil level. The young forward raised a finger to the sky and ran to his coach for a mass touchline love-in between staff and squad.\n\"The first match is always difficult, we were anxious, we were nervous,\" Scolari said. \"Neymar is special. He needs to know that we know that.\"\nThe headlines were Neymar's, but they will gloss over the finer points. One was the poor goalkeeping between the Croatian posts. Neymar's mis-timed first effort may have been saved on another day, as might his second-half penalty. Oscar's third also found the net a little too easily.\nAnd Croatia refused to let go after the match that on another day the young Brazilian might have been sent off for catching Luka Modric with a swinging arm.\nEven with Neymar, Brazil looked vulnerable. Croatia's energetic midfield had the better of that particular battle for long periods, while in the full-back positions, Marcelo and Dani Alves were often caught out of position. Hulk and Fred failed to convince in attack.\nBrazil may not be this bad again, however. They are a side that craves momentum, a team that will grow in belief now that they are one step closer to achieving their dream next month.\nBigger challenges await, as do better teams. Brazil will, however, become harder to beat, harder to shackle as the tournament gathers pace and public support grows.\n\"It's important to start these tournaments on the right foot, with a victory,\" Neymar said. \"I'm happy that I got to score, but the entire team deserves credit.\"\nCroatia made Brazil look human for long periods. They pinned them back, restricted the fluency that became such a feature of the Confederations Cup.\nA year ago, Brazil had looked unconvincing in beating Japan 1-0, thanks to that man, Neymar. As then, Brazil face Mexico in their second match of the tournament. In the heat and intensity of Fortaleza, it promises to be another special occasion.\nIt should be remembered just how hard it is to beat Brazil on home soil. Their last defeat of any kind came by Paraguay in 2002. You have to go back to the 1975 Copa America to find a competitive defeat and that came against Peru. Few can match that.\nArguably the biggest positive of the day was the performance of Oscar. The week leading up to the day had been dominated by the Brazilian media asking questions about his form, his fitness and whether Willian, his Chelsea team-mate, should start.\n\"Oscar is pure, he is good, he is the child any father would like to have,\" Scolari said. \"He doesn't say anything. He didn't want to shut anyone up. Just to play.\"\nBoth sides displayed a freedom, both sought adventure before caution. If that approach continues it could be an absorbing and spectacular tournament.\nFor the best of BBC Sport's in-depth content and analysis, go to our features and video page.",

        "source_text": "State television showed Russian President Vladimir Putin watching the film last week, alongside Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in the Central Asian leader's capital Astana.\nThe clear message was that Russia and Kazakhstan are maintaining Soviet-era bonds of friendship, despite tensions in other parts of the former USSR. But the film itself - Panfilov's 28 Men - is based on a communist myth.\nThe film depicts an heroic act of self-sacrifice outside Moscow in November 1941.\nAccording to the Soviet mythology, 28 soldiers from the Red Army's 316th Rifle Division, mainly recruits from the Kazakh and Kyrgyz Soviet republics, stood unflinching against the advancing might of Hitler's Wehrmacht.\nThe men, from a larger division led by Maj Gen Ivan Panfilov, were all killed, but destroyed 18 German tanks before they fell.\nThe 28 were immortalised - posthumously decorated as Heroes of the Soviet Union - and Soviet children learnt about their last stand in school.\nYet historians say the story is not true.\nAn official Soviet investigation into the event, compiled in 1948, concluded that the story was the \"invention\" of a journalist from the Red Army's newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda. The reporter's account was at best exaggerated, and several of the men survived. The results of the probe were kept secret.\nBut the themes of the story chime with the Kremlin's worldview, and the state partly sponsored the new film.\nThe Kremlin promotes the idea of World War Two as a heroic victory that united the Soviet state against fascism - and still unites Russia today against a similar threat they say has resurfaced in Ukraine.\nThe USSR suffered the heaviest losses in the war - more than 20 million civilians and military - though scholars dispute the exact toll.\nThe film shows Kazakhs, Russians and other Russian speakers standing shoulder-to-shoulder to defend the Motherland. It echoes a Russian foreign policy concept: a Moscow-centred \"Russian World\" united by a common language.\nWhen, in June last year, Russian State Archive director Sergei Mironenko, citing historical documents, said the story was in fact a myth, he earned a sharp rebuke from Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky.\nMr Mironenko was removed as head of the archive in March this year.\nIn February 2013, President Putin ordered a single history syllabus for schools, offering a standardised narrative. A new state \"History\" TV channel was launched that year too.\nSupporters of Mr Putin's bid for a \"canonical\" history say it is needed in order to keep such a large state together. Yet critics see it as an attempt to impose one official version of the past.\nMr Putin and other officials have repeatedly talked about the need to counter the \"falsification of history\" or \"rewriting history\". They oppose interpretations of World War Two or other episodes of Soviet history that deviate from officially approved narratives.\nMr Putin's father was seriously wounded as a soldier on the Leningrad front.\nVladimir Putin: Russia's action man president\nRussia adorned with WW2 symbols\nChurch lends weight to Putin patriotism\nMr Medinsky, the culture minister, defended Panfilov's 28 Men, saying \"even if this story was invented from start to finish, if there had been no Panfilov, if there had been nothing, this is a sacred legend that shouldn't be interfered with. People that do that are filthy scum.\"\nIt is not the first time Russian officials have suggested that certain chapters of Russian history are sacred.\nIn January 2014, independent liberal broadcaster Dozhd TV came under attack. It was accused of smearing the memory of WW2 veterans by asking whether residents of wartime Leningrad could have been saved by surrendering the city to Nazi forces.\nThe public discussion of WW2 history has also been curbed by a controversial 2014 law against the rehabilitation of Nazism.\nUnder this law, Vladimir Luzgin, a blogger from Perm region in the Urals, was fined 200,000 roubles ($3,200; \u00c2\u00a32,500) for reposting an article about the war on the Russian social network VK (VKontakte), the daily Kommersant reported in July.\nThe court ruled that Luzgin posted an article with knowingly false information about a joint invasion of Poland by German and Soviet forces on 1 September 1939.\nAccording to the prosecutors, Luzgin realised that the text might instil in many people \"a firm conviction about negative actions of the USSR\" in the war.\nThe court said Luzgin had falsified history by stating \"that the communists and Germany jointly attacked Poland, unleashing World War Two, or in other words, that Communism and Nazism co-operated honestly\".\nIn September, Russia's Supreme Court ruled that the punishment of Luzgin was justified.\nNazi Germany and the USSR signed a non-aggression pact in August 1939 - the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In a secret protocol, they agreed to carve up Poland between them.\nNazi troops invaded Poland on 1 September and Soviet troops, from the east, on 17 September.\nRussia-Poland spat over WW2 cause\nIn another incident, last year, the authorities in Sverdlovsk region banned the works of two British historians - Antony Beevor and John Keegan - saying they were imbued with Nazi propaganda. The Vedomosti daily described (in Russian) the order to remove the books from public libraries as \"full of nonsense from start to finish\".\nPromoted by the state and personally previewed by Mr Putin, Panfilov's 28 Men may well prove a box office hit when it comes out in November.\nMany Russians may not know how the state embroidered the tale of Panfilov's men - but many may not care either.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Prime Minister Theresa May could then theoretically trigger Article 50, which formally starts the Brexit process, as early as Tuesday.\nHowever, Downing Street sources have said this will not happen this week and the PM is expected to wait until the end of the month to officially notify the EU of the UK's intention to leave.\nOnly two Tory MPs - Tania Mathias and Alex Chalk - defied the whip over the issue of EU nationals as the government won the first vote comfortably, aided by six Labour MPs who backed Theresa May.\nThere were no rebels in the second vote although 11 Tories abstained, including former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan, Dominic Grieve and Anna Soubry.\nOpening Monday's Commons debate, Brexit Secretary David Davis said MPs had already approved the bill \"without any strings attached\" and putting it into law \"without further delay\" would enable the negotiations to begin.\nHe said the government was committed to a \"quick deal\" on the rights of EU residents, but insisted guarantees must be reciprocal.\nHe repeated the government's verbal assurances that both Houses would have a vote on any Brexit deal, but warned that while the Lords amendment \"has been badged as a meaningful vote, the reality is there are some who would seek to use this to overturn the result of the referendum\".\n\"We will not have anything that will put the intention to leave the EU in doubt,\" he told MPs.\nBut he was pressed by a number of Tory MPs over the exact nature of the parliamentary vote they've been promised. Former minister Anna Soubry said it was \"perverse\" that if the UK and EU were not able to agree a deal at all, that Parliament would not be \"entitled\" to pass its judgement.\n\"I would urge the government, for the sake of bringing unity to the country at large, that they allow Parliament's sovereignty to reign and in the event of no deal we have a vote and a say,\" she said.\nFor Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said there was a \"compelling case\" to give EU residents the certainty they deserved, arguing that \"not only is it the right thing do in principle but it would set the right tone ahead of the negotiations\".\nFormer Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused ministers of \"shameful inaction\" on the issue, while Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said MPs \"were not elected to be lemmings\" in the Brexit process.\nThe SNP's Stephen Gethins said the question of the future of EU residents \"went to the heart of what kind of country we want to be\" and warned MPs not to hand the government a \"blank cheque\" in upcoming talks.\nBut the government won the backing of the vast majority of Tory MPs, including Dudley South's Mike Wood, who had been unable to vote during previous stages of the bill after being hospitalised with sepsis.\nHe tweeted: \"I'm still recovering from sepsis but I was determined to vote to make sure that the decision taken in last June's referendum is implemented.\"\nMrs May has said Parliament will get a vote, but some MPs and peers want a stronger commitment to give them a more \"meaningful\" say - and to be able to potentially send her back to the negotiating table in Brussels.\nMrs May has said she would rather take the UK out of the EU with no deal rather than a \"bad deal\".\nNo deal would result in trade rules defaulting to World Trade Organisation standards, meaning the UK and EU would be obliged to apply to each other the tariffs and other trade restrictions they apply to the rest of the world.",

        "source_text": "The stated aim of the aerial campaign was, in the words of US President Barack Obama, to \"degrade and ultimately destroy\" the Islamic State. However, if anything IS has shown surprising resilience and emerged more battle-hardened.\nAn analysis of their military strategy helps to explain why. At its core is the concept of \"Remaining and Expanding\", enunciated in the group's propaganda magazine Dabiq  in November 2014.\nPutting theory into practice, IS has remained in its putative capital Raqqa in Syria and in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. And just last month it expanded, seizing Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's Anbar province, and the strategic Syrian town of Palmyra.\nThe ultimate aim of Islamic State is global domination.\nToward that end it has divided the world into what the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, notes are \"three geographic rings: the Interior Ring in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria), the Near Abroad in the wider Middle East and North Africa, and the Far Abroad in Europe, Asia and the United States.\"\nEach ring has three military strategies attached to it - conventional warfare, guerrilla warfare, and terror attacks.\nAll three have been used to good effect in the Interior Ring.\nIn the Near Abroad, the impact of conventional and guerrilla war by IS affiliates is being felt, with numerous attacks on the military and police in Egypt's Sinai and the seizure of several towns in Libya, including the former Gaddafi stronghold of Sirte.\nMeanwhile, so-called \"lone wolves\" have brought terror tactics to the Far Abroad, with IS taking credit for attacks in Australia, the US and Canada.\nIn Iraq and Syria, tactics such as the use of Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIEDS), essentially suicide bombs on wheels, many of them US-built Humvees captured from fleeing Iraqi forces, have proved highly successful battlefield weapons.\nAdded to this are the droves of individual suicide bombers deployed both when attacking and when under attack.\nSmaller urban areas are overrun using a \"pinch manoeuvre\" with VBIEDS attacking from two sides, followed by jihadists wearing suicide vests and then by a wave of lightly armed and highly mobile vehicles and  foot soldiers.\nLarger cities are taken by a combination of infiltration, particularly into disenfranchised Sunni communities in Iraq and through what the ISW study calls the Belt Strategy: \"A way to organise a battle plan around a principle city using dispersed units, informal tactics and freedom of manoeuvre to compromise the main defences of a conventional enemy.\"\nIn this strategy first towns and villages surrounding large urban centres are taken, closing roads, and creating a belt of encirclement.  The belt is tightened as IS draws closer and begins to take control of the suburbs.\nIS uses the huge desert regions of both Syria and Iraq to its advantage, withdrawing into them and emerging from them almost at will, aided by a high degree of mobility and an organisational efficiency that keeps its soldiers in the field well supplied with both ammunition and water.\nAnd although the allied air attacks have disrupted large scale desert movement of troops and vehicles, IS has responded by breaking its forces into smaller, less detectable units.\nThe deserts are also useful in drawing overstretched government soldiers into committing large numbers of troops in what amounts to a feint by IS.\nThus, a relatively small number of jihadists can occupy a much larger force while their fellow fighters are attacking a strategic town, army base or other key installation such as a dam or oil refinery.\nAgainst that backdrop, the defence of the Syrian town of Kobane and the retaking of Tikrit in Iraq remain modest battlefield achievements.\nFor as the world is only now beginning to acknowledge, IS is a formidable, highly motivated and disciplined fighting force.  More than that it is an organisation with a well thought out, systematically structured and well proven battlefield strategy.\nCompare that to President Obama's recent admission that, after one year of war \"we do not yet have a strategy to defeat ISIS [Islamic State]\" and the full weight of the challenge ahead becomes ominous indeed.\nBill Law is a Middle East analyst and a specialist in Gulf affairs.

The assembly might end up choosing a successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is 76 and has suffered ill-health.\nWhat is the Assembly of Experts?\nIran elections: Five things to know\nElections highlight divisions\nPunchy politics on social media\nEarly results gave Mr Rafsanjani, a moderate Conservative, and Mr Rouhani respectively the most votes for the assembly, which is composed of mostly elder and senior clerics.\nBy contrast, the leading candidate of Islamic hardliners, Ayatollah Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, was hovering near the bottom of the list.\nFor parliament, former Vice-President Mohammad Reza Araf was topping the list for the capital with almost half the votes counted there. The only conservative so far was former parliament speaker Gholamali Haddad-Adel, in seventh place.\nThe result is significant because lawmakers from the capital usually determine the political direction of the house, analysts say.\nHowever they add that the picture may be more mixed in smaller towns across the country.\nMr Rouhani said the election gave the government more credibility and clout.\n\"The competition is over. It's time to open a new chapter in Iran's economic development based on domestic abilities and international opportunities,\" the official Irna news agency quoted him as saying.\n\"The people showed their power once again and gave more credibility and strength to their elected government.\"\nVoting was extended three times on Friday as crowds reportedly flocked to polling stations. Turnout was more than 60%.\nReformists, who want better relations with the outside world and more freedoms at home, are hoping to gain influence in the conservative-dominated bodies.\nBut of 12,000 people who registered as candidates, only half were allowed to stand, including just 200 moderates.\nThe results of the parliamentary election could take longer to emerge than for the Assembly of Experts and the parliamentary vote is likely to go to a second round in April.\nCandidates need 25% of the vote to win outright and there is an average of 17 candidates per seat. Elected MPs will serve four-year terms.\nThis was the first election to be held since last year's deal between Iran and world powers over the country's nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions.\nBBC Persian's Ali Hamedani says the economy was a key issue in the process.\nWith sanctions lifted and Western investors beginning to return to Iran, there are high hopes for an improvement in daily life, he says.\nReformists and moderates say they are targeting greater foreign investment which, our correspondent says, will create jobs for young people.\nMore than half of Iranians are under 35 but the youth unemployment rate is 25% - more than two and a half times the national average.\nHowever, conservatives say strong economic growth is more likely to come from domestic production in what they describe as a \"resistance economy\" that draws on the ideals of the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

If they vote to leave, the settlement will cease to exist.\"\nThe UK's negotiation \"was the first round\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the last\", he added.\nIf it walks, talks and smells like a treaty, then it is a treaty.\nWhat is important is the substance of the agreement and not the label \"treaty\".\nAs Mr Gove acknowledges, this is a \"deal between 28 nations all of whom believe it\".  In other words, all of whom intend to be bound by it.\nThe more significant question is, perhaps, what is the value and status of the deal as a matter of EU law?\nRead the rest of Clive's analysis\nMr Tusk was speaking at the first European Parliament session since the European Council summit where the reforms were agreed following drawn-out negotiations between leaders.\nBBC political correspondent Ben Wright in Brussels said there was some \"exasperation\" on show from some political groupings that they \"had been forced to go through this in the first place\".\nEarlier Downing Street responded to Mr Gove's comments on legality by citing Alan Dashwood, the former director of legal services at the EU, who said the \"Decision\" was a binding legal agreement reached by consensus and could only be amended or rescinded by consensus - or, \"in other words, with the agreement of the UK\".\nThe European Court of Justice was set up in the 1950s to ensure European law is interpreted and applied evenly in every EU country but many Tory MPs believe it has over-extended its jurisdiction and its powers should be rolled back.\nMartin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said the guarantee that the UK would be exempted from ever-closer union would be \"written exactly\" into the treaties in the form it was agreed last week and \"nobody can tell British voters other things\".\nAnalysis by BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\nMr Gove's comments will be catnip for Eurosceptics who've already been arguing that Mr Cameron's deal is hardly worth the paper its written on.\nFor David Cameron, maintaining the sense that the deal he's achieved can and will improve the UK's relationship with the rest of the European Union in a meaningful way is a vital part of his campaign.\nIt's one thing Tories from different parts, different generations of the party, disagreeing. It's quite another when it is two who have shared political hopes, ambition, and even family holidays.\nRead more from Laura\nJoshua Rozenberg: Does the EU impact on UK sovereignty?\nMr Wright, the government's senior law officer, told the BBC that although challenges could be brought to the European Court of Justice, the UK agreement had \"very similar legal strength\" to existing treaty obligations.\n\"The suggestion that this agreement does not have legal effect until it is incorporated into EU treaties is not correct. That is not just my opinion - it is the opinion of this government's lawyers, lawyers for the EU, and, I suspect, the majority of lawyers in this country.\"\nFormer attorney general Dominic Grieve told the BBC that Mr Gove was simply \"wrong\".\nBut the justice secretary's comments were seized upon by Conservative MPs campaigning for the UK to leave the EU.\nHuman rights minister Dominic Raab said: \"The last word on enforceability very clearly lies with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.\"\nSpeaking during the European Parliament session, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said lodging the document with the UN was \"completely meaningless\".\n\"You might as well lodge a pair of socks,\" he added.\nMinisters who want to quit the EU have been allowed special dispensation to oppose the government at the referendum, although strict rules have been put in place for the campaign.\nThe BBC has been told that following Mr Gove's interview, Downing Street ordered his officials to stop showing him documents concerning the EU.\nNumber 10 said Mr Gove was subject to the same rules as every minister arguing for the UK to leave the EU and the move was nothing to do with his comments.\nIn other referendum developments, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, said she thought the impact of the UK leaving the EU was \"bound to be a negative on all fronts\".\nShe added that it would be a bad development \"For those who stay, because there are fewer of them, and for those who go, because they lose the benefit of that facilitation of exchange.\"",

Transport policy and planning has instead prioritised safety and economic growth.\"\nThe authors say the existing vehicle fleet is being replaced so slowly that reduced vehicle use is the only sure way to bring about changes in pollution levels.\nThey say this will mean a huge push to encourage walking and cycling - measures that would also help combat obesity.\nDr Chatterton said: \"Air pollution-related morbidity and mortality are at epidemic levels - and, although less obvious, are more significant than road transport collisions as a cause of death and injury.\n\"There needs to be a strong political and societal commitment to protecting public health, particularly the health of children, whose life chances can be seriously compromised by exposure to air pollution.\n\"This will require not just improvements to transport infrastructure, but also changes across society in our expectations of how we, and those we connect with, get around.\"\nThe study included:\nRoad safety groups are likely to point out that although pollution harms young people, it tends to shorten the lives of those who are already ill or elderly.\nRoad deaths, on the other hand, are the principal direct cause of death for young people.\nAA president Edmund King told BBC News: \"Road transport is essential to keep the country running whether we like it or not, as 90% of freight and 85% of passenger journeys are by road.\n\"The ultimate aim is to keep the country running efficiently, safely and in a more environmentally friendly manner.\n\"Road vehicles are getting greener, cleaner and safer and government should do what they can to give incentives to speed up this process. Saving lives in road crashes won't suggest it should.\"\nBut Stephen Joseph from the Campaign for Better Transport said the research is a \"wake up call\" for local and Westminster politicians, as well as transport policy makers.\nHe said: \"Transport computer models and assessments need to be reviewed too - currently they give far too much priority to small savings in journey times by car drivers, so anything that gets in the way of cars is treated as a cost.\n\"We see all round the country traffic planners and government agencies coming up with big road schemes, that will in practice add to air pollution rather than solving it.\n\"We need to change transport spending priorities to support alternatives to cars.\"\nA government spokesman said it was \"firmly committed\" to improving the UK's air quality and cutting harmful emissions.\n\"That's why we have committed more than \u00c2\u00a32bn to greener transport schemes since 2011 and set out a national plan to tackle pollution in our towns and cities,\" the spokesman said.\n\"We have some of the safest roads in the world and are committed to making sure that record continues.\"\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",

        "source_text": "For months, if not years, it was a question of when, not if, Mrs Clinton would announce she is making a second bid for the US presidency. Now that question has been answered.\nWith the parlour guessing games over, Mrs Clinton faces the long, gruelling road that the US political system demands of its would-be presidential aspirants. The Iowa fairground flesh-pressing, the blustery New Hampshire doorstepping, the nonstop cross-country flights and seemingly interchangeable stump speeches, public rallies and fundraising events that drag on for month after endurance-ebbing month.\nAll of this takes place under the eternal scrutiny of a press corps hungry for a story and political opponents looking for the choice soundbite or misstep that can sink a candidacy.\nThis, of course, won't come as any surprise to the former secretary of state. She went through two presidential campaigns with her husband in the 1990s and her own bid - which came up just short to Barack Obama - in 2008.\nThis time around, however, Mrs Clinton's path to the Democratic nomination appears much easier. Unlike 2008 there's no inspirational, once-in-a-generation opponent like Mr Obama waiting in the wings. There's not even a charismatic, battle-tested candidate like former vice presidential nominee John Edwards or a Hispanic governor with foreign policy chops like Bill Richardson in the field.\nBut if Mrs Clinton's nomination campaign will be easier, actually winning the presidency could be just as difficult - or more so. Unlike 2008, the Democratic nominee will be defending eight years of her party's rule, with all the baggage that comes with it. Instead of facing a Republican Party on its heels, fresh from massive losses in both chambers of Congress, a nominated Mrs Clinton will have to defeat a Republican candidate with the political wind at his back.\nMrs Clinton also faces an ongoing congressional investigation into her response to the attacks on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya - which has already spun into controversy over her privately managed email server while secretary of state.\nIf this is Hillary's moment, she's going to have to earn it. And the mistakes that sunk her 2008 campaign against Mr Obama - if they aren't addressed - could prove equally fatal to her 2016 presidential efforts.\nMrs Clinton's first campaign was beset by bickering among her advisers, for instance. She replaced her campaign manager midway through the primary calendar, and every week it seemed there was a new anonymous leak, as various factions within her camp vied for power.\nMrs Clinton was also criticised for running a campaign that showed little personality - controlled to the point of appearing programmed. It's why the moments she did reveal a more human side, such as when she choked back tears in New Hampshire or touted the \"18 million cracks in the glass ceiling\" after conceding defeat - were so memorable.\nA lack of a unifying vision driving her candidacy has also been identified as a key flaw in her 2008 bid. She seemed content to run on her resume and ability to be \"ready on day one to solve our problems\". Such a nuts-and-bolts approach melted in the face of Mr Obama's appeal to transcending partisanship and \"hope and change\" rhetoric.\nSo will this time around be different? Mrs Clinton has put together a more diverse team of advisers - including some of the very Obama campaign veterans who beat her eight years ago. Early indications are she will attempt to soften her image by emphasising her new role as a grandmother.\nAccording to the Washington Post, she plans to launch a \"go-slow, go-small\" strategy of appearing in more personal venues to highlight her \"humour, humility and policy expertise\".\nAs for a reason why she's running \u2026 that remains to be seen. There have been hints that she will embrace the economic populist wealth-gap message most notably touted by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. She could also emphasise women's rights, both in the US and internationally - a subject that has been close to her heart for her entire career.\n\"Little by little, Mrs. Clinton is taking steps that suggest she has learned from the mistakes, both tactical and personal, of her failed candidacy,\" writes Amy Chozick of the New York Times.\nRepublican uber-strategist Karl Rove, not surprisingly, isn't buying it.\n\"She is someone searching for a rationale to run, rather than seeking how best to present it to the public,\" he writes in the Wall Street Journal. \"Slogans and soft lighting can't substitute for real convictions and an authentic sense of purpose.\"\nOnly Cruz and Paul have formally declared but these are some of the names to watch:\nMrs Clinton's candidacy has a lot going for it, of course. The simple fact that she's a veteran of national campaigns - and has faced the harsh spotlight for decades - is a strength that puts her ahead of most opponents, both Republican and Democrat.\nShe also won't want for money. Mrs Clinton, writes the Daily Beast's David Freedlander, is about to \"embark on a fundraising push that the Clinton camp says will dwarf anything seen in the history of presidential politics\" - topping the $1bn spent to re-elect Mr Obama.\nThere are also the built-in demographic advantages revealed by two straight Democratic presidential victories. The electorate that comes out in presidential years is increasingly diverse and youthful - and leans to the left.\nMrs Clinton - and Democrats in general - had best hope this trend continues and that Mrs Clinton is ready to run the race of her life.\nFor Hillary Clinton all this is one more - and likely last - chance to realise her lifelong personal ambition. But for Democrats - and left-leaning Americans in general - there's so much more at play. Given the paucity of the field of Democrats, and the current alignment of political power in Washington, DC, Hillary Clinton is the one - the only - hope for cementing the policy gains made over the last eight years.\n\"Her campaign has become a single point of failure for Democratic politics,\" writes the New Republic's Brian Beutler. \"If she wins in 2016, she won't ride into office with big congressional supermajorities poised to pass progressive legislation. But if she loses, it will be absolutely devastating for liberalism.\"\nIf she loses, Republicans in Congress and the executive agencies will have free reign to advance their policy agenda.\nHealthcare and financial reform passed under Mr Obama will be rolled back. Aging liberal Supreme Court justices could be replaced with young conservatives. Environmental regulations enacted through presidential action will almost certainly be lifted.\nFor Mrs Clinton the stakes are high. For Democrats, they couldn't be higher.",

However, the FSA has ordered Findus to test the lasagne for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or 'bute'.\n\"Animals treated with phenylbutazone are not allowed to enter the food chain as [the drug] may pose a risk to human health.\n\"The Findus beef lasagne was distributed to the main UK supermarkets and smaller convenience stores. Findus has already begun a full recall of these products.\n\"People who have bought any Findus beef lasagne products are advised not to eat them and return them to the shop they bought them from.\"\nMr Paterson said the presence of unauthorised ingredients \"cannot be tolerated\".\n\"The responsibility for the safety and authenticity of food lies with those who produce it, and who sell or provide it to the final consumer. I know that food producers, retailers and caterers are as concerned as we are at the course of recent events,\" he said.\nHe said the government was working closely with businesses to \"root out any illegal activity\" and enforce regulations.\n\"Consumers can be confident that we will take whatever action we consider necessary if we discover evidence of criminality or negligence,\" he added.\nShadow environment secretary Mary Creagh said the latest revelations raised questions about the extent of the scandal.\n\"This is no longer just a food safety issue but possibly a criminal trade,\" she said.\nFindus said the product was manufactured by a third party supplier and not by Findus.

Two samples were found to contain 80% horsemeat.\nThe horsemeat controversy has hit the Irish meat-processing industry, with a number of suppliers on both sides of the border affected.\nThe FSA has said it will co-ordinate a UK-wide survey of beef products to test for the possible presence of horse or pig DNA.\nThere will be \"additional emphasis on brands at the lower end of the market, particularly for burger-type products\", it said.\nTwenty-eight local authorities across the UK will take a total of 224 samples, and results are due to be published in April.\nThe survey \"aims to identify and understand factors that may lead to the presence of meat species that are not labelled as an ingredient, so that this can be explained, eliminated or correctly labelled\".",

        "source_text": "That was Mark Sims, the mission manager on the UK-led Beagle2 mission to the Red Planet, speaking at the publication of the team's own inquiry report into what went wrong.\nKnowing what we know now - with the pictures of an intact Beagle sitting on Mars - I asked Mark to reflect on those comments he made 11 years ago.\n\"My nightmare back in 2004 is probably pretty close to reality, unfortunately,\" he mused.\nIt should be some consolation to know that Beagle made it to the surface, but it is also deeply frustrating to realise that success was denied by such small margins.\nBeagle weighed an extraordinary 73kg all up. This included all the paraphernalia it needed to get down, including its entry capsule, parachute system and landing airbags.\nOn any mission, mass is the priceless commodity and Beagle was allocated very little.\n\"Sardines in a tin\" doesn't begin to describe how the components of the European Space Agency (Esa) \"pocket watch\" probe had to be packed together to save space and weight.\nAnd that ultimately may have been its downfall - a device wound too tight.\nEven with the new satellite pictures to hand, it is impossible to say definitively what happened.\nAll we know is that at least one, perhaps two, of its solar-panel \"petals\" failed to unfurl, and that this would have blocked its radio from calling home.\n\"The failure cause is pure speculation,\" says Mark, \"but it could have been, and probably was down to sheer bad luck - a heavy bounce perhaps distorting the structure as clearances on solar-panel deployment weren't big; or a punctured and slowly leaking airbag not separating sufficiently from the lander causing a hang-up in deployment.\"\nHe continued: \"We don't have the resolution to tell exactly what the Beagle2 configuration is on the surface, except it isn't consistent with a full deployment. We will collect more images and do more analysis and see if we can narrow down the possibilities - but we may never know.\"\nI have this nagging thought, though: what if Beagle had been allocated a bit more mass? What if the permitted margins had allowed the clearances inside to be just that little bit bigger?\nThe Mars Express (MEx) orbiter, which delivered Beagle to the Red Planet, continues to work to this day. One of the reasons for this is because it was given ample propellant - more than 400kg, a substantial fraction of the mission's launch mass.\nWhat if they hadn't filled the tank quite so full? \"What if?\" - the two most useless words in the English language.\nFast-forward to November last year and the eve of the Philae landing on Comet 67P.\nI'm talking now to Paolo Ferri, the head of operations at the European Space Agency's mission control in Darmstadt, Germany.\nI ask him when he will start to breathe during Philae's long journey down to the \"ice mountain\", and he identifies the moment when the Rosetta mothership re-establishes contact with the little probe.\nIf you remember, this radio hook-up was about two hours after the pair's separation, but still five hours from Philae's eventual touchdown.\nIt would mean, he said, you could then at least follow the probe all the way to the surface.\nAnd Paolo added: \"You're allowed to fail so long as you know why you failed.\"\nAnd this is the mantra that must guide all future European space landings.\nIf you look at the official inquiry into the Beagle failure, it chides the absence of communications through the descent. The not knowing. Its recommendations read:\nEurope's next big venture to the surface of Mars comes with the 2018 ExoMars rover (although there will be a landing technology demonstration in 2016 as well).\n\"The 2018 mission will have a UHF antenna in the Descent Module (DM) backshell and another one on the lander to relay data to [a satellite] in real time,\" explains Jorge Vago, the ExoMars project scientist.\n\"With some delay, we should receive knowledge of how the spacecraft performs at each of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) critical steps, e.g. supersonic and subsonic parachute deployment, ejection of heatshield, radar on, propulsion on, etc.\n\"Important additional information gathered during EDL will be stored on board and beamed back after landing - assuming we land successfully.  This will allow reconstructing the spacecraft systems' performance and atmospheric characteristics in detail.\n\"Additionally, I expect it will be possible to track the DM's UHF carrier signal (not the information) from Earth.  We may be able to get a bit of information from this as well.\"",

27.5 - is not unusually young.\nThe two youngest were 15 - an unnamed boy who attacked a Jewish teacher with a machete in Marseille, and Safia S, a girl who stabbed a police officer at a Hannover train station.\nOf the five who were under the age of 18 at the time, four were in Germany.\n15 Age of the youngest attacker\n27.5 Average age of attackers\n54 Age of the oldest attacker\nThe vast majority of the attackers were in their 20s, with about one in four attackers above the age of 30 and six aged 40 or older.\nThe oldest suspect, Mohamed H Khalid, was 54 when he was accused of stabbing to death an elderly couple in the Austrian city of Linz.\nIn the UK, Khalid Masood, was 52 when he drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge and stabbed to death a police officer at the Houses of Parliament.\nDespite women becoming increasingly active in jihadist networks, only two out of 85 individual perpetrators were female.\nFewer than one in five perpetrators was a convert to Islam, with a significantly higher percentage in North America than in Europe.\n74% were known to the authorities before attack\n50% had a criminal background\n26% had served time in prison\n64% were citizens of the country of attack\nHowever, the converts were significantly more likely to have a criminal background and to have served time in prison.\nOverall, half of the attackers had a prior criminal background.\nThe relationship between terrorism and migration is a complex one and has been at the centre of extremely polarising debates, particularly during the European migrant crisis.\nHowever, the number of attackers who were illegally in a country or who arrived as refugees is small.\nTwo-thirds were citizens of the country they attacked, with others either legal residents, or legal visitors from neighbouring countries.\nHowever, individuals who were in the West illegally also carried out deadly attacks.\nAt least two of those involved in the November 2015 Paris attacks are thought to have posed as refugees to enter Europe through Greece.\nThree other individuals were refugees or asylum seekers at the time of attack, while seven were in the country illegally or awaiting deportation.\nThe latter group includes Uzbek national Rakhmat Akilov, who killed four people with a hijacked lorry in Stockholm in April 2017, and Tunisian citizen Anis Amri, who also used a lorry to commit his attack at the Berlin Christmas market.\nThere is also one case of \"terrorist tourism\", involving Egyptian citizen Abdullah Hamamy, who lived in the United Arab Emirates and attacked soldiers at the Louvre in February 2017.\nTwo of the four most lethal attacks - those in Paris in November 2015 and in Brussels in 2016 - are believed to be well orchestrated multiple attacks directed by IS.\nThey were also executed in part by former foreign fighters.\nHowever, the two other most deadly attacks - those in Orlando in June 2016 and in Nice in July 2016 - were carried out independently by individuals without operational connection to a jihadist group.\nThese episodes demonstrate that terrorist sympathisers who never travelled to conflict areas and who act independently can be as dangerous as a team of highly trained militants.\nOverall, links between attackers and jihadist groups operating overseas are not always easy to determine.\nOf the attacks that have hit the West since June 2014, fewer than one in 10 was carried out under direct orders from the leadership of IS.\nIn some cases it can be difficult to tell, for example IS said it was behind both the Las Ramblas and Cambrils attacks, but it did not provide any evidence.\nNevertheless, the influence of IS can be clearly seen.\nDuring or before the attack, six out of 10 perpetrators pledged allegiance to a jihadist group, almost always IS - which frequently claims responsibility.\nUnsurprisingly, given the frequency of attacks and the number of deaths and injuries, jihadist terrorism has come to the fore of political debates in the West and receives widespread news coverage.\nThe threat is not expected to wane in the near future, with policymakers, counter-terrorism officials and the public all being asked to take action.\nThere are huge implications for domestic and foreign policy throughout Western countries.\nIt is hoped that knowing more about the attacks and the people who carried them out will help us all have a more informed debate about what action is needed.\nAbout this piece\nThis analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.\nAn earlier version of this piece was published on 14 June 2017. This version provides updated figures, based on the attacks that have subsequently taken place.\nEdited by Duncan Walker",

        "source_text": "Many Papuans saw the Dutch departure as a chance for complete independence. But within a year, forces from Jakarta had annexed the region and claimed it as part of Indonesia.\nA low-level guerrilla organisation called the Free Papua Movement has been fighting a secessionist battle ever since.\nDespite a heavy Indonesian military presence, attacks and skirmishes have occurred throughout the last four decades, killing thousands of Papuans.\nThe situation has been exacerbated by tensions within the Papuan community.\nLocals - who are mainly Christians or Animists of Melanesian origin - have clashed with Muslims who moved to the region as part of the government's transmigration programme.\nThe Dutch colonised Papua in 1828, but unlike the rest of Indonesia, they did not relinquish control of the province until the 1960s.\nInstead, on 1 December 1961, they agreed to grant Papuan self-rule.\nWhen the Dutch left, they handed Papua over to the United Nations and then to Jakarta, in a transfer agreement which stipulated that Papuans would be able to decide within six years whether to accept incorporation into Indonesia.\nThis opportunity came and went - and many Papuans, as well as human rights groups, have questioned why the region has still not been allowed a vote for independence.\nFrom the time Jakarta first annexed the province, there have been sporadic clashes between independence supporters and security forces.\nWhen President Suharto left office in 1998, advocates of Papuan separatism renewed their call for independence.\nAbdurrahman Wahid came to power in October 1999 and attempted to defuse the situation by publicly announcing that the government should accept the blame for some of the region's difficulties.\nBut Papuans still had many grievances against Jakarta. A major complaint was that much of the revenue from the region's extensive mineral and oil resources was going to central government coffers, rather than benefiting local people.\nIn 2001 Jakarta tried again to appease the Papuans, by granting them greater powers to manage their own affairs.\nThe region was allowed to keep up to 80% of the profits from its sale of minerals and agricultural produce, and was also allowed to change its name from Irian Jaya to the locally-preferred name of Papua.\nBut the situation remained volatile and the concerns of local people festered.\nIn 2005, two prominent activists were jailed for raising the \"Morning Star\" independence flag. Rights groups have repeatedly accused the Indonesian military of abuses in Papua.\nIn June 2010 representatives of the Papuan assembly held a ceremony symbolically handing back the special autonomy granted in 2001 to the Indonesian government.\nTwo months later, a report by the International Crisis Group (ICG) urged Jakarta to expand Papuan political autonomy and affirmative action policies, and tackle the influx of migrants from the rest of Indonesia.\n\"Unless these three issues are tackled head on in face-to-face meetings, the impasse is unlikely to be broken and increased radicalisation is likely,\" the report said.",

        "source_text": "This year's awards were criticised after BAME artists were excluded from all but the international categories.\nLaura Mvula threatened to boycott the ceremony, while Stormzy branded the Brits \"embarrassing\" in his song One Take Freestyle.\nNow organisers have invited 718 potential new pundits to \"refresh\" the voting system following a major review.\nVoters from BAME backgrounds will make up 17% of the panel, up from 15% last year.\nThe gender balance has also been reviewed, after a review discovered that 70% of the voting academy was male.\nNext year's winners will be chosen by a panel that is 52% male and 48% female.\nHundreds of former voters will find they have been culled from the list, which includes about 1,200 artists, journalists and music industry insiders every year.\nGed Doherty, chairman of the Brits, said the changes meant the awards were now \"better equipped to reflect the diverse nature of Britain and British music\".\nHe told Radio 1's Newsbeat that Stormzy's comments were \"a wake up call\". He later met with the MC to discuss the awards process, which led directly to the overhaul.\n\"A lot of people think the Brits is a stitch-up between the major record companies who sit in a dark room and decide who are going to get the awards [but] it's over 1,000 people from all over the industry.\n\"Each year we change about 300 members to keep it fresh but this year we've decided to change over 700 people as a result of... everything that happened.\"\nHowever, Doherty said he had resisted the idea of introducing genre-specific categories to boost representation of hip-hop, grime or dance.\n\"Nobody wants to be doing something that could be seen as tokenistic in any way, shape or form,\" he told the BBC.\nThe Brits' push to reflect the diversity will be aided by the fact that some of 2016's best albums have been released by artists from ethnic minority backgrounds.\nKano, Michael Kiwanuka and Mvula are all likely to receive nominations, after being shortlisted for the Mercury Prize earlier this year. Skepta's self-released grime album Konnichiwa eventually won that prize, beating bookmakers' favourite David Bowie.\nStormzy is likely to be eligible for the Critics' Choice award, which recognises up-and-coming artists who will release their debut album in 2017.\nThe move was praised by King, founder of the Mobo awards, who said: \"I am delighted, congratulate and thank the BPI for responding to feedback and improving diversity on their Brit awards voting panel. This is a really positive move forward.\n\"I founded Mobo 21 years ago in order to raise awareness of the imbalance within the music industry, so applaud any move to create broader platforms and level the playing field so that more talent can shine through.\"\nMvula said she was \"happy\" that progress has been made, but added: \"This should have been happening a long time ago\".\n\"My longing is just for us to represent the UK as it truly is, and it is one of the most diverse musical palettes on the planet,\" she told Radio 1.\n\"I want to be excited about going to the Brits.

        "source_text": "His family was known for its piety and his tribe claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad.\nAs a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law.\nHis family nicknamed him \"the Believer\" because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards.\nBaghdadi pursued his religious interests at university. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively.\nUntil 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children.\nHe taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club.\nDuring Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood.\nBaghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism.\nWithin months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity).\nIn February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months.\nWhile in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners.\nAccording to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled.\nBaghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004.\nAfter his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\nImpressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam.\nZarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri.\nThat October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda.\nBecause of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks.\nHe was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi.\nBaghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq.\nAfter the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir.\nBaghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces.\nHoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front.\nBaghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.\nBut Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad.\nIn the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed \"Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant\" (Isis/Isil).\nWhen al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda.\nIsis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws.\nIts stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq.\nIn June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis \"Islamic State\".\nDays later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph.\nThe media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times.\nBut if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.\nWilliam McCants is the author of The ISIS Apocalypse: The History, Strategy, and Doomsday Vision of the Islamic State.

Along the way he has been both a constant and an agent of change - a guaranteed gold until the very end, a lonely long distance runner every kid and granny in the country knows; a draw big enough to have pubs show his finals on big screens, the face of an open, forward-facing nation in an fractured, introspective time.\nBritish crowds in this stadium and on sofas across the country have made that journey with him. Wonder at the start, an intimacy as it developed with his tactics and celebrations afterwards, a collective desire to see him finish in the perfect way.\nFarah's devastation that his last championship race ended with a first defeat since August 2011 was clear as he fell to the Stratford track. The deafening wave of noise that had chased him round the stadium throughout the preceding 12 and a half laps broke into a stunned silence.\nThe roars soon returned. First the British women's quartet stormed to a 4x100m relay silver that represented a perfect synergy of their burgeoning individual talents. Then GB's men went one better, putting together an impeccable combination of changeovers and legs to win the nation's first sprint relay gold at a World Championships.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn those moments you sensed a generational shift, a feeling intensified by the sight of Usain Bolt stricken halfway down the home straight, his own valediction ending in pain and defeat and very nearly a wheelchair before he limped away, lost in the bedlam.\nFarah and Bolt, old friends, partners in track hegemony over the past decade, had shared a hug on the access road deep under the main stand as the Briton left the arena after his 5,000m and the Jamaican arrived for his sprint relay final.\nJust as Bolt had been after his defeat by Justin Gatlin in the 100m final a week ago, Farah is left without the scripted happy ending. The two champions have discovered in the same few days that time catches up with even the fastest of men, although the Briton did win 10,000m gold on the opening day of these championships.\nIn a strange way Farah's defeat may eventually both bring a greater appreciation for all that has come before and tighten further the bond between him and his audience.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe problem with perfection is that you can begin to believe there might be nothing else. You can start to think that repetition means it might be easy. You lose the connection between your humble world and theirs.\nWhen flaws eventually show, when muscles that were pushed to their limits finally refuse to give back as they have before, you see the effort and the character that might previously have slipped by unnoticed.\nSo it was with Farah, who knew coming into the last 70 metres that Ethiopia's Muktar Edris could not be caught but threw everything he had into fighting past Paul Chelimo and Yomif Kejelcha for a silver that at the start of the night he would have considered failure.\nAs former Olympic and world decathlon champion Daley Thompson said, watching for BBC Sport, it was like watching a gunslinger die with his boots on. So too with Bolt, who has probably known all year that he should have waved farewell after Rio a year ago, but tried forcing his creaking, popping body to respond one final time.\nInnocence and wonder always seemed to come naturally to Farah, the na\u00efve immigrant kid who on his first day at Oriel Junior School in Hanworth had gone home with a black eye after trying the least appropriate of his three English phrases (\"Excuse me\", \"Where is the toilet?\" and \"Come on then\") on the playground bully.\nIn his school races at Feltham Community College he sometimes misunderstood the instructions, took wrong turns and had to double back. As a talented teenager carrying heavy hopes he would be surprised when told how greater success would come - drinking, partying, jumping off Kingston Bridge into the Thames for a dare.\nBut there was never a naivety in the way he raced as a matured champion, up against 14 other men in global 5,000m finals, posses from other nations ganging up to disrupt his tactics, all trying to mess with his rhythm, sitting in his eyeline or breathing down his neck, slipping an unseen elbow into his ribs or leaning a little shoulder in as pumping arms came together.\nGreat distance runners must have intuition and intelligence and the physical weapons to utilise them.\nThey must be aware of what is happening in front of them and behind them and on either side, to calculate what those 14 rivals might want to be doing, and to respond to every challenge thrown at them - a burst from the gun, a punishing jab-hook of laps alternated fast and slow, a wind up from way out, an explosive kick from the bell or final all-out kick down the home straight.\nNot all the innocence went with the appreciation of that. After the holy nights of London 2012 and Farah's crescendo to Super Saturday came the hangover: a series of allegations against Farah's coach Alberto Salazar and leaks from the Russian hackers Fancy Bears that made many wonder in a different way.\nUK Athletics's review found \"no evidence of any impropriety\" in Farah nor any reason to \"lack confidence\" in his training programme. Salazar is still being investigated by the US Anti-Doping Agency.\nSome of those around Farah changed too. An uncomplicated man who lived to run employed PR firm Freuds to help manage his image. His smile, always unaffected and never far away, was repurposed by his shoe sponsor Nike as the subject of an advertising campaign.\nAnd so some wondered and speculated, even as the majority wondered and marvelled.\nSaturday night in Stratford, summer evening sky up above all pale blue and purple clouds, stands down below packed with partisans and Union flags, spoke only of belief.\n\"Would you have been prouder to have done it for Somalia?\" a reporter had asked Farah in the aftermath of his 10,000m win in London five long summers ago. The obsessive Arsenal fan had been indignant. \"Not at all, mate. This is my country.\"\nAs he stepped off the track on Saturday, beaten at last, it still felt that way, both looking at the crowd and the man they had come to roar home. Innocence to some, a wonder to far more.",

Mr Ruto stood as the judge asked him to enter a plea to each of the charges.\nHe answered each of  the three counts of murder, persecution and forcible transfer of people in turn, \"not guilty, not guilty, not guilty\". Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda began by accusing Mr Ruto of resorting to violence when his efforts at the ballot box failed, of stoking the flames of ethnic tensions and issuing the order to attack.\nThe deputy president watched and listened, smiling occasionally and shaking his head.\nThis is a politically controversial trial with a complex legal history, says the BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague.\nMr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were on opposite sides during the 2007 election and are accused of orchestrating attacks on members of each other's ethnic groups.\nThey formed an alliance for elections in March, saying they were an example of reconciliation.\nAnalysts say the ICC prosecutions bolstered their campaign as they portrayed it as foreign interference in Kenya's domestic affairs.\nMr Ruto watched and smiled during proceedings and pleaded not guilty to each of the three counts of murder, persecution  and forcible transfer of people, our correspondent says.\nMr Ruto's defence lawyer, Karim Khan, accused the prosecution of building its case on \"a conspiracy of lies\".\n\"We say that there is a rotten underbelly of this case that the prosecutor has swallowed hook, line and sinker, indifferent to the truth, all too eager to latch on to any... story that somehow ticks the boxes that we have to tick [to support charges],\" Mr Khan said.\nQ&A: Kenyan leaders at The Hague\nProfile: Fatou Bensouda\nQ&A: International Criminal Court\nHe downplayed claims his client was driven by ethnic hatred, telling the judges that two of Mr Ruto's sisters of the Kalenjin ethnic group were married to members of the rival Kikuyu group.\nChief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Mr Ruto had planned violence over an 18-month period prior to the 2007 elections, exploiting existing tensions between his Kalenjin group and Mr Kenyatta's Kikuyu group.\nMr Ruto used his power to procure weapons, secure funds and co-ordinate the violence, Ms Bensouda said.\nA group of Kenyan MPs and other supporters welcomed Mr Ruto and his co-accused Joshua arap Sang as they arrived for the trial, AFP reports.\nHe is the head of a Kalenjin-language radio station and is accused of whipping up ethnic hatred.\nIn Kenya, many people are following the case closely and opinion is split with opposition supporters welcoming the trial and government supporters opposed to it, says the BBC's Caroline Karobia in the capital, Nairobi.\nSome 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 forced from their homes in weeks of violence after the disputed December 2007 election.\nMore than 40,000 people are estimated to be still living in camps, which Mr Kenyatta last week promised to close by 20 September.\nOn Sunday, he gave cheques worth more than $4,500 (\u00c2\u00a33,000) per family so they could move out of camps and rebuild their lives.\nEx-UN chief Kofi Annan said, in an article in The New York Times, that the trials were not an assault on Kenya's sovereignty but the \"first steps toward a sustainable peace that Kenyans want, deeply\".\nBy Gabriel GatehouseBBC News, Nairobi\nWilliam Ruto and Uhuru Kenyatta have been successful in linking their personal legal problems with the national interest, in the Kenyan public imagination.\nThere are plenty who agreed with the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, when he said in May that the ICC is \"hunting Africans\". The notion that the court has a racist, neo-colonialist agenda is gaining currency.\nBut there are others who remember how the Kenyan parliament failed repeatedly to pass legislation that would allow the suspects to be tried at home. Many believe that, even with a reformed judiciary, the Kenyan courts do not have the teeth to put an entrenched political elite on trial.\nThen there are the thousands of victims of the post-election violence, still living in camps some five years after they were chased from their homes. Many of these people see little connection between the proceedings at The Hague, and their own efforts to seek justice and redress.\nSurvivors' tales\n\"Making clear that no one is above the law is essential to combat decades of the use of violence for political ends by Kenya's political elite,\" he wrote.\nMr Annan brokered the peace deal that brought an end to the brutal killings.\nIt included an agreement that those responsible for the violence must be held to account.\nA commission was set up to investigate the violence and it recommended that if efforts to establish special tribunals in Kenya failed, the matter should be sent to The Hague.\nKenya repeatedly failed to set up such tribunals and so the ICC indicted those it said bore the greatest responsibility for the violence.\nThe ICC on Monday said the two trials would not clash, after Mr Kenyatta warned that the constitution prevented the two men from being abroad at the same time.\nThe president is due to go on trial in November. He also denies charges of fuelling violence.\nThe judges said the two cases could be heard alternately - in blocks of four weeks.\nOn Thursday, Kenya's parliament passed a motion calling for the country to withdraw from the ICC.\nThe court said the cases would continue, even if Kenya withdrew.\nIn May, the African Union (AU) accused the ICC of \"hunting\" Africans because of their race and urged it to drop the Kenyan cases.\nThe ICC says it pursues justice impartially and will not allow perpetrators of violence to go unpunished.\nThe court was set up in 2002 to deal with genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression.\nIt has been ratified by 122 countries, including 34 in Africa.",

The real economy is only going to gradually emerge over the next three to six months,\" Mr Buxton said.\nHouse prices are expected to fall across the UK in the next three months, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has found.\nThe new chancellor, Philip Hammond, has said the Brexit vote has \"rattled\" financial markets and that the UK economy will face challenges following the \"shock\" of the referendum outcome.\nMr Hammond was facing \"one of the most unusual economic environments I have known in my 30-year investment career\", Mr Buxton said.\nHe predicted the UK government would take steps such as cutting stamp duty on house purchases and fuel duty in the Autumn Statement to help compensate for the dramatic slide in the pound.\nSterling was trading as high as $1.50 on the day of the EU referendum, but collapsed to as low as $1.28 in the wake of the leave vote.\nThe currency is now worth just under $1.32, but several big banks predict the pound to fall to $1.25 or lower given the expectations of interest rate cuts and slowing economic growth.\nMr Buxton said some OMGI clients had asked for their money back, but one big foreign client had increased its investments on the belief that the slide in sterling and falling share prices meant there were bargains to be had.\nHowever, many Old Mutual clients were still \"slightly stunned\" by the Brexit vote and were reluctant to take any action, he said.\n\"That will fade over time, but it's how can we get out to people and say 'look, we do still think there are some amazing investment opportunities here',\" Mr Buxton said. \"Our mood here is we're glass half full people.\"",

The film was classified PG, as were the earlier two films in the franchise.\nIn 2013, the most complaints have been about the violence in 12A-rated Tom Cruise action movie Jack Reacher.\nIn 2012, the BBFC classified 850 films - the highest number since 1965. No film or video works were refused a classification.\nOther trends in 2012 included a 40% rise in the number of classifications of online-only material.\nBBFC director David Cooke said that while the internet downloads did not fall under BBFC's remit - but could be submitted voluntarily - it was \"becoming clearer that both politicians and the public want us to play a role\".\nThe BBFC also backed government plans to change the rules on videos that are exempt from classification - such as music videos, documentaries and extreme fighting videos.\n\"It's become apparent that some of those exemptions have enabled some very strong material,\" Mr Cooke said.",

        "source_text": "Coverage of Russian air strikes in Syria has been leading news bulletins on Russian state television. Reports spoke of jets targeting the Islamist al-Nusra Front as well as so-called Islamic State (IS).\nBut mostly Russian media simply calls the targets \"IS\" or \"terrorists\".\nThe wide Russian coverage contrasts markedly with the secrecy that Russia clamped on military operations in Soviet times, particularly during the costly war in Afghanistan.\nIn a major new departure, Russian TV showed video of the air strikes, filmed by drones. Similar US and Israeli footage from the Middle East has been shown widely before, but this is quite new for Russians.\nChannel One TV, a key source of news for most Russians, stressed that the Russian operation was based on Syrian intelligence and had been requested by Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.\nReports on the air strikes echoed a warning from President Vladimir Putin that Russian Islamists in IS posed a threat to Russia.\nChannel One showed Russian jets being maintained at night as crews prepared for sorties from a base near the government-held Mediterranean port of Latakia.\nAn air force spokesman there, Igor Klimov, said eight IS targets had been destroyed - command and communications posts, transport, fuel dumps and weapons stores. They included \"terrorist\" operational headquarters \"in the mountains\".\nBulletins on the state-run Vesti news channel said Su-24 jets bombed al-Nusra Front positions just north of Homs, and a few hours later Syrian government troops attacked the militants. \"More than 5,000 militants are dug in there,\" it said. Al-Nusra is allied to al-Qaeda.\n\"The extremists are using tunnels and other underground passages to shelter from air raids, but the Syrian army doesn't have the necessary intelligence capability to reveal the Islamists' fortifications and underground passages in good time,\" Vesti reported.\nThat means the Syrian air force often gets there too late to support the ground troops, according to Vesti. \"The Russian planes will be able to operate over Syria in a much more timely and accurate manner.\"\nRussian news reports also say the planes can carry out raids around the clock, whereas Syrian aircraft are limited to daytime raids.\nThe Russian defence ministry said the Russian jets carried out 20 raids on Wednesday, 12 of them against IS targets. It insisted that no civilian infrastructure was targeted.\nFour of the air raids against IS were conducted at night.\nIn all, Russia has deployed more than 50 planes and helicopters to Syria, the ministry says.\nRussian Su-24M jets completely destroyed an IS command post in Latamineh, as well as an IS headquarters and ammunition dump near Talbiseh, Gen Igor Konashenkov of the defence ministry said.\nHe said the air strikes also destroyed a \"terrorist\" headquarters and ammunition dump near the town of Idlib, a command post near Hama and an explosives factory north of Homs.\nMeduza, a liberal Russian-language news source based in Latvia, quoted the figure of 36 civilians killed in the Russian bombing, widely reported by Western media. The figure was given by Khaled Khoja of the anti-Assad Syrian opposition.\nPresident Putin rejected reports of civilian casualties as \"information warfare\" and the news outlets that most Russians rely on did not report Mr Khoja's allegation. Nor did they report Western claims that moderate Sunni rebels had also been bombed.\nThe Russian daily Kommersant appears to give the most details of the Russian operation, including precise figures for the aircraft involved and their combat radius in Syria.\nKommersant published a map (in Russian) listing the Russian air force deployment as: four Su-30 SMs, six Su-34s, 12 Su-24Ms, 12 Su-25 SMs.\nKommersant said an Islamist push towards the Latakia region in recent months had alarmed the Syrian government.\nRussian media stress that only professional soldiers have been sent to Syria, not conscripts. However, the force strength and units have not been revealed.\nAccording to the daily Vedomosti, there will be no shortage of soldiers willing to go there, to earn bonus pay. Officers were paid an extra $62 (??41) a day there, and lower ranks an extra $43 (??28), it reported, quoting Valentina Melnikova, head of the Soldiers' Mothers group.\nSince the rouble's slump in value, that kind of bonus - paid in roubles - means a lot more purchasing power in Russia.\nAn operation to oust IS from Palmyra would have great propaganda value, Kommersant suggests, but would be high-risk for Russia. Photos revealing IS destruction of Palmyra's ancient temples triggered international outrage.\nMeanwhile, in the popular tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets, military analyst Ruslan Pukhov warned that an attack on the Russian air base could not be ruled out - even by \"some unidentified planes\".\nFaced with that risk, he warned that limiting the operation to the air force \"cannot save us from a ground operation - and we need to be ready for that\".",

Prices range from \u00a342 for a hamster or guinea pig, up to \u00a3187 for a large dog.\nMeanwhile, it costs \u00a3900 to bury a horse (they are too big to be cremated at Penwith), or \u00a31,500 for a human being.\nMs Lally says: \"It was my silly idea to set up the business back in 1988.\"\nShe adds that she came up with the idea when she realised that there were many people like her and her husband who would like give their pets a formal cremation or burial. And that others would, like them, also consider being ultimately buried beside their pets, or where their beloved animals' ashes were scattered or interred.\n\"My husband and I were running a farm, and we were lucky enough to have the land to set up the business,\" says Ms Lally.\n\"So we set aside six acres. The business then gradually grew from there thanks to positive word of mouth and repeat business.\n\"Everyone who comes here goes away and happily recommends us to other people, and we get people who come back with their second and third pets.\"\nFar from being just a British phenomenon, the industry of pet cremation and burial, or \"pet loss\" as it is known, is now a very big business globally.\nAccording to US-based trade body Pet Loss Professionals Alliance (PLPA), the average annual turnover of its members around the world in 2013 was $860,464 (\u00a3556,000).\nAnd that year its members in the US alone cremated 1.46 million pets.\nColeen Ellis, co-chair of the PLPA, opened the first stand-alone pet funeral home in the US.\nToday, she owns and runs an organisation called Two Hearts Pet Loss, which educates veterinary professionals and pet loss businesses about how best to meet the needs of people whose pets nearing the end of their lives.\nBased in Indianapolis, Indiana, Ms Ellis, who is also the author of a book on the subject, says it is important to remember that there are two types people who have pets - \"pet owners\" and \"pet parents\".\nShe adds: \"My services are geared towards the pet parent, the person who saw their little furry animal as a member of the family.\n\"I wanted to give people 'permission' to do what they wanted to do to honour their pet, and to honour the life they shared together.\n\"We are giving them permission to do more, and possibly in an area where they may be felt like they were going to be shamed, or made fun of, because a lot of people may be looking at them and saying 'it was just a dog', or 'it was just a cat, why do you want to do that, that's crazy?'.\"\nVivianne Dhupa and her husband Sarit Dhupa decided to go into the pet loss industry after a traumatic experience following the death of their then 17-year-old cat in 2004.\nTheir cat died on route to their vets in San Diego, California, and the couple did not want to take its ashes back from the surgery.\nA few months later Ms Dhupa went back to ask where the ashes had been scattered, only to be told that the cat had been taken to an animal rendering plant, because the couple hadn't specifically requested cremation.\n\"Needless to say, I was angry and devastated,\" says the 42-year-old.\nTo prevent other pet owners going through a similar experience, the couple set up their own pet crematorium - Peaceful Paws Pet Crematorium. This now cremates 20,000 pets per year, and customers can choose from a range of specially designed pet urns.\nHowever, Ms Dhupa and her husband went one stage further, and also opened a hospice centre for dying pets, the Into The Sunset Pet Transition Centre.\nMs Dhupa says: \"While our primary goal is to ensure our patients are pain-free and maintaining an acceptable quality of life, we focus a great deal on supporting the family emotionally.\n\"We do not prolong life or hasten death. Our primary goal is quality of life until the family is ready for their final goodbye.\"\nBack in the UK, Carole Mundy, 61, has purchased burial plots at Penwith Pet Crematorium for her herself and her husband, and all of their cats and dogs. Plus three separate areas for her rescued horses. She says it has cost her thousands of pounds.\n\"I wanted to find a resting place where I can be buried with all of my animals,\" she says.\n\"They give me unconditional and devoted love, so why would I not want to be buried with them.\"\nDo you have a memorial to your pet?

Nobody has tried it before and lawyers disagree about what the Commission's conclusion would be.\n\"It wasn't the European Union that delayed for years the extradition of Abu Hamza, almost stopped the deportation of Abu Qatada, and tried to tell Parliament that - however we voted - we could not deprive prisoners of the vote.  It was the European Convention on Human Rights,\" she said.\nThe first thing to do is distinguish between two courts: the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\nThe ECHR, which was indeed involved in the Abu Qatada case and some (but not all) of the cases about prisoners being allowed to vote, is not part of the EU.\nIts job is to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights, which was drawn up after World War Two, partly thanks to Winston Churchill. The Convention is incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act (HRA).\nThe other court is the ECJ, which is an EU institution. Its job is to uphold EU law, including the right of free movement, and so it can rule on deportations.\nIt has also made rulings on prisoners' voting rights and may be involved if the UK tried to deport or bar entry to criminals who are from the EU or related to EU citizens, for example.\nIf the UK were to leave the EU, it would no longer be bound by rulings from the ECJ, but it would still be bound by the ECHR, unless it decided to leave that as well.\nBut could the country, as Theresa May suggests, leave the ECHR and abolish the Human Rights Act, but stay in the EU?\nThat's tricky. There's disagreement between lawyers as to whether adherence to the ECHR is a condition of EU membership, as this House of Commons Library research paper makes clear.\nThe European Commission has said that it uses being a signatory of the Convention as a way for countries to demonstrate that they have the respect for human rights required for membership.\n\"Any member state deciding to withdraw from the Convention and therefore no longer bound to comply with it or to respect its enforcement procedures could, in certain circumstances, raise concern as regards the effective protection of fundamental rights by its authorities,\"  the Commission said in 2007.\nUnder such circumstances, the Commission would have to decide whether whatever replacement the UK decided to enact in place of the Convention demonstrated sufficient respect for human rights to allow for continued membership.\nRead more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

You name it, I'd have heard it,\" he told The Times of India's Crest.\nHe then went on to list some of his favourite bands and songs.\n\"Queen - I Want To Break Free; Rod Stewart - Some Guys Have All The Luck; Chris de Burgh; George Michael; Duran Duran; Guns N' Roses; Metallica... I still remember we used to hear Hysteria in a loop...\n\"Pet Shop Boys, Michael Learns To Rock, Milli Vanilli, Bon Jovi... Always came later, I remember... and Bad Medicine... Bryan Adams, Richard Marx - you remember the slow number Wherever You Go? Then there were New Kids On The Block... I remember that song Baby I Believe In You...\"\nOn the campaign trail though, it was mostly romantic Bollywood music that played on his iPhone.\nThose close to him say that he is devoted to Dimple, his wife of 12 years, and a doting father to their three young children.\nThey say it was the defeat of Dimple in the 2009 by-election that spurred him to revive the party in the state.\nBut Mr Yadav's rise to prominence has been sudden. When I went to cover his election campaign at the end of January, he told me he had already covered 250 of the state's 403 constituencies.\nWhen the other parties were still thinking strategy, Akhilesh Yadav was traversing the length and breadth of this vast state, addressing rallies and connecting with the voters.\nBut until mid-February, when he suddenly became the new darling of the media, Mr Yadav and the Samajwadi Party had received little attention.\nParty boss Mulayam Singh Yadav was written off as old and ill, and his \"anti-English, anti-computer\" stance did not appeal to the young, aspirational population of the state, one of India's poorest.\nThe party had been criticised for patronising criminals during its previous stints in power.\nBut once Yadav junior became the visible face of the party, its prospects began to change.\nAt his rallies, he promised free laptops and tablets to students, free electricity to weavers and jobs to the unemployed in factories which he promised the party would set up if voted to power.\nHe also brought computers into the party office, promised to keep the \"goons\" out and promised strict punishment for anyone who indulged in any criminal acts.\nAlthough several of the Samajwadi Party candidates have criminal cases pending against them, his refusal to nominate DP Yadav, alleged to be a gangster, went down well with the voters.\nBut now questions are being raised about whether he is qualified to run a state with a complex web of caste and religious politics.\nAnalysts point out that he is a novice when it comes to administration and that it will not be easy for him to run the bureaucracy and at the same time work on developing the state.\nAlso, he will have to deal with dissent within his own party. In the run up to the polls, party leaders, including Yadav junior, had insisted that Mulayam Singh would be the chief minister.\nAnd even though Akhilesh had the backing of his father for the state's top job, the transition was far from smooth. It took all of the father's persuasive skills to convince senior party leaders to back the son.\nBut the biggest challenge for the new chief minister will be to rein in the party's youth cadre and its penchant for violence.\nMr Yadav has repeatedly said that \"whoever does anything wrong will not be spared - even if he is a member of the Samajwadi Party\".\nBut trouble has already begun - since the votes were counted on 6 March, there have been at least three serious instances of violence allegedly involving Samajwadi Party supporters.\nHow the new chief minister keeps them in check will decide the course of his government and whether it is re-elected.",

Are we not way above that?\"\nGood shot, Rand, but thwack came the response - \"I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there,\" said Trump.\nCue laughter. Next up into the ring was Wisconsin governor Scott Walker. \"Mr Trump. We don't need an apprentice in the White House.\" But with a squint of those blue eyes, Trump shot back \"in Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2bn right now. I would do so much better than that.\"\nJake Tapper, the excellent CNN host, didn't quite say \"roll up, roll up who else wants to take their chances against my boy?\" But he didn't need to. They were lining up.\nHold on a minute. What's this? My, my, a lady is getting into the ring. Surely she wouldn't be able to draw blood where everyone else had failed. Well she did.\nThe former Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina had been roundly insulted by Trump when he questioned her suitability because of her appearance.\nHe told Rolling Stone  - \"Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\"\nShe was stoic and measured: \"I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr Trump said.\" And Trump was now visibly back-pedalling. \"I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.\"\nHer face was acid. She did not flinch. It was a gotcha moment.\nAnd \"low energy\" Jeb Bush - as Donald Trump dubbed him -  achieved something similar when he gave a Trump a good kicking over the tycoon bringing Bush's Mexican-born wife into the political debate.\nTrump looked defensive. He wouldn't give the apology that Bush demanded, but he was discomfited.\nThere was a lot of serious stuff in this sprawling three hour debate. But if you're in a fairground - well you want all the fun of the fair. And once again Donald Trump provided it.  He is still the focal point. But he saw tonight that his opponents are prepared to fight back.\nAnd so the circus moves on. So roll up next time to see whether the polls change, whether all those candidates can stay the course.

The Conference North side were a division and 18 places below their Welsh opponents and were roared on by more than 3,000 supporters among the 14,585 Wembley crowd.\nThe Villagers, who lost the 1997 FA Vase final at the old Wembley, made a bright start, but Wrexham took the lead when Joe Clarke and Connor Jennings combined to set up Moult, who swept home from six yards.\nNorth Ferriby's forays into the Wrexham half were rare, but a breakaway from Danny Clarke forced Andy Coughlin to come off his line to make a save.\nJason St Juste, who opted to miss St Kitts and Nevis's 2018 World Cup qualifier against the Turks and Caicos Islands so he could feature at Wembley, caused problems for the Wrexham defence early in the second half and Coughlin had to save at the winger's feet before Blaine Hudson cleared the danger.\nJennings should have doubled Wrexham's lead after he rounded Nicklin but his shot was cleared off the line by Danny Hone before Harris returned from touchline injury treatment to oblige on 59 minutes.\nThe midfielder found himself unmarked on the right flank and hit a shot from the edge of the area that beat Nicklin at the near post.\nWith Wrexham in control North Ferriby were awarded a penalty with 15 minutes remaining.\nCoughlin was booked for upending Clarke and captain King struck his penalty high into the roof of the net to give his side a lifeline.\nThe goal gave Billy Heath's side confidence. With four minutes left, St Juste's cross from the left wing was met by Kendall to level the scores, and Coughlin then had to tip over Clarke's curling effort in the final moments just to keep Wrexham alive into extra time.\nNorth Ferriby started the additional period as they had finished the 90 minutes and the impressive St Juste's deflected cross found Kendall, whose downward header beat Coughlin to give North Ferriby the lead for the first time.\nSubstitute Andy Bishop was denied by Hone's perfectly timed tackle before Moult rescued Wrexham with a stunning strike two minutes from the end of extra time to take the game to penalties.\nWrexham manager Kevin Wilkin told BBC Radio Wales: \"I'm gutted. We had a great opportunity to put ourselves in the driving seat and to give the game away like we have, I feel we've left people down today.\n\"There were no issues, but then we started dropping off and getting deep again. We didn't defend crosses, we didn't get tight to people and gave them time and space. But credit to North Ferriby, they stuck to their work.\n\"I'm here to do a job.

Not only did he open the scoring with a volley, the team looked badly affected when he had to be replaced because of injury midway through the first half.\nDjoum's goal, just before half-time, allowed the home side to be more self-assured and he finished well inside the area from Smith's cross. On a rare foray forward, Nowak also hit a post late in the game with a curling effort.\nWalker came to prominence after the interval with a display of poise and quick-wittedness. He had already skewed one shot wide and had another effort blocked by Will Boyle before he scored his first goal.\nThat came through good instincts, since he was well-placed to pounce on the rebound when Kilmarnock goalkeeper Jamie Macdonald pushed away a long-range Prince Buaben shot.\nThe attacking midfielder scored his second goal when Boyle was short with a pass-back and Walker coolly slipped the ball past Macdonald. He received a standing ovation when he was replaced before the end.\nThe visitors were well beaten in the end although never eased up on their competitive nature. Individuals suffered difficult nights, though, with Kris Boyd's every touch booed by the home support after his recent public criticisms of Cathro.\nBoyd was unruffled by being targeted, although he was infuriated at times by his team-mates' failure to back up his pressing of the Hearts centre-backs.\nBoyle suffered an even more uncomfortable night. He was booked in the first half after fouling Johnsen and was fortunate not to be sent off just before the interval for a crude challenge on Buaben.\nEven when Kilmarnock did threaten, their most prolific player, Souleymane Coulibaly, could not find his range and he swept a Steven Smith cross over the bar.\nIt was a night to forget for the visitors and Gary Dicker was judged to have fouled Zanatta in the closing stages, but Macdonald managed to save the Canadian's spot kick.\nMatch ends, Heart of Midlothian 4, Kilmarnock 0.\nSecond Half ends, Heart of Midlothian 4, Kilmarnock 0.\nPenalty missed!

The pair were married within six months.\nBriers made his West End debut in Gilt and Gingerbread at the Duke of York's Theatre in 1959 and two years later he got his big break in TV after landing the lead role in Marriage Lines alongside Prunella Scales.\nHe went on to star in Brothers in Law, and appeared in several other popular television programmes, including the Morecambe & Wise Show and Dixon of Dock Green.\nIn 1975 Briers was cast in the lead role for new BBC sitcom The Good Life - the part that would make him a household name.\nThe part had been specifically written for him by the scriptwriters, John Esmonde and Bob Larbey.\nHis character, Tom Good, decided to give up his steady office job on his 40th birthday and become self-sufficient.\nHe and wife Barbara (Felicity Kendal) continued to live at their plush home in the Surrey commuter belt of Surbiton, but to the horror of  their well-heeled neighbours Margo and Jerry (Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington) they turned their garden into an allotment where they kept livestock, and started making their own clothes.\n\"I actually didn't think the series was going to be successful when I first read the script,\" he said last year. \"I worried that it was all a bit mundane and middle class.\n\"But the moment that my character, Tom Good, leaves his job as a draughtsman for a company that makes plastic toys for cereal packets and attempts to live off the land in Surbiton, he becomes much more interesting.\"\nThe series, which came ninth in a 2004 poll to find Britain's best loved sitcoms, was hugely successful, with the last episode filmed in front of the Queen in 1978.\nIt was often repeated over the years prompting Briers to quip that people still expected him to look the same 25 years on when in fact \"I'm an old git with white hair\".\nHis distinctive voice was heard in a number of productions.\nHe was the narrator on the popular 1970s children's TV series, Roobarb & Custard and was the voice of the rabbit Fiver in the animated film of Watership Down.\nHe was a frequent voice on radio where he played Dr Simon Sparrow in BBC Radio 4's adaptations of Richard Gordon's comic novels Doctor in the House and Doctor a Large.\nHe also made a number of appearances as Bertie Wooster in radio dramatisations of PG Wodehouse's Jeeves books.\nHe appeared in a number of commercials, including voicing the griffin in advertisements for Midland Bank, now part of HSBC.\nBriers went on to star as the obsessive Martin Bryce in Ever Decreasing Circles, again written for him by Esmonde and Larbey.\nIn 1987, hankering for more serious roles, he joined Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company where he took on a number of stage roles and appeared in Branagh's films of Henry V and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\nIn Frankenstein, he played alongside Robert De Niro, whose acting techniques were in stark contrast Briers' own, no-nonsense style.\n\"I'd learn the lines and say them, hopefully at the right time,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.\nBut in one scene, Briers' character had to call De Niro, playing Frankenstein's monster, into a room.\n\"I said, 'I know you are there, come in, come in' - but nothing happened.\n\"Branagh was behind me saying, 'don't be a fool, you've got to make him come in. He's not like you. You've got to make him feel he must come in.'\"\n\"I said, 'I've read the script. I say 'come in' and he comes in.\"\nIn 2000, he was catapulted back into the TV spotlight when he played Hector Macdonald, the ageing patriarch in Monarch of the Glen.\nIn recent years he had roles in Extras, New Tricks and Holby City and in 2012 he appeared in film comedy Cockneys and Zombies, where he was a resident in a home under threat from a zombie apocalypse.\nHe was appointed OBE in 1989 and CBE in 2003.\nAs he got older he seemed to relish his new persona as a grumpy old man, particularly when it came to comedy.\n\"They simply don't write funny stuff anymore,\" he once said.  \"A lot of it is very depressing. Or violent. Or both.\"\nEarlier this year, the actor revealed his struggle with the lung disease emphysema - caused, he said, by a 50-year smoking habit.\n\"I get very breathless, which is a pain in the backside,\" he told the Daily Mail.\n\"I haven't even got the strength to garden any more. Trying to get upstairs - oh God, it's ridiculous.\n\"The ciggies got me. I didn't think it would go quite as badly as it has. It's a bugger, but there it is. I used to love smoking.\"",

At one point, he wandered off into the crowd to inspect how others were doing, before returning to rejoin the session.\nThe live commentary informed the participants about the benefits of striking each pose - one, it said, helped with spondylitis, another eased back pain.\nMr Modi's impromptu yoga session was applauded by the other participants.\nSonia Tomar, who is training to be a policewoman, said she was \"stunned\" and \"thrilled\" when the prime minister \"sat down next to us to do yoga\".\nHours before the event began, the participants had taken their places on colourful mats on Rajpath.\nA group of girls said they had been asked to report to school at 21:00 India time [15:30GMT] on Saturday night and had stayed there till morning.\nJust after 4am, they were bussed to the sprawling lawns of India Gate for the event and not one of them said they were tired.\nThere were a lot of happy excited faces, some were laughing and chatting, some were practising their yoga moves.\n\"I have been doing yoga for the last six years,\" said 14-year-old Nikita Thakur. \"No-one had paid so much attention to yoga before.

Israel enforces the blockade, it says, to stop arms reaching Palestinian militants in the territory.\nMr Erdogan said earlier this week that normalised relations between Israel and Turkey would benefit the whole Middle East region.\nIsrael was quick to respond. \"Israel has always sought stable relations with Turkey and is constantly looking for ways of how to get there,\" Foreign Ministry Director-General Dore Gold said in a statement.\nNow Israel says the two sides have reached a preliminary agreement to restore relations after secret talks in Switzerland.\nSo is this the end of the long diplomatic hiatus between the two countries?\nMichael Herzog, a retired lieutenant general of the Israeli army and a former military advisor to the defence ministry, says Mr Erdogan's statements were duly noted by the Israeli government circles.\n\"There is a lot of interest to explore whether or not Israel can make peace with Turkey,\" he says.\nTurkey listed three preconditions for a possible normalisation of relations between the two countries.\nThe first of these was \"an apology\" from the Israeli government for the Mavi Marmara flotilla incident. This has already been met, as Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu apologised to Mr Erdogan for \"any errors that could have led to loss of life\" in March 2013.\nTurkey also wants compensation to be paid to the families of the victims of the raid. According to Israel media reports, Israel has agreed to pay the relatives $20m (\u00c2\u00a313.4m).\nThe last precondition is the lifting of the blockade on Gaza.\n\"It's surprising to see that Erdogan said the region needs normalised relations with Israel and then went back to state those preconditions stipulated five and a half years ago,\" says Dan Arbell from the Washington-based Brookings Institute.\n\"From Israel's point of view, the lifting of the Gaza blockade is not going to happen.\n\"If Erdogan insists on this issue, this process is not going to move forward,\" he adds.\nFollowing the Mavi Marmara raid, Turkey and Israel withdrew their ambassadors and ended their joint military exercises, although trade and tourism continued at about the same levels.\nThere have previously been talks of a return to normal relations, but many argue that recent regional and domestic changes may have improved the chances.\nAfter Turkey downed a Russian jet over Syria last month, Moscow shelved plans for the Turkish Stream natural gas pipeline project - designed to boost Russian gas exports to Turkey.\nTurkey already imports 56% of its natural gas from Russia and natural gas serves 32.5% of Turkey's overall energy consumption.\nNecdet Pamir, an expert on energy in Bilkent University in Ankara, says Israeli natural gas could be an alternative to Turkey's \"extreme dependency\" on Russian gas.\nHowever, he says it could take years for this alternative to become a reality.\n\"Israeli gas, Qatari gas or Iraqi gas cannot possibly meet Turkey's needs if Russia ends the gas flow in the short-term.\"\nExperts say there could be other factors at play.\n\"Erdogan's comments are most likely the result of Turkey's relative regional isolation following tension with Egyptian President [Abdul Fattah al-] Sisi and Syrian leader [Bashar al-] Assad as well as its recent crisis with Russia,\" says Israeli analyst Calev Ben Dor.\nMeanwhile, Ceyhun Cicekci from the Turkey-based think tank Orsam says the conflicts in Syria and Iraq and the rise of the so-called Islamic State could have pushed Israel and Turkey closer towards one another.\nA possible rapprochement between the two countries and the reactivation of the military cooperation could send a strong message to the Syria-Russia-Iran axis, he says.",

From its design to its destination, this attack underlines that IS has found a new way to inflict harm and cause terror.\n\"Daesh used, for the first time, a new tactic which helped it to move undetected through checkpoints,\" a Western security source in Baghdad tells me, using the name for IS more commonly used in the region.\n\"We've never seen it before, and it's very worrying.\"\nPrecise details of the attack, which is under Iraqi investigation, are still being pieced together.\nThe tactic known as a VBIED - vehicle-borne improvised explosive device - is now widely used in suicide bombings.\nBut this one is said to differ in the way the explosives were placed in the van, and how the chemicals were put together.\n\"It's really difficult to make,\" an explosives expert who has knowledge of the investigation explained, saying the device may have been developed in the Iraqi city of Falluja when it was under IS control.\n\"Daesh has given a lot of thought to how to move through checkpoints.\"\nThe bomb-makers are believed to have taken a formula \"available on the internet\", and then adjusted the quantities to reduce its risk of detection, and increase its impact.\nSeveral Iraqi experts also described the mix of chemicals as \"unique\".\n\"We are used to big fires but the chemicals in this bomb were used for the first time in Iraq,\" says Brigadier General Kadhim Bashir Saleh of the Civil Defense Force.\n\"It was unique, strange, and terrible.\"\nAnother Iraqi security expert, Hisham al-Hashimi, told me he believes a similar mix of explosives may have been used, only once, in an attack by al-Qaeda in 2004.\nBut he describes this new tactic deployed by IS as \"very serious and dangerous\".\nThe van exploded on the narrow street just after midnight shortly before Eid Festival when shops were packed with families, football fans were glued to big screens, and the billiard hall was doing brisk business.\nSeveral say the heat created by the first blast was \"as hot as the surface of the sun\".\nThe explosion left no gaping crater, and its impact did not wreck the nearest buildings.\nBut it set off secondary fires which turned out to be the most deadly of all.\nTheir devastating impact was then multiplied by a series of safety failures.\n\"There were no fire escapes,\" laments Sadiq Maroof, a shopkeeper who was one of a small number of people who escaped alive.\nHe takes me through the skeletal remains of the Laith Centre, from the blackened basement where he once ran two popular clothing shops, to the second floor room where he fled for his life.\n\"The stairs behind me were on fire so we pulled a window out of its frame and jumped.\"\n\"There had been two escapes,\" he says, still visibly angry and upset. This tragedy took the lives of nine people from his own family and many close friends.\n\"The first floor exit had been turned into a shop and the second floor escape became a storage room.\"\nSeveral experts estimated the initial bomb would have killed 20-30 people. The ensuing inferno then trapped many inside.\n\"The absence of fire escapes and safety regulations caused the highest number of casualties,\" says retired Brigadier General Khalaf Abdul Karim who was at the scene that night.\n\"We could hear people trapped inside desperately calling their family and friends for help. In those minutes some could have been saved.\"\nThe fire tore through shops with cheap styrofoam walls and bad wiring, with perfumes and other goods fuelling the flames.\nEach time we went to the street, grieving relatives approached us with harsh words for their emergency services, accusing them of arriving too late, and of not doing enough.\nWhen I ask Chief Sergeant Habib Dewan about the accusations, he immediately bursts into tears.\n\"We normally reach the scene in 4-5 minutes but we reached it in 8- 10 minutes,\" the fireman says.\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" he says of the blazing orange fireball which engulfed the entire street.\n\"We were ready to jump into the fire to save people. We did everything we could but this was an over-whelming attack.\"\nThere are many Iraqi stories about how a van was able to enter a street only used for pedestrian traffic.\nSome versions speak of a driver carrying official badges, others of the complicity of the security guards at the nearest checkpoints.\nBut this biggest single attack on civilians since the Iraq war of 2003 has finally focused official attention on the widespread use of detector \"wands\" which were proven long ago to be fake.\nIn the wake of this bombing, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi finally ordered their removal from checkpoints.\n\"Well - trained sniffer dogs are what's needed to stop these devices \" says one explosives expert in Baghdad.\nSecurity experts say even IS may not have expected to inflict such a high number of casualties in their Karrada bombing. \"They got lucky,\" is how one put it.\nBut life was pulled out of a Baghdad neighbourhood which still mourns its great loss.",

Mr Macron's close ally Richard Ferrand stepped down on Monday, amid unrelated allegations he had used insider information to secure a lucrative property deal for his wife while he was head of a mutual health insurance fund.\nMr Ferrand and Ms Goulard have both denied any wrongdoing.\nHowever, the allegations have cast a shadow over the new government. It was Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou who outlined details of a bill to clean up politics.\nThree of the figures brought in to replace the four who resigned were women from civil society rather than politics:\nThe relationship between the outspoken Francois Bayrou and Mr Macron's government has been tense for weeks.\nThe French papers were full of anonymous sources from the president's party denouncing Mr Bayrou as having an \"outsized ego\" who \"stops [them] from governing\". \"We can't keep moving forward,\" one said, \"when we're always going back every five minutes to check whether Bayrou has made a mess again.\"\nMr Bayrou's departure shows how difficult it can be to prevent scandal, even in those with a well-known political past.

It's getting more expensive to dispose of waste, provide social care to an ageing population and employ staff even if they're only getting a 1% pay rise.\nIt means that savings of considerably more than 1.8% in some services will be needed.\nLocal Government Minister Mr Hopkins told MPs the settlement still left councillors with \"considerable total spending power\" and many councils were seeing growth in income from business rates. He said the actual drop in spending power was 1.6%, when other grants were taken into account.\nHe said, with an \"unprecedented challenge to public finance\" the government had \"delivered a settlement that is fair for all parts of the country, whether North or South, urban or rural\".\n\"Councils facing the highest demand for services continue to substantially receive more funding and we continue to ensure that no council will face a loss of more than 6.4% in spending power in 2015-16, the lowest level in this Parliament.\"\nThe minister told MPs that all councils had achieved a balanced budget in 2014-15, and, he said, the \"majority of residents remain satisfied with the way their council has run things\".\nAnd he urged councils to use \"freeze funding\" provided by the government to keep council tax down. Councils which choose to increase their council tax by more than 2% will continue to have to hold a local referendum on the issue, he said.\nBirmingham - the largest local authority in the UK - is facing cuts next year of \u00c2\u00a3117m and similar savings each year until 2018.\nLabour's Hilary Benn said councils resented the government suggesting cuts were \"modest\". He said that councils serving the poorest areas had seen the largest reduction in funding \"relative to spending\".\nHe said that the city of Liverpool, by 2017, would have lost more than half of its government grant - compared with 2010.\n\"Councils are showing clear signs of financial stress,\" he said, asking what contingency plans were in place \"to deal with the failure of local councils\".\n\"There is no justification for taking most from those who have least.\"\nHe asked how many children's centres would have to close, what the effect would be on women's refuges and day centres for the elderly.\nThe provisional settlement announced by Mr Hopkins will need the approval of Parliament.\nMark Easton, BBC Home Editor\nBack in 1963, the earliest year for which I have found figures, local councils employed about two million people, 200,000 more than Whitehall. Ten years later, and the local authority workforce was close to three million and almost 900,000 greater than central government.\nToday, though, the situation has almost completely reversed, with half a million more people on the national payroll than the local one. Indeed, the number employed by local authorities has fallen more than half a million since the last election.\nIn many towns and cities, the council was once the biggest employer by far. Nowadays, that's much less likely to be true and may be changing the relationship between local people and the local authority. Councils have become more of a service commissioner than the heartbeat of the local economy.\nRead more from Mark\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) estimates that by 2016, government funding for local government will have dropped in real terms by 37% since 2010.\nGraeme McDonald, director of the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers said: \"This settlement reminds us that the financial challenge facing local government is immense. Cuts of up to 6.4% will push some authorities to breaking point.\n\"Government is beginning to recognise that councils have led the way on deficit reduction, but with cuts and demand increasing, fragility is beginning to show. The financial future of local services is unsustainable without a more ambitious plan for public service reform.\"\nCouncils are legally required to provide some services, such as adult social care, meaning most of the cuts have fallen in other areas, including leisure and culture.\nLast month the NAO said some authorities were showing \"clear signs of financial stress\", but many had \"coped well\" with cuts, adding that there were \"significant differences\" in the size of budget cuts faced by different council areas, with those that depend most on government grants the hardest hit.\nEarlier this month, Scottish local authorities were told they would get funding of almost \u00c2\u00a310.85bn in return for freezing council tax for the eighth year in a row, but Labour warned that people on lower incomes were the \"hardest hit\" by funding cuts.\nCouncils in Wales have been told they will get \u00c2\u00a3146m less in 2015-16 from the Welsh government, an overall cut of 3.4% on this year.",

Yes we do.\"\nHe told the programme: \"I think we need to think about legislation, we need to think about guidance, we need to think about the roles of schools, what is the role of parents and carers, enabling children and young people to empower themselves so that they can take some responsibility for their own safety.\nYsgol y Cymer in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf, is one school taking a pro-active approach to try to stop its pupils becoming victims of cyberbullying.\nUnder a scheme called Cymer Ofal, pupils are able to give advice to other younger pupils on Bullying and cyber-bullying.\nOne counsellor, Lowri Mitchinson, 16, who was bullied on ask.fm, said her experience could be used to help others.\n\"Some people don't see teachers as real people who actually care for you.

It wasn't a good idea to start believing stuff like that.\"\nThe bullying ended after two months but she said anyone suffering like she did should delete their accounts on the site.\nWhen asked to respond to the points raised in the Taro 9 programme, ask.fm said in a statement: \"We are committed to doing everything we can to protect our users.\n\"We are working with the pre-eminent online child safety expert Annie Mullins OBE to review and update our safety and privacy policies.\n\"This will ensure that our abuse and inappropriate content reporting systems are among the most effective in the industry.\"\nThe site is also asking users to report any bullying, insisting that complaints will be \"dealt with immediately\".\nA recent survey of nearly 1,000 children and young people in Wales by the Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales: Funky Dragon - an umbrella organisation promoting the rights of young people - appeared to show the scale of cyberbullying.\nWe're talking about online bullying and that's a situation where a person and in some instances a group of people use emails, the internet or any kind of digital technology to bully someone.\nIt could involve teasing, upsetting or humiliating and the thing is with this sort of bullying it's there 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nThere was a time when you could say bullying ended at the school gate but that's not the case any more.\nThe other thing about online bullying is that you don't always know who's responsible because it can be done anonymously and there are examples of people setting up fake accounts and hiding their IP address or even blocking their mobile number.\nParents need to be aware of what their children are doing online, understand what they're doing and make sure their children are happy to talk to them if there's a problem with bullying.\nSome 47% said they had been bullied and 37% of those said that they had suffered from cyberbullying.\nIt also suggested it was more of a problem among girls, with 43.8% reporting it compared with 27.4% of boys.\nResponding to the call for legislation, the Welsh government said developing positive and respectful relationships would be a better approach.\n\"We have published Respecting Others, a suite of comprehensive anti-bullying guidance which includes a specific section on cyberbullying,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"The guidance gives details of schools' legal responsibilities while providing them with information they need to create effective strategies for tackling bullying.\n\"There are already a number of criminal laws that can apply in terms of harassment or threatening behaviour, including threatening and menacing communications.\n\"Rather than criminalise bullying the focus should be on developing positive and respectful relationships amongst children and young people.\"\nTaro 9 is broadcast at 21:30 BST on S4C on Tuesday with English subtitles.",

The government has yet to comment.\n\"When I was working in news and current affairs in the '90s, the independence of the BBC was protected by a set of quiet customs and traditions,\" he said.\n\"Back then it was Willie Whitelaw who'd provided us with the certainty of a 15-year Charter, underpinning our independence by allowing us stability through the political cycle.\n\"When I returned to the BBC as director general, I was struck by a major change. The foundations of the BBC's independence had become weaker. The traditions and informal arrangements which protected it had been eroded.\"\nHe cited the decision to fund government programmes such as digital switchover, rural broadband and local TV as examples of how the licence fee should not have been used.\nHe also suggested recent licence fee settlements have been decided behind closed doors without a \"full process\".\nFuture licence fee negotiations should, he said, be made with the input of licence fee payers possibly by an online vote.\nThe speech to the Cardiff Business Club comes in the midst of negotiations for the corporation's next 10-year charter.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport is reviewing the size and scope of the BBC and what sort of programming the corporation should provide. One key part of the process is deciding who should oversee and regulate the corporation.\nThe current system, a BBC Trust, is both a watchdog and also the decision-making body controlling the size and strategy of the corporation.\nLord Hall, echoing the current BBC chairman, Rona Fairhead, said the roles should be split and the BBC should for the first time have an external regulator.\nHe also said the new BBC Charter should not say what programmes the BBC should be allowed to make nor should they be told to back away from output or ventures deemed to be too promising or popular.\n\"If, having cut our money, the charter also cuts our creative freedom to reinvent our services, or our commercial freedom to make up the shortfall... Letting this happen would not just have unintended consequences for the BBC, but for the UK's creative economy as a whole.\n\"Some might think, for example, that a call for us to focus only on content sounds reasonable. But 10 years ago that kind of prescriptive regulation would have prevented the BBC from investing in Freeview or creating the iPlayer. And it would have meant none of the ripple effects of that investment, which helped to create a new market for video-on-demand and benefit all players.\"\nAnd he added that the suggestion, made by some, that the BBC should renew its charter every five years would be a \"sword of Damocles\" in which the BBC's existence could be threatened at every election.\nInstead, he called for the charter period to be extended to 11 years, which would take it out of the electoral cycle and that any changes to the system should only be changed in Parliament with a two thirds majority and a vote by licence fee payers.",

        "source_text": "That is the big question hanging over the WTO as trade ministers from its member countries gather in Nairobi.\nThey are heading to the Kenyan capital for the WTO's tenth ministerial conference.\nThe organisation is increasingly at risk of being side-lined as groups of countries do trade and investment deals outside it.\nThe WTO was established in 1995 to be the main forum for trade rules and for negotiating the removal of barriers to international commerce.\nIt is conducting a wide-ranging set of negotiations intended to take this process further. It is called the Doha Round, and it was launched in the Qatari capital 14 years ago.\nIt is still limping along despite the original target for completing the talks being the beginning of 2005.\nSo far all it really has to show is an agreement on improving customs procedures, known as the Trade Facilitation Agreement.\nThe wider negotiations - to reduce tariffs (taxes on imports), farm subsidies and remove many other trade barriers - have failed to produce results.\nMany countries have turned their attention to negotiating in smaller groups. The prime examples are the United States' negotiations with Pacific nations and with the European Union.\nIt's very unlikely that the Nairobi conference will pronounce it dead. Some countries, including India, Indonesia and Venezuela want a formal reaffirmation of the declaration issued back in Doha.\nOthers, notably the US and European Union do not. They think it has become clear that this huge exercise - known in WTO-speak as a \"single undertaking\" - will fail to deliver results.\nSo it is certainly possible that the Nairobi Conference will mark an important moment in the failure of the Doha Round.\nHowever, there are areas where there could be some agreement.\nOne is the final agreement among a group of countries on tariff-free trade in a range of technology goods. This would extend an existing deal to a number of additional goods including new-generation semi-conductors, GPS navigation systems, some medical devices and touch screens.\nThere is also the possibility of a deal to improve export opportunities for the poorest nations, the least developed countries. This is about extending the scope for them to sell their goods without quota restrictions or tariffs.\nThere are signs that the WTO's members do seem to be willing to agree in these areas, but even so there is no guarantee they will.\nIt is possible that there will be no formal ministerial declaration at the end.  That would be the first such failure since the Seattle Conference in 1999, which ended with acrimonious disagreement between governments and was accompanied by often violent protests in the city's streets.\nThe WTO and its conference have in the past been a major focus for protests from groups which argue that globalisation has been a business-driven process undermining national sovereignty, environmental protection and labour standards.\nMore recently some of the trade negotiations outside the WTO have become more of a focus for some of these concerns.\nThose other talks have, after all, made more progress.  And there is a real possibility that the gap between the WTO's stumbling global agenda and the push towards smaller deals will be wider by the end of the Nairobi conference.",

It also survived both the water and sand tests but its owner was not keen on experimenting with the height drop.\nThe rugged phone market is forecast to account for around 18 million handset sales from a global predicted overall figure of 1.5 billion in 2016, phone analyst Ben Wood told the BBC.\n\"It's the long tail of the smartphone market, there are so many little niche opportunities that exist and that's where these guys are playing,\" he said.\nBut why not just buy a durable case for an existing handset?\nA rugged phone provides the convenience of an \"all-in-one\" solution, Mr Wood said, but they have another key advantage - because they are chunkier, heavier devices, they tend to be fitted with bigger, longer-lasting batteries.\n\"People want a good sustainable battery and most people when they're using a smartphone today find they struggle to get through the day,\" he said.\nAnother alternative is to buy a cheap but basic handset - although smartphone functionality is becoming more essential for people in the industry, Mr Wood added.\n\"People in construction want to have access to email, a good camera, they need to look at plans,\" he said. \"They need a smarter phone, a bigger screen.\"\nHowever no phone is invincible, he added.\n\"Different types of glass, different types of materials, different designs will offer you  a certain amount of rugged capability but make no mistake, any device will break if you really want to break it,\" he said.",

But within weeks the solidarity had disappeared and the divisions remain to this day.\nThe political camp that suffered most losses in the disaster is now the country's main opposition party - conservative Law and Justice (PiS), led by Lech Kaczynski's identical twin brother Jaroslaw. It has boycotted the official commemoration for the last four years.\nThe terrible tragedy has been abused as a political tool. So far all official investigations have concluded the crash was mainly caused by poorly trained pilots attempting to land in dense fog at Smolensk military airfield. They have ruled out sinister plots.\nThis week's revelations have added weight to what many suspected - that the pilots felt pressure to make the landing attempt, in order to be on time for the Katyn massacre commemoration.\nHowever, Mr Kaczynski's camp has encouraged people to believe it was not an accident, but an assassination concocted by the Russians and Lech Kaczynski's political foes. One in five Poles agree with him, according to a survey this week conducted for the daily Gazeta Wyborcza.\nThe official ceremony took place at the Powazki military cemetery, where President Bronislaw Komorowski laid a wreath at a memorial plaque.\nBut a large crowd held Polish flags aloft outside the presidential palace in Warsaw, where the Law and Justice (PiS) party - previously led by Lech Kaczynski - held its own commemoration ceremony.\nAccording to the leaked transcript, Polish air force commander-in-chief Andrzej Blasik was in the cockpit and told the pilots just before the crash: \"You'll make it easily\".\nThe transcript suggests that the pilots were distracted by people in or around the cockpit in the crucial minutes when they were deciding whether or not to land.\nRMF FM radio said Polish investigators had used new techniques to decipher parts of the cockpit voice recording, provided by the Russian authorities. The poor quality of the recording has hampered the investigation.",

It is promising,\" said the former Everton and Chelsea striker.\nOptimism has been high at West Ham after a productive summer for manager Slaven Bilic - but some of that may have disappeared after they were easily brushed aside at Old Trafford.\nBilic said afterwards it was hard to find any positives, but one poor performance on the opening weekend does not mean the Hammers should necessarily panic, especially as several key players - including Manuel Lanzini, Andy Carroll and Michail Antonio - were missing through injury.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Hammers' transfer policy over the summer has been clear: experienced internationals who have proven Premier League quality.\nThat arrived in the shape of Manchester City title-winning duo Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta, Stoke attacking midfielder Marko Arnautovic and former Manchester United striker Hernandez.\nRight-back Zabaleta probably came out with the most credit after a typically industrious display.\nBut questions may be asked over the ease with which England keeper Hart allowed Pogba's strike to creep in, while Hernandez barely had a sniff of a chance against his former club.\nThe Hammers only had one serious chance in a limp first-half performance - Edimilson Fernandes's fierce shot parried by David De Gea in the final kick before half-time - before Arnautovic's half-chance after the break.\nManchester United will look to follow up this fine opening win when they go to Swansea on Saturday (12:30 BST).\nWest Ham face another away game - because their London Stadium has been hosting the World Athletics Championships - as they visit Southampton on the same day (15:00).\nMatch ends, Manchester United 4, West Ham United 0.\nSecond Half ends, Manchester United 4, West Ham United 0.\nAttempt missed.

Unemployment was high, especially among the young, and among Britain's black and Asian population.\nThere was also considerable tension between police and some communities. There had been fierce riots in Brixton, south London, that month lasting several days.\nTV news had shown police officers in their everyday helmets and uniforms, cowering behind flimsy-looking riot shields as bricks and bottles were hurled at them.\nThat happened again, as riots broke out in Toxteth, Liverpool, on 3 July, before erupting in other English cities.\nLike last summer, police struggled to keep control of the streets and mass media were blamed for encouraging copy-cat rioting. But in 1981 the disorder took place mostly in the deprived inner city, rather than spreading to the suburbs.\nThe file gives an unusually detailed picture of how Mrs Thatcher responded, according to Lord Hennessy. He describes it as \"almost blow by blow, minute by minute\".\nFor instance, on 11 July, in the morning, she talked to her Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw.\nHe had just visited Manchester and Liverpool and reported that there was now \"widespread anxiety\" about civil unrest in London, and properties were being boarded up across the city.\nThere had been reports of disorder in many parts of the capital. Just the night before, according to the file, there had been rioting in Brixton, Battersea, Clapham, Streatham, Hackney and Acton.\nCars had been burned in Southall, and petrol bombs thrown in Dalston. Stoke Newington police station had been attacked.\nMrs Thatcher and Mr Whitelaw discussed how to get better equipment for the police, and briefly touched on the idea of sending in troops - something a Liverpool MP had called for.\nThey agreed that using the Army \"could not be contemplated\". They would prefer to arm the police, the record notes.\nThat very evening Mrs Thatcher visited the Metropolitan Police and spent more than seven hours with the commissioner, only leaving New Scotland Yard at three in the morning.\nThe police had appealed for a new Riot Act and they had also given her a shopping list of riot gear - shields, protective clothing, water cannon, CS gas, rubber bullets and surveillance helicopters.\nNew tactics, new equipment, \"saturating\" the cities with police, ended the riots.\n\"An age of innocence\" had ended, according to Lord Hennessy. \"People thought riots couldn't happen here - but they did.\"\nThe police got their equipment but they didn't get the new law immediately - it was only in 1986 that a new Public Order Act was passed.\nIs there any lesson for today's politicians?\nLord Hennessy says while there is a great danger of excessive prime ministerial power in this country, in such circumstances \"the prime minister has to speak out, to take a lead\" as Mrs Thatcher did.",

Migrants with no grounds for EU asylum are being returned to Turkey, which has been promised extra EU aid and visa-free travel in exchange.\nDespite that drop, the numbers reaching Italy on the central Mediterranean route have remained similar to last year's pattern, with more boats leaving Libya in the good weather.\nOn that route the main countries of origin are: Nigeria (15%), Gambia (10%), Somalia (9%), Ivory Coast, Eritrea and Guinea (8% each) and Senegal (7%), the UN refugee agency UNHCR reports.\nWhy is EU struggling with migrants and asylum?\nEritrean migrants face new asylum battle\nAt a Malta summit in November, the European Commission, which drafts EU laws, agreed to put \u20ac1.8bn into an Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.\nThe aim is to combat people-trafficking gangs and reduce the incentives for sub-Saharan Africans to make the hazardous journey to Europe. That includes creating jobs and tackling extreme poverty in their home countries.\nCurrently no more than 40% of failed asylum seekers are accepted back by their home countries, so the EU also wants to boost those numbers. Countries that fail to co-operate could face cuts in the EU aid they receive.\nMr Avramopoulos said \u20ac8bn of EU budget funds could go into the migration partnership in 2016-2020. But in the long term the commission believes it can attract bigger sums in private investment.\nThe migration pressure from Africa is expected to keep growing in coming years.\nEU partnership programmes specially tailored to each country's conditions are being developed for nine countries initially: Ethiopia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia. The plan is to expand such aid later to more countries.\nThe EU package will include provision of border surveillance equipment, police training and other technical support to stop migrants heading north.\nThat is especially controversial in the Horn of Africa, where the commission has already mapped out \u20ac40m worth of projects as part of the Emergency Trust Fund.\nEritrea and Sudan are subject to international sanctions because of alleged large-scale human rights abuses, which both governments deny.\nThere is concern that Kenya's decision to close the world's biggest refugee camp - Dadaab - could boost the numbers heading to Europe from the Horn. Dadaab houses about 350,000 people, mostly from war-torn Somalia.\nOn Monday EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said \"we too often forget that countries like Ethiopia or Kenya, let alone Lebanon and Jordan, host huge numbers of refugees. The closure of the Dadaab camp in Kenya could have dramatic humanitarian consequences\".\nMr Avramopoulos said the commission would also relaunch the Blue Card scheme - a way for the EU to attract skilled professionals from non-EU countries.\nLaunched in 2012, the scheme has made little progress - in 2014 only 13,852 Blue Card work permits were issued, about 12,000 of them provided by Germany.\nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

At the same time, just in case if it happens, I will not even let such people near me.\"\nThe political uncertainty in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has given new meaning to Rajinikanth's remarks and has led to heated televised debates.\nThe state plunged into crisis after the death of chief minister J Jayalalitha in December. It eventually led to a split in her ruling AIADMK party. The opposition party DMK is now led by an ageing leader who is enfeebled.\nPolitical watchers say the Hindu nationalist BJP - which rules at the centre - is biding time to enter Tamil Nadu, a state that has so far resisted it. And many believe the party has been wooing the superstar to make political inroads into a state, which sends 39 MPs to the parliament.\n\"There is a political vacuum in Tamil Nadu that can be filled by the BJP. Rajinikanth is the right person for the right party,\" Narayan Thirupathy, BJP spokesperson in the state, told reporters.\nIn the past, the star has dropped hints about joining politics, but eventually stayed away.\nMany say Rajinikanth's rhetoric sounds similar to the growling threats the star routinely delivers to the villains in his hit movies.\nThey believe he has not done anything concrete in the past two decades apart from making \"vague\" statements about his political ambition.\nCritics say his statements on important matters for the Tamil people - like the Cauvery river water dispute or the more recent support to a controversial bull-taming festival - have never gone deep into the issues beyond platitudes.\nRajinikanth was born into a Marathi family in the southern state of Karnataka and worked as a bus conductor before the movie bug bit him and led him to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu.\nMarried into an upper-caste Tamil family, he says he's a \"pure Tamil\" whose heart beats for the Tamils who have welcomed him and given him \"fame, fortune and love\".\nRajinikanth has made regular statements about participating in politics since his famous public appeal during the 1996 elections.\nIn a televised appeal then, he had urged the people not to vote for the AIADMK party since Ms Jayalalitha was facing criminal charges for economic offences, and urged people to support the DMK.\nPolitical watchers said his appeal swung the elections, leading to the AIADMK's defeat in the polls.\nDuring the 2004 elections, he supported an alliance of the AIADMK and BJP.

At last count, there were 55,000 such clubs in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere.\nTo keep alive his larger-than-life image among his fans, Rajinikanth's script writers add to the speculative frenzy by adding dialogue loaded with political meanings in his movies.\nHis portrayal as a righteous spokesperson for the underdog in all his movies, who takes on social injustices, powerful and greedy villains, has been successful in sending subtle messages to his fans who often request him to join politics.\nWill the star, whom even Mr Modi wished on his birthday, retire from the movies and join politics this time around?\nRajinikanth, for his part, keeps the fans and politicians guessing in movie-style suspense.",

        "source_text": "That is what might have been said to dozens of students at Atlantic College, Vale of Glamorgan, during the 1960s and early 1970s.\nAnd, incredibly, they went on to do just that  by creating the the Rigid-hulled Inflatable Boat, or RIB.\nWith its solid bottom and flexible sides, the RIB has become a cornerstone of modern boating, with umpteen variations in use for leisure, by the military and, crucially for this story, in life-saving.\nFor the RIB began life as an idea by teenagers studying at the boarding school housed in 12th-Century St Donat's Castle on the Welsh side of the Bristol Channel.\nThe college, founded in 1962 by the German educationalist who also set up Gordonstoun School which was attended by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince of Wales - was run by a retired RN rear admiral, Desmond Hoare.\nSo, with sailing and canoeing on the timetable, combined with a commitment to hands-on community work by the 220-odd students at the time, it is perhaps no surprise that the college also had its own inshore lifeboat station.\nThose students who took to the water for fun were the same ones who had to take turns four hours per week in the rescue boats for others doing the same thing.\nThey quickly came to the conclusion that the all-rubber boats they had for the job could be improved to better cope with the rough and tumble conditions of the Bristol Channel.\nDavid Sutcliffe, a member of the college's founding staff in 1962, has since written a book about those pioneering days: The RIB: the Rigid-Hulled Inflatable Lifeboat and its Place of Birth - the Atlantic College.\nHe said: \"They key thing was marrying together a high performance hull and a rubber tube.\"\n\"The students were always full of ideas. They did the building. We must have built 30 boats in the 1960s. They were all taken out and bashed around.\"\nThose prototypes were made using marine plywood, with students spending hours in the workshop fixing the wood and rubber together.\nMr Sutcliffe said: \"Desmond Hoare had a simple motto: if it works, improve it, if it doesn't, chuck it out.\n\"We had lots of experiences of it going wrong. If it was no good for our work on the Bristol Channel, then the boat came back in pieces.\n\"We went to sea every day throughout the year, so it was a tough research station.\"\nSlowly, improvement by improvement, the students all but carved out a template for the modern-day light, fast, powerful RIB.\nAlong the way, this included equally pioneering innovations such as \"wheeled\" steering for the outboard engines and removing the transom to allow water to flow out.\nThe breakthrough in recognition came in 1969 when two Dutch students built a boat for a team in a round-Britain powerboat boat race.\nTheir entry, Psychedelic Surfer, took just three weeks to construct. This included perfecting a twin-engined wheeled steering.\nThey came in a credible 19th out of some 60 entries, beating many boats with small fortunes invested in them.\n\"It was the hero of the race. This proved that this type of boat could stand up to the worst conditions, outperforming many types of boat,\" said Mr Sutcliffe.\nThe RNLI was one of the first organisations to see that the RIB was the future.\nThe charity took on the idea and perfected a glass-reinforced fibre model, the B-Class Atlantic 21, named in honour of the college.\nAll this for \u00a31, which was how much the charity paid to purchase the patent the rear admiral had by then submitted.\nBut he never cashed the cheque, and money remains a \"painful\" issue, according to Mr Sutcliffe.\nHe said valuations of the RIB market suggest an early patent would now be earning \u00a315m a year.\nHe said: \"We lost an opportunity of funding the college. It would not have occurred to Desmond to get a commercial advantage out of it.\n\"One can only look back and say that that was a might-have-been.\"\nBut the college's loss has been boating's gain.\nThe Atlantic 21 became part of the RNLI fleet in 1972 and by August 1993 it had made 15,601 launches and saved 4,717 lives.\nA boat made from the original mould created by the students has gone on display at the National Waterfront Museum's Frontiers Gallery in Swansea until the end of May.\nHugh Fogarty, RNLI head of fleet operations, said: \"The rigid inflatable boat was one of the biggest leaps in small boat design since the introduction of the inflatable.\n\"In the early days Atlantic College students and staff involved in the design worked collaboratively with the RNLI.\n\"Today the RNLI's two models of rigid inflatable lifeboat, the work-horses of the RNLI fleet, are classified as \"B-class Atlantic 75  and Atlantic 85\" in recognition of the designs' origins - a true testimony to those who designed and developed it.'",

We have to remember that,\" he said.\nThe president warned that turning against America's Muslim communities would be exactly what Islamist extremists in the so-called Islamic State group want.\nMedia reaction to Obama's speech\nMr Obama told Americans that terrorism had entered a new phase, from large scale attacks by al-Qaeda to less complicated attacks by radicalised individuals.\nHe said the US would draw upon \"every aspect of American power\" to combat IS.\nHe underscored that the US and its allies have increased their bombing of Islamic State oil infrastructure and would continue to train and equip moderate rebels in Iraq and Syria.\n\"Our military will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters in any country where it is necessary,\" he said.\nThe president added that there are a number of things that can be done on home soil to combat terrorism.\nHe called for stricter gun control and said he had ordered the Departments of State and Homeland Security to review the K-1 fiance visa programme under which the female attacker in San Bernardino originally entered the US.\nThis was only the third Oval Office address of Mr Obama's presidency - they are reserved for events of national importance.\nRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted to criticise the length of Mr Obama's statement, which lasted just over 13 minutes. \"Is that all there is? We need a new President - FAST!\", Trump said.\nMr Trump, who has been criticised for what many see as anti-Islamic pronouncements, added: \"Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.\"\nSenator Ted Cruz, a rival of Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, said: \"On December 7, 1941, in response to Pearl Harbor, FDR did not give a partisan speech, rather he called on Americans to unite and 'win through to absolute victory'.\"\nUsing a different name for IS, he added: \"If I am elected President, I will direct the Department of Defense to destroy ISIS. And I will shut down the broken immigration system that is letting jihadists into our country. Nothing President Obama said tonight will assist in either case.\"\nFormer governor Jeb Bush said the president's remarks were \"weak\". Mr Bush said: \"This is the war of our time. It shouldn't be business as usual. We need a war-time Commander-in-Chief who is ready to lead this country and the free world to victory.\"\nResponding to the address, Florida senator Marco Rubio said Mr Obama's strategy was \"absurd\" and called for increased surveillance efforts. \"We need to be able to gather more intelligence, not less intelligence,\" he said.\nOhio governor John Kasich said the president's strategy was \"not enough\" and called for the US to deploy ground troops against IS. He said: \"Without taking the fight to ISIS on the ground, ISIS won't be defeated.\"\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of HP, said the speech was \"vintage Obama\". \"No strategy, no leadership. Politics as usual,\" she said.\nGeorge E. Pataki, former governor of New York, controversially said Obama's address was \"as believable as a hostage video\". He said: \"Pathetic response to the worst attack on US since 9/11.\"\nPresident Barack Obama for the first time made a clear connection between a series of deadly attacks on US soil during his time in office.\nThe Boston Marathon bombing and shootings at a military base in Texas, an Army recruiting station in Tennessee and now in San Bernardino all represent a \"new phase\" of \"terrorist threat\" to the US, he said.\nMr Obama's goal was to convince an increasingly sceptical US public that he has a plan to address this danger - which doesn't involve large numbers of US forces in the Middle East, intrusive monitoring of American Muslims or framing the conflict as one with all of Islam.\nWhile the president may find support for a congressional authorisation of military force to fight IS, he will anger many with his call to prevent those on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms and place greater limits on the sale of \"powerful assault weapons\".\nMr Obama may have ended his speech by urging Americans to unify around their common ideals, but there are few issues more divisive in the US than that of gun rights.\nObama's call for unity is a tall order\nMr Obama's speech was in response to a mass shooting by a married couple that left 14 dead.\nSyed Rizwan Farook, 28, and his wife Tashfeen Malik, 29, opened fire on an office Christmas party and were later killed in a shootout with police.\nIn his speech, the president characterised IS as \"thugs and killers\", adding: \"The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.\"\nThe group said in a radio broadcast that the couple that carried out the attack were IS supporters, but gave no indication that IS was involved in its planning.\nThe FBI is also looking into reports Malik posted a message on Facebook pledging allegiance to IS around the time of the attacks.\nWho were the attackers?

So it was a very hit-and-miss thing, but eventually we did get it,\" he said.\nSince then he has spent \u00a3180,000 in total on the site and enlisted the help of hundreds of volunteers to dig each summer since 2005.\nThey have uncovered eight buildings, including a fortified manor house and various outbuildings which would have sat alongside the medieval city's market.\nToday, Trellech is a somewhat sleepy village with a population of about 2,800.\nHowever, Mr Wilson, a member of Monmouth Archaeological Society, said in the mid 1200s it became the centre of iron production for the army of the de Clare family.\nThe de Clares were a family of powerful and influential Norman lords allied with Edward I and his bid to conquer Wales.\n\"At its peak, we're talking about a population of maybe around 10,000 people. In comparison, there were 40,000 in London, so it's quite large,\" said Mr Wilson, from Chepstow.\n\"This population grew from nothing to that size within 25 years. Now it took 250 years for London to get to 40,000 people, so we're talking a massive expansion.\n\"And that's just the planned settlement. The slums [to the east of modern-day Trellech] would have been quite numerous. There you would be talking even 20,000 plus. It's a vast area.\"\nMr Wilson's field is beside what would have been the medieval market, where iron would have been smelted and goods traded.\nHe said money and workers would have \"poured\" into the expanding settlement.\n\"If you're working in the fields you are living hand to mouth every single day - it's a really hard existence.\n\"Suddenly, a big industrial town comes here, this is a great opportunity for you.\n\"You up-sticks - to hell with your land - 'let's move to the industrial town where the opportunity is'.\"\nHe said the feudal system would not have been as well developed in the border areas as it was in large parts of England in the 13th Century, so Trellech would have represented a chance for those looking to \"rise up the social ranks\" more quickly than elsewhere.\n\"This was like the wild west,\" he added.\nBuildings he has found on the site would have fallen into ruin by 1400 and would have been entirely abandoned by 1650, after the Civil War.\nCuriously, the area did not have a rich vein of iron ore and, unusually for such a boom town, it was built on a hill. So how did the industry develop there?\n\"The primary iron ore came from the Forest of Dean - that's what actually makes it so weird,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\"You would normally have taken it down into the gorge and then utilised it at Monmouth or Chepstow, in the valleys and then ship it out.\n\"You wouldn't then take it back up the hill and then smelted it.\"\nHowever, the de Clares did not control Chepstow or Monmouth and they wanted to control their own supply of iron to their armies.\nUsing Trellech was a \"strategic power play\" which gave them a wide trade route and allowed them to bypass the Welsh defences of the valleys, Mr Wilson said.\nHowever, it is believed the town as it existed then came to an abrupt end in 1296, when it was destroyed during a Welsh rebellion before being subsequently rebuilt.\nDuring the successive digs, Mr Wilson and his team have found scores of artefacts, including a 15th Century jug, a medieval roof finial for \"scaring off witches\", a rare plant pot and several sharpening stones, as well as silver coins.\nMr Wilson now hopes to turn the site into an attraction and has submitted plans for an archaeological research centre and camp site to Monmouthshire council.\nBut does he feel his financial punt on the site has paid off?\n\"If I had not found anything it would have been a nice place for a picnic,\" he said, \"but it was not as big a risk as people think.\"",

The market leader is Kingfisher's B&Q chain.\nHome Retail Group, which owns the Argos retail chain as well as Homebase, has been put in the spotlight after it emerged that it had rejected a takeover bid from supermarket chain Sainsbury's last year.\nHowever, Sainsbury's has made clear that it is only interested in Argos and it had been expected to sell Homebase if a deal was agreed.\nLast week, Home Retail Group said its annual profits would be at the bottom end of forecasts following disappointing sales at Argos over the key Christmas period.\nAnnouncing the deal, Home Retail Group chairman John Coombe said: \"We are very pleased to have reached agreement with Wesfarmers regarding the sale of Homebase. We believe that this is the best deal for shareholders and for the business.\"\nBunnings managing director John Gillam said the acquisition represented a \"compelling opportunity to enter the attractive UK home improvement and garden market\".\n\"Homebase has an established and scalable store platform with strong representation in high density areas,\" Mr Gillam said. \"The stores are well-sized for the UK market and support warehouse merchandising,\" he added.\n\"We will combine essential local elements with the best of Bunnings to bring customers in the UK and Ireland an exciting new home improvement and garden offer.\"\nIf Wesfarmers can transfer some of the Bunnings magic to the UK, consumers will be in for a treat. The vast warehouses are well laid out and signposted, and seem to employ knowledgeable, friendly staff.\nBunnings is clearly doing something right. Woolworths, which owns the main competitor to Wesfarmers' supermarket chain Coles, has failed to convince many Aussies to switch to Masters - the DIY chain it set up four years ago.\nThe loss-making business has been a drain on Woolworths and contributed to the three profit warnings the retailer issued last year. Shares in Woolworths have slid almost 23% in the past 12 months, compared with a fall of just 6% for Wesfarmers.\nMy builder mate in Brisbane says he is sticking with Bunnings because Masters is more expensive and doesn't have the same product ranges.\nIt's likely that Wesfarmers will use its existing supply deals for its UK Bunnings stores, which could mean more competitively priced products.

What we've seen over the last few hours is the pound plummeting in value by as much as 10% at certain stages.\"\nPlayers could be more reluctant to move to clubs in the UK if the value of their potential salaries has fallen, added Chadwick.\nHowever, the Premier League said it would continue to be a \"hugely successful sporting competition that has strong domestic and global appeal\" regardless of the referendum result.\n\"Given the uncertain nature of what the political and regulatory landscape might be following the 'Leave' vote, there is little point second guessing the implications until there is greater clarity,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Clearly, we will continue to work with Government and other bodies whatever the outcome of any process.\"\nSome Leave campaigners argued that a post-Brexit UK could lower freedom-of-movement restrictions on the rest of the world.\nAnalysis carried out by the BBC in March of squads in the first two tiers in England and the Scottish Premiership revealed 332 players would fail to meet the current standards.\nScottish club Hamilton Academical admitted it may have to change its recruitment policy, with manager Martin Canning indicating seven or eight of his squad could be affected.\nHowever, the rules could be watered down to make it easier for non-EU players to come to the UK - as is the case with Norway and Switzerland.\n\"The work the BBC did earlier in the year identified players like N'Golo Kante at Leicester, who would currently fail work permit regulations,\" said Chadwick.\n\"There will need to be a process of negotiation and this may take a year, two years, who knows, before we get to a system of how we will deal with overseas players.\n\"The summer of transfer activity that we are used to, the kind of rumours of big signings, we should expect a period of restrained activity until the players, the agents, their clubs, the Premier League, and everyone involved in football, are sure about what's going to happen.\"\nTaylor said the work permit process was \"evolving\" and that the domestic game would continue to be attractive to overseas players.\n\"The feeling is that football is above such matters and will cope with it. Football is not just about Europe. The European federation is of massive influence but football is a world game. It is a global game and we are a global village,\" he said.\nChadwick said there could be a knock-on effect for events such as Euro 2020, with the semi-finals and finals due to be played at Wembley in London and potentially involving European Union nations.\n\"Here are two sets of foreign workers who come to this country to ply their trade and they are going to be awarded prize money.

Extra-time beckoned, but in the last act, McHugh turned in a long throw-in.\nHis strike sent the home support into total delirium; Hibs face another long season in the Championship, their third in a row.\nSome of the matches between these teams have had an epic quality to them and this one was the most breathless of the lot.\nFalkirk were bright and accurate in the opening stages and were ahead when McHugh played in Alston to beat Conrad Logan.\nIt was a nicely-created goal and a dream beginning for the home side who continued to dominate until midway through the half. Hibs had been flat and unthreatening and in the relative blink of an eye became energised and dangerous.\nThey were level when Keatings was hauled down by David McCracken in the box. Craig Thomson's decision to award the penalty was straightforward but he could - and probably should - have gone further.\nMcCracken was fortunate not to be sent off. For the second time in this tie - he got away with a surreal handball incident in the first leg - the Falkirk man had a very lucky escape.\nThomson's punishment began and ended with the penalty - and it was put away in style by Keatings, who sent Danny Rogers the wrong way.\nMoments later, Hibs were ahead. After a woeful first 30 minutes, Anthony Stokes made a contribution, putting in a cross from the left to Keatings, who still, in fairness, had a world of work to do to get his header past Rogers.\nHe angled his effort back across the goalkeeper, the ball almost travelling in slow motion and into the back of the Falkirk goal. It was a rapid-fire and stunning turnaround, a double blow that stunned Peter Houston's team.\nThey don't often stay stunned for long, though. Falkirk have shown all season that they have seemingly bottomless reserves of resilience. They've shown it most especially in recent 2-2 draws against Hibs.. And they showed it again, in the most dramatic way.\nThe game had meandered its way to the 79th minute. There'd been a few half-chances for both sides but nothing too clear-cut. Hibs looked in control. They had Falkirk pegged in their own half and looked comfortable. Then Leahy unleashed that bullet and the narrative changed anew.\nWhen David Gray nodded clear from his own penalty area he can't have sensed what was coming next. Nobody did. As the ball fell from the sky to the floor, Leahy appeared on the scene and rifled it low and hard and true past Logan.\nThe strike couldn't have been any sweeter had Leahy emptied a bucket of sugar on the ball before thumping it home.\nThis great footballing odyssey had a way to go yet. Jason Cummings came on to the field and promptly rattled Rogers' crossbar with a howitzer from over 30 yards out. Rogers got a touch on it and Hibs were denied a sensational winner just two minutes from time.\nJust after, a Stokes header clipped the top of Rogers' crossbar.\nFalkirk looked to be hanging on for extra-time. Not a bit of it. It was fitting that such a pulsating tie had a gob-smacking endgame.\nA Falkirk throw-in from Will Vaulks, a ball bouncing free in the Hibs penalty box and McHugh firing it in off the post.\nIn a word: stunning.

This issue has been discussed with the Trust's Access Group which includes patient representatives and representatives from local disability support groups.\"\nHospital trusts have freedom over their parking policies, however, in August last year, the Department of Health published guidance which said that concessions, including free or reduced charges or caps, should be available for people with disabilities.\n\"We expect all NHS organisations to provide car park charge concessions for disabled people, as outlined in updated guidelines,\" a NHS spokesman said.\nAndrew Haldenby, from the think tank Reform, said that half of disabled people of working age were in work so it was questionable whether free parking was appropriate.\nThe Welsh Government announced in 2008 that hospital car parking in Wales would become free of change.

And I'm really looking forward to the new season, as I think we'll do well under Joe.\n\"Tactically, he'll learn and get better at it. But I do know that the more you do it, the easier it gets.\"\nWorcestershire once again start in Division Two in the County Championship, having finished third last season, when they and second-placed Kent lost out to Essex in the race to win the one promotion place to the restructured new eight-team Division One.\nThat leaves Rhodes' men in a reshuffled 10-team division, which includes relegated Nottinghamshire and Durham, chasing two promotion places again.\nAnd, although they are unlikely to see much of England all-rounder Moeen Ali this summer, they do have a double dose of all-round international quality in the form of their two overseas signings, Australia's John Hastings and, for the T20 Blast only, New Zealand's Mitchell Santner.\nNot to mention potential international stars of the future like Joe Clarke, already part of the England Lions set-up over the winter, and possibly also wicketkeeper Ben Cox.\n\"I did check out some of the betting markets, which surprised me,\" said Rhodes. \"We're long odds and nobody seems to rate us.\n\"But that's a good position to be in, with nothing to lose and and it gives us a chance to prove a few people wrong.\n\"I've always liked being an underdog and it's generally worked well for Worcestershire, apart from the era in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when we had Ian Botham, Graham Dilley and Graeme Hick and were favourites for quite a while.\n\"But it would certainly be nice to surprise a few of these big clubs this summer.\"\nRhodes is very pleased with the county's acquisition of Australia international all-rounder John Hastings, who is scheduled to be at New Road for the whole summer.\n\"Getting the right type of person is very important to us,\" said Rhodes.  \"It always has been. We take a lot of time and effort trying to get it right.\n\"He's a bloke we're very pleased to have in our dressing room, a good club man, like another Australian we had here Andy Bichel was before.\n\"It's so key to the dressing room. I have a saying I often use that it's about getting the right people for our bus and putting them in the right seats.\"\nHastings added: \"I liked the feel of the club when I've come here in the past. They're well led by Steve Rhodes, who is the linchpin of the club.\n\"The reason I was so keen to come was because I liked the way they went about things in the game I've played against them for Durham and I can't wait to get going.\"\nRhodes admits that he has concerns over the imbalance of a 14-game fixture list in Division Two, in which not all the 10 counties will now get the chance to test each other both home and away.\n\"The way they've chopped it up and reduced the number of games makes it a strange system, having 10 teams and only 14 games. But we'll give it a good crack,\" he said.\n\"We know the likes of Nottinghamshire are favourites. They've been a Division One team a long time.\n\"Durham will be strong, even with their 48-point deficit at the start of the season, and Kent will be tough. They proved it last year when they pipped us for second.\n\"But you can look at all the teams and their recruitment has been strong. There's a lot of foreigners coming in playing as locals and non-overseas players.\n\"That may enhance some of the quality of the cricket but it's not great for James Whitaker and the England selectors as it gives them less players to pick from.\"\nWorcestershire's 23-year-old batsman Tom Fell starts this season determined to bounce back to his form of 2015, when he reached the landmark of 1,000 Championship runs, before missing the opening half of the 2016 season following his battle against testicular cancer.\n\"Getting that 1,000 run mark and averaging 40 plus are the kind of standards I've got to set myself if I do want to go to the next level,\" he said.\n\"Last season was always a little bit of a write-off but there is still plenty of time in my career.\n\"I was considered for the England Development Programme and was fairly close although I never actually got onto that tour.\n\"And I was part of the ECB Scholarship going out to Perth so it was nice knowing I was in their minds for potentially going on a tour at some stage.\"",

The open cages are filled with hundreds of squeaking brown and white guinea pigs, waiting for their owner, Maria Camero, to fill up their red water buckets and give them corn.\n\"In the past it was only people living in the mountains who bred guinea pigs but now we've realised it's a good business,\" says Maria.\n\"You can start with something like $100 (\u00c2\u00a380) and that money quickly grows because by three months the guinea pigs can start breeding and they will have up to five babies, so the business grows fast.\"\nMaria and her family produce guinea pigs on a much larger scale now thanks to her son-in-law Alessio Cresci. The Italian fell in love with Shelia, Maria's daughter, and decided to move to Peru and build up their business.\nMaria went from looking after a few guinea pigs to being part of a team breeding hundreds.\nAs well as supplying to local restaurants, they also sell and sometimes donate start-up kits to local farmers who want to get involved, consisting of a breeding pair of guinea pigs and the food and pens that they need.\n\"I have a daughter who is 13 and I can afford to pay for her to go to a better school, I have also paid for my son to go to university and study to be a graphic designer. This business lets me do that,\" says Maria.\nThirty dollars a month is the average wage for a peasant farmer. Many of them are now earning $130 a month, according to Lionel Vigil, the regional director of World Neighbours, a charity that helps them get started.\nThe key to their success is the restaurant business, which can't get enough of cuy. Farmers can sell them to local restaurants for about $8 and to high-end restaurants in Lima for up to $13.\n\"The Incas have eaten cuy for centuries, but in the past it was only farmers in the Andes still eating them,\" says Mr Vigil.\n\"When they migrated to Lima they carried on, and little by little other Peruvians from different backgrounds started to get a taste for it and restaurants started to buy guinea pigs.\"\nProducers are even looking to the US as a market. Ex-pat Bolivians and Peruvians are prepared to pay $30 for a guinea pig that they eat on special occasions, chopped up and deep fried a bit like chicken.\nAt first it was hard to get permission for officials to let frozen guinea pigs into the US where, like most of the world, they are regarded as pets.\nBut with the support of academics and anthropologists, one exporter, Mega Business, has persuaded authorities that this is part of Andean culture and guinea pigs also have a very important nutritional value.\nIn fact, Peruvians have never seen cuy as pets. And although they accept they are small and sweet, their culinary value trumps their cuteness.\nJaime Pesaque is the owner of Mayta, a high-end restaurant in upmarket Lima. He buys about 200 organically fed guinea pigs a month. He says they are high in protein and low in fat.\nTraditionally guinea pigs were served teeth, claws and all as a kind of kebab on the local streets - a method that put many people off. Jaime has found a more user-friendly recipe.\n\"We take out all the bones and cook it the whole night, then we press it for a couple of hours and cook it.\"\nI was dreading trying this national delicacy. I remember those fangs and claws thrust up at me through a train on my way to Machu Picchu. I vowed never to try it. But things change\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nAnd Jaime's version is delicious. The meat is sweet and juicy, a bit like rabbit and pork, and the skin is crispy. He has a new convert.\nMany of the people eating in high-end restaurants are tourists who are eager to try something different - provided it is served in the right way.\nAlthough they will always be seen first and foremost as pets for the majority of people in the world, in Peru guinea pigs are offering a way out of poverty.\nFor more on this story, listen to BBC World Service's World Business Report",

Other organic material, including fossils and pollen, allowed scientists to reconstruct the environment - building up a picture of Britain just after the end of the last Ice Age.\nBut the 2006 dig, by York and Manchester University researchers, revealed \"jelly-like\" demineralised bone samples and wood that was flattened and crumbly. This caused scientists to question whether such precious materials would be safe if they were left in situ.\nDr Kirsty High, lead researcher on the project, explained that environmental changes had altered the chemistry of the site.\n\"The main thing that preserves wetland sites is the lack of oxygen,\" she told BBC News. \"At Star Carr, it is that the water table has dropped.\"\nThis has brought in oxygen, which has reacted with sulphur compounds in the peat to produce sulphuric acid and this \"highly acidic environment\" destroys previously preserved organic materials.\nThe researchers recreated this geochemistry in fermentation buckets in their laboratory. They buried bone and wood samples in separate buckets of sand, garden compost and Star Carr peat for a year, and found that the materials decayed very quickly in their \"micro-wetland\".\n\"If you had another site where the water table had dropped, the same thing could happen. Sulphur is present in a lot of different soils and mineral types,\" Dr High explained.\nThe scientist added that, fortunately, most of the important material was excavated from Star Carr between 2010 and 2013.\n\"We don't think it would survive much longer if it was left there,\" she said.\n\"But in the Vale of Pickering - the whole area - there is quite a lot of archaeology.

She said she would be monitoring progress from now on.\nLord Ouseley, formerly chair of the Commission for Racial Equality, warned that the House's top positions form \"a 'no entry' area for BME employees\".\nThe figures have been released by the House of Lords in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request about the ethnic profile of the House's own workforce, numbering nearly 600, from clerks to catering.\nIt does not include researchers and other staff directly employed by peers themselves, or bicameral staff shared with the Commons.\nThe seven top pay bands range from \u00a349,083 to \u00a3176,226 including the senior clerks and managers of administrative workers.

London's working population is currently 37% BME. But in the chamber itself only 6% of peers are ethnic minority.\nThe ethnic profile of House of Commons staff follows a similar pattern to the Lords, but is less extreme. It has just 6% BME representation in the top seven pay levels, with 40% at the catering level.\nThe Commons launched a diversity scheme in 2012, aiming to improve minority representation at senior levels.

I never wanted them to think I was checking up on them,\" she says.\nA smart fitness-tracking dog collar may sound like a gadget too far, but pet owners are splashing out on all kinds of gadgets to keep track of their feline and canine companions.\nPet tech is a booming industry, with the global market predicted to reach $2.36bn (\u00c2\u00a31.84bn) by 2022, according to Grand View Research.\n\"People think of their pets as a part of their family and with tech adoption growing, it makes perfect sense to innovate in this area,\" says Abhishek Sharma, analyst at market research firm Technavio.\nDan Makaveli, an academic tutor and director at Media Savvy, a digital training agency, uses FitBark, a bone-shaped collar sensor, to track his six-year-old doberman Diego's daily activity.\n\"He's well walked anyway but it gives you a little bit of an extra incentive to do it most days,\" says Mr Makaveli, who lives in Sunderland, north-east England.\n\"I know that by having it, it makes me determined to reach Diego's daily goal of exercise. So if he hasn't reached it and even if it's hail-stoning outside, I will take him for a run around the block.\"\nWith FitBark you can also sync your own fitness tracker with that of your dog's and compare results with other dogs of the same breed.\n\"My wife regularly syncs in with him and they can see where they are on the leaderboard,\" says Mr Makaveli.\nSuper-fit Diego even joined the couple when they took on Britain's Three Peaks Challenge last year.\nIf tracking your pet's fitness isn't enough, you can even order a 3D sculpture of it via a company such as Arty Lobster, watch it live through the Petzi Treat Cam, and organise a video conference with a vet via app-based vet practice Pawsquad.\nAnd if you've ever worried about your pet getting a little bored while you're out of the house, EasyPlay could be the answer. It's a ball that works as both a pet monitor and an interactive toy.\nControlled by a smartphone, EasyPlay - which launches in July - allows owners to watch live video of their pets, talk to them, and remotely control a treats dispenser.\n\"EasyPlay is designed to enhance pet health and fitness in a fun and playful way, for both cats and dogs,\" says Adam Anderson, managing director of Gosh!, EasyPlay's parent company.\nBut do such devices simply make it more acceptable for owners to spend less time with their pets?\n\"The EasyPlay was not created to replace a personal, one-on-one relationship with your pet, instead it is a device that allows you to connect while away and improve your pet's mental wellbeing,\" says Mr Anderson.\nAnd is all this tech really necessary, or just businesses being opportunistic?\n\"With the increasing awareness about pet health, owners around the world are more willing to spend on various types of tech to keep their pets safe,\" argues Mr Sharma.\n\"There has been an increase in pets being lost or stolen and hence it requires continuous monitoring to keep track of them.\"\nBut how about the animal itself? Are the gadgets always comfortable?\n\"Pets feel a little uncomfortable during the initial phase,\" says Mr Sharma. \"Having said that, it is almost like getting used to a regular collar.\"\nAs for the future, given the rising adoption of the internet of things and smartphones, pet tech looks set to continue flourishing.\nAnd for pet owners who like to keep tabs on their pets, that's just purr-fect.",

        "source_text": "There are also dozens of other-worldly 3D-printed structures, some of which seem to resemble buildings.\nThis much you might expect at the annual Bartlett School of Architecture degree show.\nBut held aloft above them in a corner, is a monitor playing a haunting film - an animated  journey through a labyrinth - with a dramatic voiceover.\nWhy is an architect making a film like this?\nIt turns out that architecture students, who can spend five-figure sums on their seven-year training courses, are using their newly-learned digital animation and design skills to break into the world of film.\nThe film's creator, Angelika Vasileiou, explains the appeal of animation.\n\"I've never been so close to designing a space, realising how it feels, before I started making films,\" she says.\nShe looks exhausted as the show comes to a close. Her mind is on what to do after graduation.\n\"There are many possibilities for architects to work in film,\" she says. \"It's exciting, we have the skills. A lot of students are considering film.\"\nMs Vasileiou is a product of Unit 24 at The Bartlett.\nThe unit, explains tutor Penelope Haralambidou, explores the relationship between architecture and film.\n\"Ever since architects began to draw digitally, a crossover with film has been a natural progression,\" she says.\nOn the one hand, this is practical. Architecture firms need to make animation films to dazzle prospective clients. And of course they use 3D software to originate designs and make plans for engineers and builders to follow for construction.\nBut Unit 24 encourages students to go beyond this.\nIn many ways the unit's output resembles that of a film school, at times more David Lynch than Sir Norman Foster.\nThe films encourage imaginative thinking and project management skills, says Bartlett tutor Simon Kennedy. And they also teach students the fundamental principles of design, he emphasises.\nMost students arrive with no animation skills, but within two years are up to speed. They use animation modelling software like 3ds Max, Maya and After Effects.\nThe same software is also used in the visual effects (VFX) industry for film.\n\"Architects tend to have a vivid imagination and a strong visual sensibility,\" says Mr Kennedy.\n\"But this is tempered by their capacity for analysis and problem solving. These characteristics are directly applicable when first designing digital animations, and then executing them effectively.\"\nAlumni of the school have already capitalised on this skills crossover. A group who graduated in 2011 has formed Factory Fifteen, an animation house. Recent projects include animations for Film4 and a visualisation of the Al Rayyan football stadium, made for the press launch of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.\nThere is also ScanLab, which specialises in recreating dramatic 3D environments. Their work includes the D-Day landings for PBS in the United States and classical Rome for the BBC.\nBut is it really that easy to build a film career from architectural foundations?\nOne man thinks so. Ben West is creative director at Framestore in Los Angeles.\nFramestore is a London-based VFX company employing more than 1,000 people that has won Oscars for films such as Gravity.\nAfter graduating in architecture in Sydney in the late 1990s, Mr West combined regular architecture work with a sideline in his true passion - film and animation.\nThis passion culminated in the award-winning short film Fugu & Tako - a buddy movie with a twist. Two Japanese salarymen's lives are transformed forever, when one of them eats a live puffer fish in a sushi bar, with surreal VFX-laden consequences.\n\"The reality, apart from a few extremely talented individuals, is that architecture has become very utilitarian in its focus,\" says Mr West.\n\"I aspired to more creative pursuits and my talents were better suited to film making, so I have no regrets.\"\nWith Framestore he has directed effects on Beyonce videos and Super Bowl half time shows.\nMastering the software was the easy part for an architect, says Mr West.\n\"Good architecture strives to relate to the human condition and tell a story, so, too, do good filmmakers.\nThe mantra at architecture school was always 'form follows function', now it's more about the picture serving the story.\"\nSo why are architects moving into film?\n\"Undoubtedly this is because both professions make use of similar software products,\" says Adrian Dobson, an executive director at the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA).\n\"During the recent recession turnover for UK architectural practices overall fell by more than a third and it was a difficult time for younger architects seeking to establish their careers in architecture, so flexibility in how they applied their skills was a must.\n\"It is probably more ad hoc than a trend, but it is a reasonably well-trodden path.\"\nFrom the employer's point of view, architects \"understand the structure of real-world built environments,\" says Amy Smith, Framestore's head of recruitment.\n\"They also bring a knowledge of the history of architecture and how certain features reflect the time or culture of buildings.\n\"All of these things bring a sense of believability to a computer-generated environment that allows an audience to engage with the story.\"\nBut others have found the transition into film animation more difficult.\nHan Han Xue, a new recruit to Framestore in Montreal, graduated in architecture in 2014 from McGill University. He taught himself animation online.\n\"I would produce things which would baffle teachers, but are elementary in the film world,\" he says.\nBut he admits that \"the skills required are much, much higher than what a highly competent architect would be able to offer.\"\nAnd he doesn't rule out returning to architecture and using his enhanced film animation skills to create amazing buildings, he says.\nDigital, it seems, has helped build a two-way street between architecture and film.\nFollow Dougal Shaw and Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter.",

But each of those nations has to go a step further by formally \"joining\" or ratifying the deal in the form of a communication to the UN.\nParis climate deal: In summary\nAlready some analysts are warning that Brexit will spell the end of French government support for the Hinkley nuclear station.\nBut most of the key decisions affecting the UK will be taken by the next prime minister and the people chosen to run the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\nOf the front-runners for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson has given contradictory messages on climate change over the years. He promised to make London a low-carbon energy leader, but has also cast doubt on climate science.\nMichael Gove previously spoke in favour of tackling climate change, but then tried to trim the school curriculum by dropping mandatory climate change lessons - a plan that was beaten down.\nTheresa May doesn\u2019t appear to have spoken publicly on the climate.\nAmong other possible leadership candidates, Energy Secretary Amber Rudd and Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom both supported increased ambition for the UK on climate change whilst imposing huge cuts on renewables subsidies.\nStephen Crabb has called climate change the greatest challenge of this and future generations.\nJeremy Hunt says Conservative promises on climate change are sincere, and has generally voted with the government on climate change.\nMr Miliband told me: \"I take David Cameron at his word that he cared about these issues - but we don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to succeed him.\n\u201cHe should ratify the agreement before he leaves office because we don't want to end up with a climate change denier or sceptic as prime minister who tries to renegotiate the whole thing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest single issue facing our world; the biggest single issue facing my kids as to whether we step up on this. We have a massive, massive challenge and we\u2019ve got to get on with it.\n\u201cThe French have ratified [the Paris agreement] and as I understand it\u2019s perfectly in our gift to get it done. There is a majority in the House of Commons for it \u2013 so we should get on and do it.\"\nOnly a handful of MPs voted against the Climate Change Act in 2008, and most Conservative MPs broadly support decarbonisation. But there are known ties between Euro-scepticism and climate scepticism.\nLord Lawson, who founded the climate sceptic pressure group Global Warming Policy Forum, was involved in the Leave campaign. Several Euro-sceptic and climate sceptic groups are housed in the same Westminster property, 55 Tufton Street.\nAnd the overlapping groups say both climate change policies and the EU interfere with markets and restrict choice.\nThe Leave campaign complained that EU renewables targets have pushed up the cost of energy and warned that the UK\u2019s energy security will be reduced if coal plants are shut.\nThey said that if the UK left the EU, domestic energy bills could be cut by removing VAT on home heating and lighting.\nMr Miliband said he would support action to scrap \"regressive\" VAT on bills, but he said a big campaign to insulate homes should be introduced too.\nHis fears over the impact of Brexit on climate policy have been widely voiced by environmentalists. Much of our energy and environmental policy is formed in Brussels - including rules on state aid for energy; targets for carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewables; and new product standards.\nStandards were a campaign target by Leave supporters who argued that the EU would deny people powerful vacuum cleaners. Experts said efficiency standards would reduce energy cost and emissions without compromising performance.\nThe EU has brought a huge improvement in UK environment policy on issues like waste, sewage, beaches, air pollution, environmental protection, marine conservation, and resource efficiency - albeit at a cost to taxpayers and bill-payers.\nSome of these improvements - like water treatment - entail huge infrastructure investment that won't be undone. And there is no certainty that laws on environment and energy will be watered down in a new government.\nIn fact, some Leave campaigners argue that on issues like farm subsidies and fishing, the UK will protect the environment better than the EU.\nBut the Global Warming Policy Forum \u2013 influential amongst Conservative MPs \u2013 warned in its latest policy note: \u201cSince the UK will need to sail fast and free post-Brexit, the economic engine must be fuelled as cheaply and efficiently as possible, a requirement that is incompatible with currently applicable EU (climate) regulation, and much of it will consequently have to be rejected.\u201d\nIt pointed to 230 rules affecting energy supply and called for the speedy rejection of three major planks of EU climate policy: the emissions trading scheme, which increases the cost of pollution for big business; the Industrial Emissions Directive which cuts pollution from power plant; and the Renewables Directive, which requires the UK to obtain 15% of total energy from renewables by 2020.\nGiven that the UK played a major role in the Paris climate deal and has also urged the EU to increase ambition on climate change, it would represent a massive reversal to reject EU energy and climate policy at home.\nBut environmentalists complain that that policy has already been undermined by wholesale cuts to renewables subsidies imposed by George Osborne.\nMr Miliband was been accused by critics of inadvertently provoking the government\u2019s subsidy cuts by promising during the last election campaign to freeze power bills. His critics say that forced Mr Osborne into a political corner where he was obliged to cut subsidies in order to trim bills.\nMr Miliband rejected that accusation.\nFollow Roger on Twitter.",

Boeing says this means than in the unlikely event of any future fire or smoke, it would not affect the rest of the aircraft.\nBy Richard WestcottBBC transport correspondent, Nairobi\nFlight ETH 801 between Addis Ababa and Nairobi wasn't exactly a run-of-the-mill flight.\nFor starters, it was full of Boeing executives and the boss of Ethiopian Airlines.

It's the kind of quote that sounds good.\nStill, Boeing will be desperately hoping that its Dreamliner nightmare doesn't come back to haunt it.\nBoeing said it put 200,000 engineer hours into fixing the problem, with staff working round the clock.\nOn Thursday, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a formal \"air worthiness\" directive allowing revamped 787s to fly.\nJapanese airlines, which have been the biggest customers for the new-generation aircraft, are expected to begin test flights on Sunday.\nA total of 300 Boeing engineers, pooled into 10 teams, have in the past week been fitting the new batteries and their containment systems around the world.\nBoeing is expected to complete repairs on all 50 of the grounded Dreamliners by the middle of May.\nIn addition to the Dreamliners in service with airlines, Boeing has upgraded the 787s it has continued to make at its factory in Seattle since January.\nThe Dreamliner entered service in 2011.  Half of the plane is made from lightweight composite materials, making it more fuel efficient than other planes of the same size.\nThe two lithium-ion batteries are not used when the 787 is in flight.\nThey are operational when the plane is on the ground and its engines are not turned on, and are used to power the aircraft's brakes and lights.",

I don't know why I done it.\"\nHe handed over keys to a farm workshop to officers and told them: \"You will need those keys - she's locked in the outhouse.\"\nPolice found her body wrapped in plastic.\nMorgan, worth an estimated \u00a320m, said he started seeing escorts during a \"mid-life crisis\", and had never planned to see anyone more than once until he met Miss Symonds.\nHe claimed she threatened to release explicit photos of him to his family if he did not transfer money to her and sign over a bungalow he was letting her stay in rent free at Pencoed Castle, Llanmartin.\nHe said he loved Miss Symonds and she had been like a \"best friend\", though he always knew she would leave him if the money stopped.\nUsing a listening device in her home disguised as a plug adaptor, he heard her tell another love interest on the phone she would leave Morgan after he signed over his bungalow to her.\nThe court was told he considered poisoning her with antifreeze as a way to get her to hospital to see a doctor about her drug use.\nHe said he was concerned about Miss Symonds' cocaine habit and suicide threats.\nDespite saying \"I done it\" to police after he was arrested, he always maintained he was not responsible for his actions due to Asperger syndrome.\nBut a jury dismissed this claim following a three-week trial.\nMiss Symonds' mother, Deborah, said her killing had been a \"devastating tragedy\" for the family.\n\"Her [Georgina's] beautiful daughter has been left without a mum. Georgina has left a hole in our lives that will never be repaired. All of our happy memories will be kept forever in our hearts,\" she added.\nSpeaking after the verdict was delivered, Det Supt Roger Fortey, of Gwent Police, said: \"This is a tragic case that resulted in the death of Georgina, the loss of a mother, daughter, sister and friend to many.\n\"The actions of Peter Morgan were calculated and he committed the act without emotion.\"",

Let us know by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk\nHowever, on Sunday Mr Gove, the environment secretary, appeared to reject suggestions that taxes would need to go up to meet the cost of any pay rises.\nPay rises for most public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% each year since 2013.\nBefore that, there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers.\nIn addition to the 1% annual rise, some NHS staff also get incremental increases as they progress in their roles.\nThe Conservatives went into the election planning to maintain the cap until 2020, but there are growing calls for a rethink after the party lost its majority in the general election.\nThe pay review bodies cover a wide range of professions, from prison officers and nurses, to judges and senior NHS managers.\nThose covering police and teachers' pay are due to report this month. The cap has been applied across the UK, but the Scottish government has said it plans to end it in Scotland.\nBBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\nArguably the simpler part of the debate has been had - many public sector workers are feeling the pinch, and there is more and more pressure to remove the limit on pay rises. The more complicated bit, who or what would pay for the increase, is a conversation that's yet to happen.\nWhatever Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have said in the last twenty four hours, don't expect anything to happen in a hurry. The first pay review body is not due to report for another few weeks.\nIt seems unlikely that the government will announce any plan to either ditch the cap or promise to accept the decisions of the review bodies before then.\nIt's not in either Theresa May or Philip Hammond's DNA to make quick decisions. Read more from Laura\nFormer Conservative Chancellor Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's Today programme public sector pay was on average higher than in the private sector and controlling it was \"extremely important\".\nHe said cases could be looked at where there were specific issues around recruitment but objected to the \"general pressure that's being applied, the idea that we should abandon restraint of public expenditure\".\nHe said people should not criticise austerity in the same way they might discuss \"too many repeats on television\" and said it was not right for cabinet ministers to \"gang up\" on Mr Hammond, saying they were making the chancellor's position \"very awkward\".\n\"This is not a choice,\" he added.\n\"It is unavoidable that we have restraint on public spending.\"\nInstitute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said \"within the scale of things\" Mr Hammond could \"afford a few billions here and there\", but added the chancellor would be worried that if he gives money to one part of the public sector he will come under pressure to do the same in other areas.\nNHS Confederation chairman and former Tory minister Stephen Dorrell said the pay review bodies should not be \"artificially constrained\" by the 1% policy, saying health service staff needed to be \"properly looked after\".\nAnd former cabinet minister Stephen Crabb said ministers who disagreed with the official government policy should not be in the cabinet.\n\"I don't think it's a great sight seeing different cabinet members giving slightly different messages to the media,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.\nSpeaking on Sunday, Mr Gove did not call directly for the 1% cap to be lifted, but said ministers should respect the \"integrity\" of the pay review process.\nLast week Labour attempted to scrap the 1% cap but was defeated in Parliament.\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said reports on the divisions within government over public sector pay revealed there was \"turmoil\" in the Conservative Party.\n\"They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies', even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,\" the Labour frontbencher told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday.\n\"We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'\"\nAsked what level of pay rise Labour thought was fair, Mr Ashworth said the pay review bodies should consider one in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy.\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",
