        "article": "Aileen Robertson, pictured with now seven-month-old Isaac, who claims she was told breastfeeding was not a reason for her to avoid jury duty . A mother who asked to be excused from jury duty because she is breastfeeding claims she has had her application declined because she can still 'use a bottle'. The comment, said to have been made by an official at Dunfermline Sheriff Court, Fife, has been condemned by breastfeeding campaigners as 'appalling'. Aileen Robertson, 39, was cited for jury service when her first-born, Isaac, was only a few weeks old. She claims she filled in a form asking for an exemption, but received a letter to say she was still to attend court on March 16. The Fife resident then rang to explain that she was still breastfeeding her seven-month-old, but was told that was not a reason to miss jury duty because she could 'use a bottle'. That would mean leaving Isaac, her first child, at home and either feeding him with enough expressed milk to last at least a week or switching to formula. However, a Scottish Court Service spokesperson claimed no formal application had been received, and to state it was denied on the grounds of breastfeeding was 'incorrect'. The situation leaves Mrs Robertson in limbo after she claims court staff on the phone told her to send away a medical certificate by her doctor. Despite doing this, she said she has yet to receive a response and  is expected to attend the court hearing. She said: 'I was surprised when they told me that I had to provide a doctor's note. 'Breastfeeding is not an illness or a medical condition, so why use up precious surgery time getting GPs to write up notes in such circumstances? 'Health services are doing everything they can to promote breastfeeding, so it does not make sense for the court service to make things more difficult. 'There doesn't seem to be any consistency. I have friends who have called up to say they were breastfeeding and were excused, whereas others have had the same issues as me.' She added: 'In my case, I do not have the option of expressing and giving him milk in a bottle because he simply won't take it. I don't even have a breast pump. 'There would be the issue of childcare as well. I'm currently on maternity leave so somebody would have to look after him. He is fed about five times a day so even if he took milk from a bottle it would be almost impossible for me to express that amount if I was on jury duty.' She said there needed to be 'clearer guidelines' set in place to prevent this from reoccurring. She said: 'I understand there is a need to encourage citizens to help the legal process but this should not be at the expense of what is an important public health issue. Aileen Robertson said her son Isaac needed to be fed about five times a day so even if he took milk from a bottle it would be impossible for her to express that amount while on a jury . She said the 'appalling' comment was made by an official at Dunfermline Sheriff Court, Fife (pictured) 'There needs to be clearer guidelines on this. Surely they should just look at a baby's date of birth and realise that they will be too young to leave. 'I think mothers with children under the age of one should be exempt from the service.' The news was universally condemned by those who support breastfeeding mothers. Anna Burbidge of the international charitable breastfeeding support organisation La Leche League GB, said the situation was appalling and being told to give a bottle showed a complete lack of understanding. She said: 'For one thing the mother's health would be put at risk because of the danger of mastitis from not feeding and her milk supply would be disrupted. 'Many breastfed babies will not take a bottle and in addition, will be very distressed in being away from their mothers. Aileen Robertson said there needed to be clearer guidelines on new mothers' responsibilities on juries . 'We would agree that the needs of a baby to be breastfed should always be paramount and that this need to be made clear. 'Mothers are, in effect, being told they must withhold their babies' food from them - and this would be considered completely unacceptable in any other circumstances.' Rosemary Dodds, senior policy advisor with the National Childbirth Trust, added: 'If a mother decides to breastfeed her baby, the judicial system needs to respect her choice. 'Society needs to do much more to support women in their feeding decisions.' A Scottish Court Service spokesman said: 'No formal application has yet been received. It is completely incorrect to say that the application has been declined on the grounds of breastfeeding. 'Dunfermline Sheriff Court was contacted by a potential juror advising that she was breastfeeding and unable to do jury service. 'She was advised about jurors being excused for medical grounds who take preference and to contact her surgery and obtain something in writing. 'The right for automatic excusal from jury service is listed in statute. Anyone else wishing to be excused is normally asked to submit their reasons to the court for consideration and to include any relevant supporting documentation for consideration. 'The Sheriff Clerk will then consider those applications sympathetically but in some circumstances the court may not be able to excuse individuals where to do so would prejudice the conduct of court business. 'It is not our policy to request a medical certificate to support a request for excusal on the grounds of breastfeeding.' The spokesman said the court had an appropriate room available for those who required privacy in order to breastfeed. According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. However, the incident comes after mother Lou Burns, 35, was asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge\u2019s hotel in December last year. The mother of three was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea in December last year. Lou Burns, 35, was breastfeeding her 12-week-old baby (left) at the luxury Claridge's hotel in Mayfair in December last year, when waiters asked her to cover up with a large napkin (right) to avoid 'causing offence' to fellow guests . Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards. At the time, she said:\u00a0\u2018I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' She criticised the hotel\u2019s \u2018Victorian\u2019 policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five-star Mayfair hotel. The demonstration, organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants. Protest: A group of about 40 mothers took part in a demonstration outside the five star Mayfair hotel following the incident . Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into the exclusive Oriental Club in central London, because no under 12s were allowed in. She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn\u2019s Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Club. Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue in December last year, with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson, 34, \u00a0had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby. Classical musician Kathrine Jenkinson was banned from taking her 11 month old baby into an exclusive London hotel . Meanwhile in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'. In June 2014, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant. Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan. Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there. Around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April last year to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.

        "article": "By . Katy Winter . For most women, a man overly attached to his mother is one to be avoided - but, if a new study is to be believed, it seems they may be worth sticking with. Mummy\u2019s boys do better at work and earn more than men who have a less close relationship with their mothers in childhood, research shows. The findings come as part of an epic study by Harvard University, known as the Grant study, into what makes men happy. Men with uncaring mothers earning an average of $87,000 (about \u00a353,230) less a year than those who are 'mummy's boys' Started in 1938 the study, which is still on-going, followed 268 male undergraduate students\u00a0from youth to old age, with . evaluations taking place every two years. It is one of the longest and most detailed studies of human development in history. While the study showed that our personalities continue to change and develop well into adulthood, altering our levels of life satisfaction, one factor from our childhood did seem to persevere in affecting our adult lives. Men who were close to their mother in childhood also performed better and more efficiently later on in their careers . Men who had a close, warm relationship with their mothers were found to consistently earn more money than those who had a distant maternal bond. The salary difference was not trivial either, with men with uncaring mothers earning an average of $87,000 (about \u00a353,230) less a year than those who are \u2018mummy\u2019s boys.\u2019 This amount is taken from when the men were earning their peak salary, generally between the ages of 55 and 60. Additionally, men who were close to their mother in childhood also performed better and more effectively later on in their careers. A strong bond also prevented men from developing dementia in old age. Interestingly there was no such correlation with childhood relationship with the men\u2019s fathers and their working life, salary or productivity as an adult. Instead a loving father-son bond in their youth was linked to a higher level of life satisfaction at 75 and lower levels of anxiety. Long-time director of the study George Vaillant has published a book, Triumphs of Experience, The Men of the Harvard Grant Study, explaining its vast wealth of findings. Alongside the major finding that excessive alcohol consumption was the strongest predictor of unhappiness (predicting earlier death, divorce, depression and neurosis) they also found that liberals have more sex than their conservative counterparts and that high IQ isn\u2019t linked to higher earnings. Vaillant, who headed the research for 42 years has succinctly summed up the basic message as: \u2018The seventy-five years and twenty million dollars expended on the Grant Study points \u2026 to a straightforward five-word conclusion: \u2018Happiness is love. Full stop.\u2019\u2019",

        "article": "Just a stepping stone... A woman models Google Glass, which is being trialled across the U.S. Google hopes one day to use microchips in users' brains . Online advertising giant Google's new wearable accessories are merely a stepping stone to its ultimate ambition - a microchip which can be embedded in users' brains. The company, which uses its search, email and other services to funnel personalised advertising to users, is currently trialling prototypes of its Glass device, which is worn like a pair of glasses. But Google is staking its future on a new service which will use the information it holds on registered users to automatically predict their search needs and present them with the data they want. The ultimate ambition is to literally get inside users' heads: using search queries to read their thoughts and then fulfilling their data needs by sending results directly to microchips implanted into people's brains. Ben Gomes, Google's Vice-President of Search told The Independent that the sinister-sounding vision is far from a sci-fi fantasy and that research had already begun with such chips to help disabled people steer their wheelchairs. 'They are getting a few senses of direction with the wheelchair but getting from there to actual words is a long ways off,' he said. 'We have to do this in the brain a lot better to make that interaction possible. We have impatience for that to happen but the pieces of technology have to develop.' But standing in the way of this ambition is a major civil liberties backlash over claims that Google has conspired with U.S. authorities to open a 'back door' to data it holds on its hundreds of millions of users, allowing spies to monitor their online activities. The company, whose 'Don't be evil' motto has long attracted derision from privacy campaigners, is alleged to have allowed analysts from the National Security Agency to 'mine' the terabytes of personal information it holds. In the so-called PRISM programme, revealed last month in a series of articles in The Guardian, Google and a host of other Silicon Valley firms are alleged to have colluded with the U.S. domestic intelligence agency. As well as Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, YouTube, Skype, AOL, and Yahoo are alleged to have allowed agents access to their data to conduct surveillance on users without court orders. Tainted by scandal: Google faces a civil . liberties backlash over claims that it and other internet firms have . conspired with U.S. authorities to give spies a 'back door' to data it . holds on its hundreds of millions of users . Web-users who want to protect their privacy have been switching to a small unheard of search engine in the wake of the 'Prism' revelations. DuckDuckGo, the little known U.S. company, sets itself aside from its giant competitors such as Google and Yahoo, by not sharing any of its clients' data with searched websites. This means no targeted advertising and no skewed search results. Aside from the reduced ads, this unbiased and private approach to using the internet is appealing to users angered at the news that U.S. and UK governments (the National Security Agency (NSA) in the U.S. and GCHQ in the UK), have direct access to the servers of big search engine companies, allowing them to 'watch' users. Within just two weeks of the NSA's operations being leaked by former employee Edward Snowden, DuckDuckGo's traffic had doubled - from serving . 1.7million searches a day, to 3million.'We started seeing an increase right when the story broke, before we were covered in the press,' said Gabriel Weinberg, founder and CEO, speaking to The Guardian. Although strenuously denied by Google, the accusations contained in leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden have provoked a crisis of trust in the company, as web users look for ways to surf the internet without being tracked. Nevertheless, Google sees its future in leveraging the the wealth of information it holds on its users to present them with ever more personalised services. Glass is merely a part of the company's wider information ecosystem, which it intends to exploit with a new service called Google Now, which will present users with a series of bespoke 'cards' as they log on. They will tell users the local weather, any problems they might face on their commute to work, details of meetings harvested from their Gmail accounts, their favourite sports teams latest results, and so on. The service is based on what Google calls its Knowledge Graph, a vast store of information which, The Independent reports, is growing at an 'exponential rate'. Just a year after the project's launch, Knowledge Graph is said to hold 18billion facts on around 570million subjects. The next step, Mr Gomes explained, is for this knowledge to be 'present everywhere'. Scott Huffman, Google's engineering director, continued the explanation. 'Fast forward a bit and\u2026 I think there is going to be a device in the ceiling with microphones, and it will be in my glasses or my wristwatch or my shirt,' he said.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Last year's inaugural live stream of the Super Bowl got its fair share of criticism, but it did set a precedent for how technology can affect our enjoyment of the year's most-hyped sporting event. This year, Sunday's big game is once again being streamed live online for those who can't camp out in front of their big-screen TVs. Between streaming options, mobile apps and social media chatter, there are plenty of options to take part in what's become a national pastime: eating unhealthy food, joking about the commercials and tuning in to what everyone hopes will be a great game. Whether you'll be watching the San Francisco 49ers take on the Baltimore Ravens at the Superdome in New Orleans, hosting a viewing party or watching solo, here are five ways tech can help you kick off a better Super Bowl. 1. If you're watching online . Super Bowl XLVII itself begins at 6:30 p.m. ET and will be streamed on CBSSports.com and NFL.com to laptops, tablets and smartphones. On CBS's stream, fans can choose from four camera angles to get a better perspective on the action, follow along with a curated Twitter feed, and check out the commercials as they air on TV via an interactive gallery. Real-time statistics and game highlights will also be available. Beyonce's lip-syncing at President Obama's inauguration last week has raised the stakes on her Super Bowl halftime performance. But so has the fact that it'll be the first one to be live-streamed online. (No pressure, Bey.) For the record, she says she'll be singing live this time. 2. If you need to make a beer/soda/chicken wing run . The best-case scenario is that you're well-stocked with snackage and drinks well before the pre-show starts at 6 p.m. and don't have to move an inch until the final whistle. But in case you must tear yourself away from your TV or laptop, there are some mobile apps that'll suffice in a pinch. ESPN ScoreCenter will keep you up-to-date on each play and is available for Apple, Android and Windows devices. If you want to keep it team-specific, both teams in Sunday's game have free mobile apps equipped for the iPhone, Android and BlackBerry. The 49ers Gameday Live app offers team news, real-time statistics and an integrated Twitter feed, while the Ravens roll out stats and news via their official app and mobile site, which hosts live scores. If you're a Verizon Wireless subscriber with an iPhone, there's also NFL Mobile, which offers live video of the Super Bowl. 3. If you're on Twitter . As anyone knows if they've watched a live national TV event with their phone or tablet recently, the best commentary can happen on Twitter and Facebook. The official hashtag to follow is #CBSSuperBowl, although others are sure to pop up during the game. Social-media monitoring company Sysomos has put together this handy infographic of game-related handles to start following. The list includes some obvious choices, like the Twitter feeds for both teams (that would be @Ravens and @49ers), but also those who follow football closely, like Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch, Bleacher Report's Ty Schalter and Matt Loede of NFL Gridiron Gab. For the official word on the game, the New Orleans Super Bowl Committee has its own Twitter account. HLN's website recommends 49ers tight end Vernon Davis and quarterback Colin Kaepernick, along with Ravens wide receiver Torrey Smith and kicker Justin Tucker, as top picks for Super Bowl players who are active on Twitter and photo-sharing app Instagram. Considering her upcoming Super Bowl commercial is already one of the game's most buzzed-about ad spots, we're going to throw in model Kate Upton as well. 4. If you're in New Orleans . If you're attending the game, you've clearly got your viewing problems solved. But there are still a few apps that can make your New Orleans stay more enjoyable. HLNtv.com: Entrepreneur helps you experience N'awlins the right way . Thanks to the results of the Codemkrs Super Challenge, which pulled together developers and programmers for a weekend of Web app creation, there are four apps in particular that you might find useful. The first-place winner was Eat Now! New Orleans, which helps steer you toward restaurants that aren't completely booked. NolaParks helps you locate outdoor activities, parks and playgrounds, while GigsGuru zeroes in on places to find live music. And if you have a great experience with a server, you can share it on HeartBucket, which not only highlights the act of kindness for all to see but also alerts that person's superior. Verizon subscribers can check out the Super Bowl XLVII Guide app for the iPhone, which includes a breakdown of Big Easy restaurants and music venues in addition to official game events. 5. If you're watching alone . Watching the game by your lonesome doesn't have to be lonely. The TOK Football app for the iPad allows you to chat with up to four of your friends while watching the game. And the \"social sports book\" OnSports app for the iPhone help you connect with other fans.",

        "article": "Nailed it: Cobbler, Charles Powell, 69, saw off the threat from Tesco, who withdrew their plan to open a new shoe repair outlet nearby . These days independent shops are all too often struggling and the future looked especially bleak for cobbler Charles Powell. With Tesco planning to open a shoe repair outlet in the supermarket car park opposite, he feared it was the death knell for the little shop that has been his pride and joy, not to mention his livelihood, for 30 years. So the 69-year-old shopkeeper from the small town of Cradley Heath in the Black Country wrote to the store chain\u2019s chairman Sir Richard Broadbent to express his worries\u2026 and in a remarkable David versus Goliath victory, Tesco withdrew its planning application. Mr Powell, who was backed by a petition from 250 customers, said: \u2018You can\u2019t let these big businesses steamroller the smaller shops. \u2018I am not against competition, but as a single trader I couldn\u2019t have competed with a business on a car park supported by such a huge supermarket chain that could open from 8am to 7pm seven days a week. \u2018Besides, there are plenty of empty shops in Cradley Heath high street.\u2019 In what may seem as a surprisingly humane response from the world of big business, Tesco described the support he received from his customers as \u2018heart-warming\u2019 and even invited him to have coffee with the local supermarket\u2019s manager. Mr Powell has run C&C Shoe Repairs since 1984. He refuses to retire because he enjoys his work so much. Like many high streets, Cradley Heath\u2019s has been hit by competition from out-of-town shopping centres as well as online shopping. Mr Powell found out about the Timpson \u2018pod\u2019 offering shoe, phone and watch repairs, plus dry cleaning, photo ID, key cutting and engraving services, from a planning notice that was stuck on a lamppost near his shop. Timpson, which opened its 1,000th shop in Britain in January, announced plans to open at least 150 branches during 2014. Despite objections from traders to the branch at Cradley Heath, planning officers recommended councillors approve the application, which was made by Tesco. They said they accepted there were empty shops in the high street but pointed out that the pod was very small and retailers were welcome in the town centre. Sole trader: \u00a0Mr Powell has owned C&C Shoe Repairs for 30 years . The application was due before Sandwell Council this week, but was ditched by Tesco last week. Liz Johnston, a Tesco customer services executive, wrote to Mr Powell saying she was sorry the proposal had caused him so much worry and telling him that she had contacted the local store and Tesco\u2019s planning department \u2018to see if we could have this decision overturned\u2019. She added: \u2018Given the overwhelming support you received from the residents of Cradley Heath, they have all agreed it would be wrong to open a Timpson\u2019s in this store. \u2018It was heart-warming to see the support you received from your customers. We realise how important your business is to them and are happy to support your continued presence in the high street.\u2019 Mr Powell said: \u2018I have done my little bit for my business and I appreciated Tesco\u2019s decision. You have to help yourself sometimes.\u2019 He added: \u2018I want to thank customers and fellow traders for their tremendous support.\u2019 Mr Powell has put the letter he received from Tesco in his shop window. A Tesco spokesman said: \u2018We always try and do the right thing for the communities we serve.\u2019",

Flynn is a former police officer and mother who feared she had become pregnant . by her teenage lover. The 32-year-old is charged with nearly 100 offences of having sex with the teen. On the prowl: Alysia Flynn, 32, has been charged with almost 100 offences of underage sex with a 15-year-old boy . Investigators . said she hosted drink and drug-fuelled parties at her home in Viera, Florida, . and fear there are other young victims. 'From . what we've uncovered so far from interviews, were pretty confident there are . other victims, and it's not an isolated incident,' said Lt. Tod Goodyear. 'It . appears we've got a woman in her 30s actively looking for high school . boys.' Flynn was . charged with dozens of offences following an investigation that began after the . parents of the 15-year-old boy she was having sex with learned about their . son's affair. Enabling: Police also allege that Flynn held raucous house parties where she gave minors drugs and alcohol . During their inquiries detectives . discovered that Flynn had been having sex with the boy at her home, as . well as other locations. Court . papers obtained by WFTV in Orlando reveal that when Flynn's mobile phone was . seized it was found to contain naked photos of her lover. Police said . this could lead to further charges of child pornography. WFTV also . said the court documents show that the boy's parents were aware of the . relationship for over a year. Other . parents were also concerned that Flynn was involved with an underage student . who played for his High School football team. They . claimed to the TV station they tipped off school officials about the affair . after one of the coaches overheard students talking about Flynn's sexual . relationship with members of the football team. The Brevard County Sheriff's Office has issued an appeal to members of the public with information about Flynn to come forward. Flynn was . charged with 42 counts of lewd and lascivious battery and 53 counts of unlawful . sexual activity with minors, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and . interference with child custody.",

        "article": "By . Corey Charlton . Incoming Centrica boss Iain Conn will receive a pay and perks package worth up to \u00a33.7m when he begins . Bills are to be reduced by \u00a312 a year on average after new price controls were agreed by five of the six companies that run Britain\u2019s electricity network. Regulator Ofgem said the cut has been driven by \u00a32.1billion of savings it has secured from the companies\u2019 business plans since last year. The distribution part . of the energy bill - which accounts for 8% of an annual dual fuel bill - . will be on average \u00a312 a year lower than it is today from 2015 - 2023. However, the incoming chief executive of Centrica - which owns British Gas - is in line for a welcoming pay and perks package worth up to \u00a33.7million when he begins his tenure as boss on January 1. It comes as his predecessor and current Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw is expected to leave with a bundle worth up to \u00a34 million. Critics yesterday branded Laidlaw's sum \u2018a reward for failure\u2019. His . tenure has seen household energy prices increase by more than inflation . every year. The average dual fuel bill now stands at almost \u00a31,300 . a year, compared to \u00a3600 when he joined in 2006. His successor, former BP executive Iain Conn,\u00a0will walk into a \u00a3925,000 salary when he takes up his new role, alongside up to \u00a32.7m in perks and bonuses. The exorbitant salary and welcoming package comes at a time when many families are struggling to pay their energy bills and have been branded as 'insulting'. Labour MP John Robertson said: \u2018The name Iain Conn is about right \u2013 he is conning the public with this insulting salary. \u2018His base salary alone is thirty-five times the average salary and would pay the electricity bill of over seven hundred people. \u2018Mr . Conn has said he will rebuild trust into the sector. He certainly has . not got off to a good start, and is instead living up to his name.\u2019 Centrica yesterday said Mr Laidlaw would not receive 12 months\u2019 pay when he leaves. Sam Laidlaw will leave Centrica with pay and perks package worth up to \u00a34million at the end of the year . But he will get to keep interests in hundreds of thousands of company shares under a host of lucrative rewards schemes. These . will pay out to him if the group hits performance targets in the coming . years \u2013 even though he will no longer be at the firm. He . bowed to public pressure earlier this year by offering to donate his . \u00a3851,000 bonus to charity \u2013 but sparked outrage by accepting a lucrative . share scheme worth up to \u00a32million just days later. He also holds shares in the company worth more than \u00a36million, built up over almost a decade\u2019s service at the group. Last November, Western Power Distribution was the only company to have its prices agreed early after Ofgem judged its business plan for the eight-year period showed sufficient value for consumers. Ofgem returned five out of the six companies' plans - UK Power Networks, Northern Power Grid, SP Energy Networks, SSE Power Distribution and Electricity North West - because they failed to deliver value for consumers. Since then, companies have identified \u00a3700 million of savings and Ofgem has ruled out a further \u00a31.4billion following further analysis. SSE said it was disappointed with a number of elements within the draft determination, including Ofgem's assumptions about the scope of further cost reductions across the industry.",

        "article": "The lawyer wife of movie star George Clooney is set to represent fourteen Irish men who claim they were tortured by the British Army. Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing the victims - known as the 'Hooded Men' - who were subjected to horrific treatment, including being deprived of sleep, food and water for days. Clooney, a 37-year-old international law and human rights specialist, will represent the men at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg as they seek to have their treatment acknowledged as torture. Distinguished: Amal Clooney will join the legal team set to represent 14 Irish men who claim they were subjected to torture methods by the British Government in the 1970s . Newly married: Amal, 37, with her movie star husband George. She has enjoyed a distinguished career as an international law and human rights specialist . The men were imprisoned under the British government's internment programme in August 1971, when more than 340 men were rounded up across Northern Ireland. They were then selected for 'deep interrogation' at a specially-built centre at a British Army camp, and subjected to 'five techniques' of torture, which included hooding, being made to stand in prolonged stress positions, white noise, sleep deprivation and deprivation of food and drink. On their way to the interrogation centre in 1971, some of the men were hooded and thrown to the ground from helicopters. They had been told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but in fact they were just a few feet from the ground. None of the men were ever convicted of any offence. In 1976, the European Commission for Human Rights ruled that the British government was guilty of torture, inhumane and degrading treatment. The case was then referred to the European Court for Human Rights, which ruled in 1978 that while the five techniques amounted to 'inhumane and degrading treatment', they did not constitute torture. Victims: Colm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, (front right) with a number of the surviving victims. They became known as the 'Hooded Men' after revealing details of their treatment . But the case will now be reopened after declassified documents were discovered in the British national archives last year that revealed that the British government had withheld crucial evidence from the European Court during the original hearing. The files show that the British government considered the 'special treatment' as torture and yet senior Ministers still sanctioned its use in Northern Ireland - both claims they had denied before the European Court. The Ministry of Defence has consistently rejected allegations that it used torture. Venue: The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, where the men will take their case . There was controversy last year when it was revealed that some IRA prisoners were afforded pardons while the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated. The government scheme applied to people wanted for paramilitary crimes committed before the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998. Necessary: Former PM Tony Blair, who described the 'On The Runs' scheme as fundamental to the Northern Ireland Peace Processsw . Recently, then Prime Minister Tony Blair said the peace process in Northern Ireland would probably have collapsed without the 'On The Runs' scheme for fugitive IRA members. His Labour government sent about 200 letters to republicans assuring them they were not being pursued by the UK authorities for historical crimes. Last month, Mr Blair told MPs investigating the scheme: 'The issue of On The Runs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it.' The scheme has been in the spotlight after an investigation was launched  when the prosecution of a man for the murder of four soldiers in a bombing in Hyde Park in 1982 was halted after he received one of the letters in error. A review last year into the scheme by Lady Justice Hallett's review was ordered by Prime Minister David Cameron. The review found the scheme had 'significant systemic failures' in how it operated, but ruled it was lawful. Lady Justice Hallett's report found the administrative scheme was kept 'below the radar' due to its political sensitivity, but said it would be wrong to characterise the scheme as 'secret'. She added: 'If there was a lack of clarity and openness, responsibility lies with the UK government.'",

        "article": "(CNN)On any other Wednesday morning, the steps in front of the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium would be packed with kids on their way to class, discussing homework, chattering about last night's TV shows, or laying out plans for the coming weekend. But not today. Instead, students approached in silence, carrying photographs and flowers. In small groups, the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly, or dissolving into tears. At 10:53 a.m. Tuesday morning, this school in the small western German town of Haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km (about 620 miles) away. A Germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to Spain crashed in the French Alps, killing all of those on board. Headmaster Ulrich Wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful, thinking \"perhaps they had missed the plane, or perhaps there was a second Germanwings flight at the same time.\" Instead, the worst was confirmed, leaving him \"stunned and somewhat speechless,\" the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss. \"A week ago Tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip,\" Wessel told reporters. \"What was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy.\" Of the 16 teenagers killed, 14 were girls, and two boys; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed. In a post on the school's website, Wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead, \"who will never again return to us,\" leaving all those concerned \"unutterably sad.\" The teenagers who died were: Linda Bergjurgen, Elena Bless, Lea Druppel, Selina Eils, Gina Michelle Gerdes, Ann-Christin Hahn, Julia Hermann, Marleen Koch, Paula Lutkenhaus, Fabio Rogge, Rabea Scheideler, Lea Schukart, Helena Siebe, Steffen Strang, Aline Venhoff and Caja Westermann. The two teachers were identified as Sonja Cercek and Stefanie Tegethoff. As news of the crash spread, the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial, filled with red and white candles, notes and swiftly-painted signs. \"Yesterday we were many, today we are alone,\" reads one. \"Why?\" demands another, with painful simplicity. Philippa, a friend of many of those who died, told CNN she was shocked by what had happened: \"I knew all of them, they were in my grade. To some I was very close. \"We had already planned things for the future, what we were going to do when they returned from their trip. It is very hard to believed that we cannot do that.\" Grief counselors, chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster. \"I've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve,\" said Wessel. \"I hope we will all get through it, if we share it.\" As the world's media descend on the town, messages of support have come flooding in too. The local newspaper is running an online book of condolence, in which people can leave messages of sympathy and \"light\" virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school. \"A silent hug says more than many words,\" wrote Manuela Donovang. \"Wishing the families, friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead.\" In his message, Udo Hentschel said the suffering of the parents, friends and families was \"incomprehensible, unfathomable\" and offered them his condolences: \"This, the worst of all fates, will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together.\" In an attempt to show that solidarity, schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on Friday at 10:53 a.m., the time the plane crashed. For the classmates of those who will never return, that silence will go on, as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come. \"Our school is no longer what it once was,\" said Wessel. \"In Haltern we had 1,283 students. It is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer.\"",

        "article": "Sir Richard Branson has created his new brand of hotels - the first of which opened this year in Chicago - keeping the female traveller in mind. The entrepreneur has focused on the fairer sex for the Virgin Hotel in Chicago, with a bench in the shower so women can sit and shave their legs to a 'Lovers' Intimacy Kit' in the minibar. Containing condoms and sex toys, the $20 addition is one of the more unusual extras found in the room alongside the reasonably priced snacks (the hotel prides itself on charging accurate prices for food and drink). Scroll down for video . All rooms are two-room 'chambers,' with a separate dressing room and bedroom area. The compartment divider can slide across, if people require privacy when ordering room service . In order to design a hotel that would appeal to women, Virgin held focus groups with frequent female travelers asking them what was on their hotel wish lists. The responses stated they mainly wanted safety and convenience . The 26-storey, Art Deco building's rooms have also been designed with a large vanity table complete with drawers to store make-up and even\u00a0a sliding compartment door with a peep hole separating the entrance and the bedroom, so guests in a state of undress can accept room service without being seen. With additional clothes hangers especially for lingerie and an app called Lucy for calling room service, the hotel certainly appears to favour the females. 'I don't think any hotel caters to the female traveller,' Branson, 64, told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal. 'It will give Virgin an edge to make sure we look after them.' 'We're taking into consideration the rise of female business travellers, and appreciate what it means to our success as a brand.' Women can shave their legs on a bench in the shower for safety, (left), and do their makeup with the light of a back-lit magnifying mirror, (right) The wardrobe comes with his and hers section, complete with shoe racks and separated hangers for lingerie . The chamber is separated in two sections, separated by a sliding door, with a peep hole. This allows room service to be ordered, and modesty protected . The hotel has caused a stir for more than just its unusual mini bar offerings. When it was unveiled in January, the hotel also showcased a room key vending machine instead of a check-in desk and even free drinks at happy hour. The hospitality group, which includes everything from airplanes to mobile phone plans, has long made eliminating fees and surcharges a top priority. So it's perhaps no surprise that WiFi is free and room service is available at no additional cost. At the heart of the property is The Commons Club, a members-only inspired space where guests can drink, dine and mingle. Some of the quirky additions at the hotel are designed to make female travellers feel comfortable and offer a sense of 'fun' It's here that visitors can also take advantage of Social Hour - like happy hour, but better - where all drinks are free between 6pm and 7pm. Guests can plug their music into a USB port in the room to stream their own favourite bands, or take advantage of the free music albums on the TV, specially curated for the hotels. The hotel is located in the historic Old Dear Born Bank Building, a Chicago landmark, and offers 250 guest rooms, which start at \u00a3140. Virgin Hotels has plans to open a second location in Nashville in summer 2016 and a third property in New York City in the fall of 2017, with 20 locations by 2025. 'Chicago is an exhilarating and historic city, and a place we're happy to call home for the first-ever Virgin Hotel,' said Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels. 'It's an exciting time for our team as we get to unveil our new approach to room design, service, and entertainment within the hotel industry. The hotel is not the only one to offer intimate toys up to its guests. The Drake Hotel\u00a0in Canada provides a pleasure menu, alongside the standard room service. And Ushuaia, the celebrity-filled party hotel in Ibiza, comes with its own erotic kits in rooms, complete with silk handcuffs. The innovative hotel does not have a front check-in desk. Computer screens sitting atop a former cigar bar (the prior tenant was a 1920s bank) where you can access your reservation profile and check-in . 'Chicago is an exhilarating and historic city, and a place we're happy to call home for the first-ever Virgin Hotel,' said Raul Leal, CEO of Virgin Hotels . The Commons Club, a members-only inspired space, offers Social Hour daily, with free drinks from 6-7pm . A 2011 report from the Center for Hospitality Research at Cornell University stated that while females accounted for only a quarter of business travelers in 1991, they now comprise about half, an opportunity Virgin Hotels is keen to reflect in its rooms . The property, at 203 N. Wabash in the Loop, is the first of three planned for the US. Two hotels are being developed in New York and Nashville .",

With the benefit of hindsight it was probably not a wise decision for this laden tow truck to venture onto the thin ice. Having been called out to rescue a hapless motorist who had plunged into a frozen lake surface, the salvage crew fell victim to the same fate. The bungling mechanics found themselves needing rescue after driving on to the treacherous water at Xining in Qinghai province in the northwest of China. Trapped: A salvage truck sits half submerged in the lake ice after falling through the brittle surface . The comedy of errors began when a local sports club decided to stage a party on the lake. Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, wanted to get into the swing of festivities and decided to liven up the event by taking his car for a spin across the ice. But he and his friends were forced to leap out quickly when they ice in front of the car cracked sending the front-end sinking into the frozen lake but then wedging on the rim of the ice. Eyewitness Lee Shen said: 'He was lucky it didn't sink immediately but stuck on the rim of the unbroken ice allowing him and his pals to jump out. Entombed: A salvage crew venture on to the thin ice to begin trying to free the sunken vehicle . Danger: Visitor Kuan-Yin Ma, 38, decided to take his car for a spin across the lake - not realising how thin the ice was in parts . 'People on the shore went to help by using heavy wooden poles to try and leave the car back out but that was really foolish because it levered it off the edge - where it sank into the ice hole.' A rescue truck that was on the scene then tried to help. But acting on bad advice that it was quite safe the truck also drove onto the ice, where it then fell through and also became stuck leaving both vehicles stranded. After the ice then froze around both vehicles it was decided to wait until it thaws sometime after the spring Festival when they hope to be able to remove both vehicles. Sinking feeling: Rescuers attempt to retrieve an off-road vehicle which fell through ice at Xining in Qinghai province in the northwest of China . On thin ice: A man called for a salvage truck to help pull his off-road car out of a frozen lake in which he had become stuck .",

        "article": "Washington (CNN) -- A Marine who defied orders and braved a blizzard of enemy fire to recover wounded and dead fellow American and Afghan troops during a six-hour firefight in Afghanistan received the Medal of Honor Thursday from President Barack Obama. \"I know that you've grappled with the grief of that day, that you have said that your efforts were somehow a failure because your teammates didn't come home,\" Obama told Dakota Meyer, who became the first living Marine to be recognized with the nation's highest military honor for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. \"But, as your commander-in-chief, I want you to know it's quite the opposite. You did your duty above and beyond, and you kept the faith with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps that you love.\" \"The award honors the men who gave their lives that day, and the men who were in that fight,\" Meyer said, according to a Marine newsletter. \"I didn't do anything more than any other Marine would. I was put in an extraordinary circumstance, and I just did my job.\" The incident began before dawn on September 8, 2009, as a patrol made up of Afghan forces and their American trainers were making their way on foot up a narrow valley in Kunar province to meet with elders in a village. Meyer was about a mile away when Taliban fighters ambushed the patrol, firing from three sides, Obama said. Meyer and Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez could hear the ambush over the radio as the Taliban fighters unleashed a firestorm from nearby hills, Obama said. Soon a number of men were killed and several Afghans and Americans were pinned down, including four members of Meyer's team, Obama said. \"Four times, Dakota and Juan asked permission to go in; four times they were denied,\" Obama said. \"It was, they were told, too dangerous.\" But Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez left their relatively safe location and jumped into a Humvee, with Meyer manning a gun in the turret, his body and head fully exposed to a rain of fire from AK-47s, machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Obama said. As they reached wounded Afghan soldiers, Meyer jumped out and loaded them into the Humvee, then drove them back to safety, Obama said. \"Those who were there called it the most intense combat they had ever seen,\" the president said. For a second time, the men drove back into the hail of fire to pick up more wounded Afghans; when one gun jammed, Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez switched to another vehicle, Obama said. On their third trip, they found a group of wounded Americans \"desperately trying to escape the bullets,\" Obama said. \"Juan wedged the Humvee right into the line of fire, using the vehicle as a shield. With Dakota on the guns, they helped those Americans back to safety as well. \"Dakota later confessed, 'I didn't think I was going to die; I knew I was,'\" Obama said. \"Still, they pushed on.\" They made a fourth trip, and then a fifth. On the fifth trip -- now accompanied by others -- they reached the bodies of the four members of Meyer's team. \"Dakota jumped out and ran toward them, drawing all those enemy guns on himself, bullets kicking up the dirt all around him,\" Obama said. \"Dakota and the others who had joined him knelt down, picked up their comrades and, through all those bullets, all the smoke and all the chaos, carried them out, one by one.\" Meyer agreed to accept the medal in their names: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, Petty Officer Third Class James Layton and Gunnery Sgt. Edwin Johnson. \"I was a failure,\" Meyer told CNN last fall. \"My guys died. That was my whole team.\" Neither Obama nor the Marines saw it that way. A defense official with knowledge of the award process last fall said that just before he retired, the U.S. Marine commandant, Gen. James Conway, recommended Meyer for the nation's highest award for bravery. The actions of Meyer, 23, saved the lives of 13 U.S. Marines and soldiers and 23 Afghan soldiers, according to the Marines' Medal of Honor account. He also is credited with killing at least eight Taliban insurgents during the incident. For his role in the battle, Staff Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez received the Navy Cross, the second-highest decoration that may be bestowed on Marines. Meyer, who serves in the Inactive Ready Reserve of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve as a sergeant in his home state of Kentucky, said in November that he didn't want to discuss details of the incident because it was still difficult to think about. On Wednesday, Obama and Meyer had a beer together on the patio outside the Oval Office. According to a series of tweets by White House spokesman Jay Carney, when a member of Obama's staff called Meyer over the weekend to prepare, \"Meyer made a special request. ... Meyer asked the staffer if he could have a beer with the president.\" Meyer is only the second Marine to earn the Medal of Honor from the current wars. In April 2004, Marine Cpl. Jason Dunham was leading a patrol in an Iraqi town near the Syrian border when a person in a vehicle dropped a grenade. Dunham hurled himself on top it, using his helmet to try to blunt the force of the blast. He died eight days later and received the honor posthumously. CNN's Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report .",

The unconscious man, later identified as 34-year-old Bradley Hayes of Hesperia, was taken to an area hospital as resuscitation attempts were made en route. Those attempts were unsuccessful and Hayes was soon pronounced dead. A subsequent investigation showed the trio who called police weren't telling authorities all they knew. According to\u00a0Gardena Police Lt. Steve Prendergast, all four of them were acquaintances. Police believe the surviving trio assaulted the man, though their reasons remained unclear, and his injuries proved fatal. A cause of death had yet to be determined Monday pending the completion of an autopsy. The suspects, all of whom hail from the city of Hawthorn, all remained detained over the weekend. Police responded to a call to this truck in Gardena, California on Friday evening. They found 34-year-old\u00a0Bradley Hayes unconscious. The trio claimed they knocked him out in self-defense but police charged them each with homicide after efforts to revive Hayes were fruitless.

Tammy Meyers, 44, had just finished taking her 15-year-old daughter out for a driving lesson when a man shot her outside her home on Thursday. Meyers died Saturday after being taken off life support and her killer is still on the run. In addition to surveillance footage of the car believed to have been used by the shooter in the incident, police have also released a sketch of the suspect. He has been described as a man in his mid-20s, \u00a0standing 6-feet tall, weighing about 180 pounds with spiked dirty blond hair and blue or hazel eyes. Police say the car he was driving, seen in the footage, is a gray or silver four-door sedan that may have damage to the front and side of the vehicle. Scroll down for video . On the run: The surveillance footage above shows a four-door sedan wanted by police in connection to a deadly shooting last week in Las Vegas . Overreaction: Police say one of the passengers in this car shot dead 44-year-old mother Tammy Meyers after getting into a road rage argument on Thursday . Meyers' bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the two other accomplices who were in the car along with him. 'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it\u2019s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.' Police believe the shooter followed Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire. She died Saturday evening, a family member told ABC News. Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday . Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. Suspect: A 6-foot man with blond., spiky hair aged around 25 opened fire on Meyers as her children watched. Her 23-year-old son returned fire on the suspect's car which held 'several people' according to reports. Those people remained at large as of Sunday morning . 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves. Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said. She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. He described the girl as emotionally distraught. Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car. Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said. Investigators were looking for the shooter and possible two other men in the vehicle. Meyers, 49, said he was in Los Angeles on business when the shooting occurred. He said he believed the two cars crashed at some point; the Buick had slight damage to molding on the passenger side. Vowed to find suspects: Mrs Meyers' husband, Robert Meyers, said his 15-year-old daughter who was driving is distraught. He believes the family's car and that of the suspect crashed at some point before the deadly shooting . 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive,' Robert Meyers told the AP before addressing reporters outside their home (pictured) where the shooting happened about 11:30 p.m. Thursday.

Caterham F1 has been sold by Tony Fernandes and his partners to a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern owners, who are led by former Midland and HRT F1 principal Colin Kolles. Under the terms of the deal, the team will continue to race as Caterham F1 and will retain their base at Leafield, 75 miles north west of London. It will be run by former Dutch F1 driver Christijan Albers, who will be assisted by Manfredi Ravetto, replacing current team principal Cyril Abiteboul. \"We are aware of the huge challenge ahead of us given the fight at the bottom end of the Championship and our target now is to aim for tenth place in the 2014 Championship,\" said Albers in an official statement. \"We are very committed to the future of the team and we will ensure that the team has the necessary resources to develop and grow and achieve everything it is capable of.\" It ends a four-year stint in the sport for Fernandes, who combined his role at Caterham with being chairman at football club Queens Park Rangers, who recently were promoted to the English Premier League. In closing his Twitter account, Fernades, who is the founder and chief executive officer of Asia's first low-budget carrier Air Asia said: \"F1 hasn't worked, but love Caterham Cars.\" Caterham, who are sponsored by CNN, finished bottom of the constructors' championship in 2013 and are struggling again this season. Their drivers -- Japan's Kamui Kobayashi and Marcus Ericsson, of Sweden -- are yet to register a point after eight races. Caterham joined F1 in 2010.",

Beau Robert Bartlett responded to an advertisement through online classifieds site Craigslist in December. Police believe the man who posted the ad on Craigslist - more commonly used to sell furniture and find flatmates - had been seeking 'male companionship'. Bartlett allegedly arranged to meet the man outside his home in Liverpool in Sydney's west. He allegedly held the man at knifepoint and ransacked his unit, getting away with personal documents. Beau Robert Bartlett responded to an advertisement through online classifieds site Craigslist in December before allegedly robbing at knifepoint the man who posted the ad looking for 'male companionship' 'It appears the whole meeting had been allegedly set up for the purpose of an armed robbery,' Detective Sergeant Graham Hibbs said. Bartlett has no fixed abode and police believe he may be moving between NSW and Queensland. There is a warrant out for his arrest. The exploitation of dating applications has been linked to recent high-profile crimes, including the alleged murder of a woman on the Gold Coast last year by a man she met on Tinder. Chat applications, such as WhatsApp and WeChat also present a challenge to police as criminals turn to the technology to lower their chances of detection. A NSW Police spokesperson said peer-to-peer applications evaded the scrutiny of more public platforms including Facebook and Twitter. Detective Acting Inspector Paul Grace said there have been several cases in recent years linked to dating and chat apps and sites being exploited . 'Police certainly have concerns that a range of criminals including drug dealers and pedophiles are operating in that space and taking advantage of that hidden communication,' the spokesperson said. Detective Acting Inspector Paul Grace said there have been several cases in recent years linked to dating and chat apps and sites being exploited, including a man who was robbed at gunpoint by two men he arranged to meet through Skout. The offenders were sentenced to four years' jail. Det Sgt Hibbs said people using the internet to set up romantic encounters or other meetings needed to tread with caution. 'You don't know who you are meeting or if the other person's intentions are as genuine as your own,' he said.",

PlayStation Home, which can be downloaded free of charge, will allow PS3 gamers to interact, communicate and share gaming experiences through their own personal \"avatars,\" or three-dimensional virtual representations of themselves. Users will be able to chat to each other in Home Square -- a kind of PlayStation clubhouse -- before heading over to the bowling alley to bowl, play pool or use the gaming arcade. They will also be able to access music and video. Users will eventually be able to customize their avatars and virtual apartments with the latest virtual clothing from designers such as Diesel and furniture maker Ligne Roset. Sony also plans to introduce Red Bull Island, where users can jump into the cockpit of a Red Bull Air Race plane and compete against other Home users. \"The idea behind Home is to create a virtual space for PS3 owners to meet up, talk and play games - the easiest way to think of it is as a hybrid of Facebook, Second Life and the prettiest game lobby ever,\" Tim Clark, editor in chief at Official PlayStation Magazine UK, told the BBC. All you need to download Home is a PlayStation Network account and access to PlayStation Store. Providing you have the latest system software update installed, the Home icon will appear under PlayStation Network on the PS3 Home Menu (XMB). \"PlayStation Home is truly a promising network community service on the PlayStation platform, made possible with a combination of the power of PS3 and the PlayStation Network that covers many countries around the globe,\" said Kazuo Hirai, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment on the company's Web site.",

The justices said they will review an appellate ruling that upheld bans on same-sex unions in four states. The case will be argued in April and a decision is expected before July. Gay rights advocates like Vin Testa (pictured) will anxiously await a resolution to the gay marriage debate just months from now . Hilary Matheson (left) and Kay Flatten (right) kissed after they were pronounced 'married' by Rev. Allison Farnum at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Fort Myers, Fla., on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2015; they had been together for 28 year before they weer allowed to legally tie the knot . Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee are among the 14 states where gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to marry. The number of states that permit same-sex marriage has nearly doubled in three months as a result of federal and state court rulings. The justices' decision to turn away same-sex marriage appeals in October and allowed some of those rulings to take effect. Florida last week became the 36th state to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. If the high court rules that the bans in the current case violate the U.S. Constitution, gay-marriage floodgates in the remaining 14 states would open. The justices made their decision during a closed-door conference, opting to dispose of the issue in April, the last month for oral arguments before their next term begins in October. Written arguments will have to be filed on a compressed schedule, though both sides are well versed in the issues after numerous rounds in lower courts. On Friday the Supreme Court met in closed conference to decide whether it would take up cases including several concerning same sex-marriage and marriage recognition by states . In October, the justices offered no explanation when they passed up appeals from both sides calling on the court to take up gay marriage. The appeals before the court come from gay and lesbian plaintiffs in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. The federal appeals court that oversees them upheld same-sex marriage bans there in November, reversing rulings of federal judges in all four states. Louisiana is the only other state that has seen its gay marriage ban upheld by a federal judge. In June 2013 the Supreme Court got the ball rolling with a ruling that struck down a federal law which denied certain federal benefits to same-sex married couples. The decision, Judges around the country later seized on the language in . the decision, written by swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, to . strike down a series of state bans.",

        "article": "By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 06:46 EST, 12 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:42 EST, 12 March 2013 . Utilities giant General Electric has been accused of avoiding paying taxes as it was revealed that it is the American company with the most profits kept overseas. The company said in a February 26 regulatory filing that it was holding $108billion in profits outside of the US at the end of 2012, up from $102billion the previous year. And, according to analysis of 83 major US firms by Bloomberg, that amount is the highest of any of the biggest firms in America. Utilities giant General Electric is the American company with the most profits kept overseas according to analysis from Bloomberg. Its chief executive Jeff Immelt, pictured, has described the US tax system as 'old, complex and ineffective' General Electric said in a February 26 regulatory filing that it was holding $108billion in profits outside of the US at the end of 2012, up from $102billion the previous year . General Electric has faced criticism previously for holding profits overseas in a bid to avoid paying tax, with claims made by the New York Times that the firm paid no tax in the US at all in 2010. Those allegations are 'untrue' company spokesman Seth Martin told the\u00a0Huffington Post. The company said that it did not intend to bring the profits back to the US and that most had already been reinvested abroad. But it is by no means the only company keeping large proportions of its profits overseas. Further analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that 60 big US firms kept on average more than 40 per cent of their annual profits overseas. Not only is the US missing out on revenue from taxes by companies keeping profits abroad, the cash will also not be used to invest in US business or payed out to shareholders. Many companies say that a growing amount of their profits are from increased sales overseas and have set up foreign subsidiary firms. Some other major firms, including web giant Google, have doubled their profits kept overseas in the past year, according to Bloomberg . It was claimed in a separate Bloomberg report that some US companies have increased their stash of profits by as much of 14 per cent in the last year and some firms including Google, Microsoft and Apple have doubled theirs. Drug manufacturers Johnson & Johnson and Merck both saved around $2billion by keeping their profits overseas according to Bloomberg. Many politicians, including Senator Charles Grassley want a crackdown on such practices. Although General Electric claims that its tax burden was low in 2010 because of huge losses in profits made during the economic downturn, campaign group Citizens for Tax Justice claimed that the company paid an average rate of just 1.8 per cent in tax between 2002 and 2011. Its Chief Executive Jeff Immelt described the US tax system as 'old, complex and uncompetitive' and said that it is having a negative effect on the country's economy.",

        "article": "There have been plenty of spectacular catches in Twenty20 cricket but Trent Boult's effort for New Zealand against West Indies tops the lot. Boult was standing on the boundary when West Indies' Kieron Pollard mowed Corey Anderson into the leg-side. The ball was going over his head so the New Zealand fielder caught it with one hand (which was remarkable in itself) and threw the ball up into the air to avoid carrying it over the boundary for six. Pouched: Trent Boult takes the catch with his right hand as he falls backwards towards the boundary . Keeping his eye on the ball: After throwing the ball up to avoid taking it over the rope with him, Boult turns . Taking off: As the ball comes back down, Boult gets his body and hands into position . Superman: Boult has lift-off as the ball comes down into his hands . Boult from the blue: The New Zealand seamer takes the stunning catch, diving to his left . All in a day's work: Boult looks nonchalant after taking the superb boundary catch . The best was yet to come however, as Boult sprung back into action, and dived forward and to his left to take the stunning catch. They say catches win matches, but this one didn't as New Zealand slumped to 126 all out chasing 165 in the second Twenty20 match. Boult's effort is possibly even better than the catches taken by the Aaron Finch/Adam Lyth combination for Yorkshire this summer. They teamed up to great effect against Lancashire in the Roses match, with Lyth taking the ball on the boundary and throwing it to Finch as he headed over the rope. And the roles were reversed last week against Leicestershire, when it was Finch who did the initial work and Lyth took the catch. That one was even better. But are either better than Boult's stunner? Judge for yourself below. VIDEO: Lyth and Finch combine against Lancashire . VIDEO: Finch and Lyth against Leicestershire .",

        "article": "Philadelphia police this morning identified the two brothers who have been charged with the murder of a police officer who was gunned down while trying to stop a video game store robbery. During a press conference held at 11.15am Friday, Philadelphia Police Capt. Darrell Clark named the suspects in the fatal shooting of Officer Robert Wilson III as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30, . Williams had two prior arrests, while Hipps had six arrests and had been out on parole since 2009 following a robbery conviction. The pair of suspects have been charged with murder and attempted murder. Partners in crime: Carlton Hipps (left), 30, and Ramone Williams (right), 26,\u00a0have been charged with the murder of a police officer inside a Philadelphia video game store . Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side . Wilson, 30, was in a north Philadelphia GameStop in full uniform buying a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades when the two suspects entered and announced a robbery. Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said. 'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters Friday. 'He fought to the end.' Wilson's partner, Officer Stevenson, was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene. One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. According to police, Williams confessed to the fatal robbery, telling investigators during questioning that he and his brother had thought the GameStop was going to be an easy target. Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC\u00a0reports. Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two boys, ages 1 and eight. His older son will celebrate his 9th birthday Monday. GameStop:\u00a0Wilson was in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop (photographed) as part of his patrol duties when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery . Struck:\u00a0Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office) Procession:\u00a0A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office . Never Forgotten:\u00a0Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten' 'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.' Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm.\u00a0Another weapon, an AK-47, was recovered during a search warrant at one of the suspects' home, Ramsey said. In all, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store. Police say both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports. Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators. A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office. At the news conference, Ramsey said he met Wilson and his partner when they took part in a recent pilot program in which officers wore body cameras. He described the father of two as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.' 'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.' Volunteer: Wilson (left) was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting . Condolences:\u00a0Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues . Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten.' Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues. 'This senseless act is devastating and a stark reminder of the danger faced everyday by our brave men and women in uniform,' Wolf said. 'Across Pennsylvania, members of law enforcement and our first responders put their lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. We can never forget their selfless service and sacrifice.' Wilson is the fifth Philadelphia Police officer to die due to a gun shot wound since 2007, according to the Fraternal Order of Police.",

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . Updated: . 09:44 EST, 14 November 2011 . Accused: Peter Roebuck arriving at court for his trial in 2001. The former Somerset captain plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match . Cricketer turned commentator Peter Roebuck had been accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old male Zimbabwean student before he died, it was reported today. The alleged victim laid a charge of indecent assault against the former Somerset captain on Saturday after the pair apparently met through Facebook, a South African newspaper claimed. The New Age quoted a police officer, who reportedly confirmed a case had been opened at the Claremont police station in Cape Town. The article stated: 'When The New Age queried an indecent assault charge laid at Claremont police station and spoke to Capt Malusi Mgxwathi on Sunday, Mgxwathi said: \"This is the same man who committed suicide at the hotel\".' The paper said that Mr Roebuck had met his Zimbabwean accuser last week after arriving in Cape Town to cover South Africa's test match against Australia. The newspaper said it was believed the former cricketer arranged to meet the young man to discuss the possibility of helping him attend university. It said: 'The pair later met at the hotel, where they were allegedly meant to discuss a possible university sponsorship for the male Zimbabwean. 'The New Age source said Roebuck allegedly tried to seduce the Facebook friend and have sex with him against his will. 'The man reportedly went to Claremont police station and laid charges of indecent assault against Roebuck.' The New Age report also offered further alleged details of the moments before Mr Roebuck's death. The newspaper claimed the broadcaster was due to be arrested but asked to change his clothes before leaving the hotel. The report stated that he then moved towards the window and leaped out. The Southern Sun Hotel in Cape Town, where Peter Roebuck fell to his death . Further investigation: Police are set to question 16 young men who lived with Mr Roebuck at his South African home . It continued: 'When police confronted Roebuck in his hotel at about 9pm on Saturday, with the intention of effecting an arrest, the British man allegedly asked to be allowed to change his clothes. 'In the process he managed to move close to a window and jumped out.' South African police declined to comment on the report. A spokesman said: 'An investigation is underway and the matter will be subject to an inquest. 'At this stage we cannot give any further information on the matter.' Mr Roebuck, 55, plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match. According to sources, he became agitated when a detective and a uniformed officer from the South African police sexual crimes unit arrived to interview him at the Southern Sun hotel in the suburb of Claremont. Mr Roebuck phoned fellow cricket journalist Jim Maxwell to help find him a lawyer and contact a group of underprivileged boys he had been supporting near his South African home. Old enemies: Ian Botham, left, and Roebuck, right, in 1987. When Roebuck backed a Somerset club committee decision not to renew the contracts of  West Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for Roebuck . \u2018Can you come down to my room quickly, I\u2019ve got a problem,\u2019 he said in the desperate phone call just after 9pm on Saturday. Minutes later, with the uniformed officer still in the room, Mr Roebuck plunged 70ft to his death, hitting an awning as he fell. Paramedics were called to the hotel, a short walk from the Newlands cricket ground, and Mr Roebuck was pronounced dead at the scene. Police seized items from his hotel room, including a laptop computer. Mr Roebuck had spent part of his last day alive with members of the Australian cricket team, who had lost their first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday. He regularly toured with the team as a distinguished writer and broadcaster for the Australian media, following a career in county cricket during which he played 335 first-class matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1988. A distraught Mr Maxwell, one of the last people to see Mr Roebuck alive on Saturday night, gave a statement to police yesterday. After retiring from cricket in 1991, Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket . The Australian Broadcasting . Corporation cricket commentator, well known to British audiences for his . work on Test Match Special, said he had seen nothing to suggest Mr . Roebuck was contemplating suicide. \u2018Things happen. As far as I could see . at the Test, there wasn\u2019t a problem,\u2019 said Mr Maxwell. \u2018He was a person . who had a great sense of humanity and caring. That was Peter. \u2018There were a lot of other things . about him, but we\u2019ve lost a wonderful friend and supporter.\u2019 He . described Mr Roebuck as \u2018one of the outstanding writers on the game of . cricket\u2019. Police spokesman Captain Frederick . Van Wyk confirmed Mr Roebuck\u2019s death was being treated as suicide, but . would not give details about the sexual assault allegations. In his long playing record, one . incident stood out \u2013 a spectacular clash with Sir Ian Botham when he . replaced him as Somerset captain in 1985. When Cambridge-educated Mr Roebuck . backed a club committee decision not to renew the contracts of\u00a0 West . Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was . furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for . Mr Roebuck. Roebuck forged a successful career as a writer after his playing days . Part of the team: Roebuck (third left on the back row) played for Somerset during the 1980s with Sir Ian Botham and Sir Viv Richards . After retiring from cricket in 1991, . Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one . of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket. He divided his time between homes in . Bondi Beach, Australia, and the South African town of Pietermaritzburg, . where he was helping a group of underprivileged boys through school and . university. Mr Roebuck, who was unmarried, was at . the centre of controversy in 2001 when he received a suspended jail . sentence for common assault after beating three teenage cricketers . across their bare buttocks with a cane. The South African boys had been invited to stay at his former home in Taunton, Somerset, for coaching in the late 1990s. Henk Lindeque, one of Mr Roebuck\u2019s victims, said yesterday he was \u2018shocked\u2019 to learn of the cricket writer\u2019s sudden death. \u2018I haven\u2019t had any contact with him . since the trial,\u2019 Mr Lindeque said. \u2018The problem was not so much that he . caned us but wanted to examine the marks. That\u2019s when I decided to get . out of his house.\u2019 Mr Roebuck, one of six children born . in Oxford to teacher parents, was apparently estranged from his family . for much of his adult life. On his website, he included . contributions from his \u2018extended family\u2019 of underprivileged boys from . South Africa and Zimbabwe \u2013 some of them cricketers \u2013 whom he assisted . with school fees, coaching or getting jobs.",

        "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Upcoming forced government spending cuts will heavily impact the Federal Aviation Administration, triggering flight delays nationwide and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said Friday. \"Travelers should expect delays,\" LaHood told reporters in calling for fellow Republicans to work toward compromise to avert the worst impacts of $85 billion in across-the-board cuts set to take effect March 1. The full impact won't be felt until April as furloughs and other staffing reductions of air traffic controllers come into effect, said LaHood, who has announced his intention to step down from President Barack Obama's Cabinet. \"Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff,\" LaHood said. \"Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country.\" In addition, control towers at smaller airports such as Boca Raton, Florida, and Joplin, Missouri, would be closed, he said. Asked why he was brought to the White House briefing room to address reporters, he said: \"I would describe my presence here with one word -- Republican.\" \"They're hoping that maybe I can influence members of my own party\" to compromise with Obama and Democrats on an alternative to the mandatory spending cuts agreed to in a 2011 deal to increase the federal borrowing limit, LaHood said. LaHood is a former member of the House of Representatives from Illinois. In a letter to airline associations, the Defense Department and other \"aviation colleagues\" released on Friday, LaHood said plans under consideration to absorb the mandatory spending cuts included furloughs for most FAA workers, eliminating midnight shifts in 60 control towers and shutting down more than 100 towers at smaller airports. The FAA operates towers at more than 400 airports nationwide. The Homeland Security Department has separately warned of longer security lines at airports if budget cuts take effect, another potential headache for air travelers. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

Armed robbers stole watches worth thousands of pounds after holding terrified staff at a hotel boutique at gunpoint in a raid that detectives fear may be the work of a notorious criminal gang. Thieves threatened staff at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Mediterranee hotel on the upmarket Promenade des Anglais in Nice shortly after 7am this morning. The gang targeted watches which were displayed in a reinforced case next to the hotel's jewellery boutique. Terror hotel: The robbers threatened staff at the Hyatt Regency Palais de la Mediterranee hotel in Nice shortly after 7am this morning . Police are exploring the possibility . that the heist could be linked to the Pink Panther gang made up of . ex-soldiers from places like Serbia and Ukraine. The . gang has been targeting jewellery collections for almost 15 years, . stealing up 330 million pounds worth, often from Riviera resorts like . Nice and Cannes. A . police spokesman said that the robbers left the scene on scooters and . that the value of their haul has not yet been calculated. The . robbery is the latest in a long list of raids which have targeted the . upmarket hotels and shops on the seafront around resorts like Nice. Police are linking the heist to a series of other robberies on the French Riviera which they are connecting with the Pink Panther gang. The Carlton hotel in Cannes, pictured, was targeted last month . The . authorities in nearby Cannes pledged to tighten security last month . following a record-breaking raid at the world-famous Carlton Hotel, . which is a favourite of Hollywood stars ranging from Elizabeth Taylor to . Angelina Jolie. A lone gunman wearing a crash helmet . and scarf to cover his face walked into the hotel on a Sunday lunchtime . before brandishing his pistol at staff. He . walked into a bedroom where \u00a390 million worth of diamonds and . jewellery-encrusted watches were stored and tipped the valuables into a . briefcase before escaping through a set of French windows. Cannes is renowned for its jewellery thefts \u2013 many of which take place during its annual film festival in May. A Cannes Kronometry luxury watch store was also raided in July. French connection: Police investigate the raid on the Carlton, another high profile hotel targeted by thieves in a string of raids on the French Riviera . Police are exploring a possible link with the heists and the escape of a member of the notorious Pink Panther organised crime gang. Milan Poparic was released from a Swiss jail by accomplices brandishing AK-47 automatic rifles, making the third Pink Panther to have got out of prison in as many months. The gang are said to be able to \u2018launder\u2019 stolen jewels in eastern Europe after driving them overland from the places where they were stolen. Police and hotel staff in French hotels frequently complain that jewellery firms frequently place minimum security around their stock.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- There I was, having an epiphany. I had just run close to 3 miles with my 24-year-old son, and wishing I had been in better shape to enjoy more activities with my kids when they were younger. Why did I wait so long to get healthier? How much did I miss out on by not taking the time to take care of myself? Training for a triathlon has made me aware of the side benefits of exercise -- benefits that expand past the point of gaining strength and losing fat. I have never been particularly goal-driven; I seemed to thrive by getting through life \"by the seat of my pants.\" But this year I have realized the benefit of having goals, both large and small, and of working to achieve those goals. What a motivation boost it is to see how much progress I have made, especially in my running. When I first started running in January, I couldn't make a half-lap around a high school track without getting winded. Yesterday, after bike riding for almost an hour and a half, I was able to run over two miles in 30 minutes. There is no way I would have been able to progress to that point without goals and coaching. This side benefit has bled into my professional life. By setting small goals, I feel that I am better able to focus on tasks and am more efficient with the demands of my workday. My ability to do athletic activities other than the three triathlon sports has improved as well, telling me that my overall fitness and coordination have improved. My job in the hospital can involve a great deal of walking, lifting and twisting. I can now work a 12-hour shift and finish with more energy than I would have before I started training. That dying patient could have been me . My wife has gotten into biking and running with me. We both agreed that whatever happens, we cannot stop what we are doing after the triathlon. Not only do we not want to lose our momentum, we both have enjoyed the journey, supporting and encouraging each other along the way. Even my golf swing feels better (though anything would have been an improvement!) I am turning 50 in July, but I don't feel 50. Other than the occasional soreness that comes after a workout, I don't have the aches and pains of middle age. I sleep so much better than I did years ago. Some have told me that I don't look like I am that old -- what a shot of confidence that gives me! Since beginning training, I don't feel irritable toward the world; I actually enjoy each day as it comes. It has been a long time since I have felt depressed or discouraged. Before you call me Pollyanna, know that I am not always the happy-go-lucky guy I would like to be every second of the day. But I do think that because I am exercising my body, my mind benefits as well. The negatives of life can be met with a better attitude and fresh perspective. How we approach the events of life often determine their outcome. If I come to a bump in the road grumpy, sluggish and depressed, how much more severe is that bump going to be? I have come to realize that life is too short to needlessly suffer the consequences of inactivity and procrastination. Get out there and do something -- something you enjoy. Give yourself the gift of a better day by making an effort to strengthen your body and improve your mind. You are fearfully and wonderfully made; take advantage of that and follow me and the rest of Fit Nation Sassy Six as we work to live the second half of our lives better than the first.

        "article": "(CNN) -- Long before Europeans began settling in Australia, people from India arrived on the continent and interbred with the aboriginal population there, a new study says. The Indians may also have introduced dingoes to the vast Australian landmass, it suggests. Last words: Phone app bids to save dying aboriginal language . The genetic scientists behind the study are challenging the conventional view that the humans who first arrived in Australia at least 40,000 year ago remained essentially cut off from outsiders until European mariners showed up in the 17th century. In an article published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, the team of researchers says an analysis of the genetic history of Australian Aborigines and other peoples indicates the contact with Indians took place roughly 4,000 years ago. That period coincides with the arrival of the dingo in Australia, according to archaeological records, suggesting the Indian migrants may have brought the wild dog with them, the genetic study says.

The Indians could also have prompted changes around that time in the Australian inhabitants' tool technology and food processing, according to the scientists, who work at German and Dutch research institutes. They based their findings on large study of genetic data from aboriginal Australians, New Guineans, island Southeast Asians and Indians. Their analysis supported the theory that indigenous groups in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines are descendants of a wave of migration out of Africa tens of thousands of years ago. But it also showed what the scientists called \"substantial gene flow\" between the Indian and Australian populations \"well before European contact.\" They estimated that the Indian-Australian interaction took place 4,230 during the Holocene, the current geological period.",

A consultant lost his job at an NHS hospital after carrying a sample of HIV-infected blood in his hand luggage while flying from Africa to the UK, a High Court judge heard. Tubonye Harry - who was a genito-urinary specialist at the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk - was returning from Nigeria, where he did private work, Mr Justice Burnett was told. The judge said the sample should have been packed in the aircraft\u2019s hold and Dr Harry had breached regulations designed to prevent passengers being exposed to infection. Dr Harry had also broken rules by opening a package containing the sample at home instead of in a laboratory, the judge added. He was dismissed by James Paget bosses earlier this year. 'The transportation of human blood is governed by strict regulations,' said Mr Justice Burnett. He added: 'On a return journey from Nigeria in . December 2010, Dr Harry accepted that he carried two samples of blood, . one infected with HIV, in his hand luggage. 'He said that they were appropriately . packed in accordance with the regulations, but agreed that the . regulations required them to go in the hold. He said that he had been . unaware of this. 'The second aspect is that he opened . the package in which the samples had been transported at home. He then . took them to the laboratory. The regulations require that samples be . opened in the laboratory. Disciplined: Tubonye Harry was a genito-urinary specialist at the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, Norfolk . 'The rationale behind these strictures . is not difficult to divine. Should an incident occur in which a phial . of infected blood is broken there is a risk that people might . inadvertently come into contact with it and be exposed to infection.' Details of the case emerged as Mr Justice Burnett ruled on a dispute between Dr Harry and the General Medical Council (GMC) - which registers doctors - at a High Court hearing in London. Dr Harry, who also faced a number of other allegations relating to his work, has been suspended pending the outcome of GMC disciplinary proceedings, the judge was told. But he argued that the GMC\u2019s 18-month interim suspension was unfair and unnecessary - and the judge agreed. Mr Justice Burnett terminated the suspension, which prevented Harry from seeking alternative work, saying it was 'disproportionate'. Dr Harry qualified as a doctor in 1979 and had been a consultant since 1996. He carried the infected blood from Nigeria in 2010 and lost his job at the James Paget in January. Hospital bosses had then referred the case to the GMC, the judge was told.",

Evidence from Colorado gunman James Holmes' cellphone - including eerie selfies he took just hours before the shooting spree - can be used by the prosecution, a judge has ruled. The images were taken by Holmes before he allegedly opened fire on a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado during a screening of the Dark Knight in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 more. Among the photos, which have only been shown in court, is one of Holmes wearing black contact lenses and a black stocking cap, with two tufts of his orange-dyed hair sticking out like horns. In another, he held a pistol beneath his . face and grinned at the lens. A third showed an assault rifle and . shotgun, magazines for ammunition, tactical gear and bags to carry . rounds arrayed on a bed. Locked up: James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in shooting in Aurora, Colorado in July 2012 took eerie selfies in the hours before the massacre. A judge ruled these can be used prosecutors . Police have testified the photos were . taken about six hours before the July 20, 2012, shootings. Investigators said they also found pictures on his iPhone of movie theater doors taken up to three weeks before the attack, as part of his possible planning, the Denver Post reported. The ruling, which was made public on Monday, also allows for evidence found in Holmes' iPod, computers, emails and bank records to be used by prosecutors. Defense attorneys had argued the . warrant used to seize the phone was over-broad and unconstitutional . because it failed to be specific enough. Creepy: A court sketch shows one of the photos found on Holmes' iPhone. In the photograph, he was wearing a black stocking cap with two tufts of hair sticking out and black contact lenses . Allowed in court: In another image, he held a pistol beneath his face as he looked at the camera . But the judge disagreed and rejected eight defense motions to suppress the evidence. '[N]o date range could have been justified,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. wrote in the ruling. 'Officers . realized that these were no impromptu crimes; extensive planning and . preparation had obviously gone into the shooting and the booby-trapping . of the apartment. 'But they . had no way of knowing whether it had taken months, a year, two years, or . longer to complete such planning and preparation.' Holmes, a 26-year-old former . neuroscience graduate student, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . to more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder. His . attorneys have acknowledged he was the shooter but said he was in the . grip of a psychotic episode. The case now hinges on whether he was . insane. Selfies: These images - which are not part of the contested evidence - were shared on a website, Adult Friend Finder, ahead of the attack that claimed the lives of 12 people and injured 70 others . Scene: Prosecutors are also permitted to use evidence found on his computer, which was found during a search of his apartment (above). The defense had claimed the evidence was gathered unconstitutionally . Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Holmes' trial date is up in the air while both sides work their way through dozens of pretrial motions. As dramatic as the cellphone photos are, they will likely be less important to the outcome of the case than a mandatory sanity evaluation that Holmes underwent at the state mental hospital last month. The verdict on Holmes' sanity is up to the jury, and the evaluation will be a key piece of evidence. The critical conclusions of the evaluation have not been made public, but prosecutors have asked for another by their own experts, saying the doctor who conducted the first one was biased. Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. has not said when he will rule on the request. He held a four-day hearing on the issue last month that was closed to the public and reporters.

        "article": "(CNN)It has all the key points you'd expect on a birth certificate -- baby's weight, length and date of birth confirmed with an official insignia. The difference here is the governing authority's stamp: The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. It's one of many official documents relating to matters such as vaccination schedules, fishing methods and rent disputes in the areas now controlled by ISIS. For ISIS sees itself as a government operating under a rule of law, even if the group is most often talked about for its barbaric punishment of anyone who resists or defies its medieval interpretation of that Islamic law. The ISIS documents, some shared with CNN by researcher Aymenn Al-Tamimi, give a window into the bureaucracy of the self-declared caliphate. Last summer, ISIS fighters swept through the Iraqi city of Mosul. Once they took power, leaders wanted to show they could bring stability allowing daily life to resume. So, they quickly reopened the University of Mosul, albeit under a radically altered curriculum. Notices went out that classes would resume on 24 Dhu al-Hijjah 1435 in the Islamic calendar (or October 18, 2014, in the Western calendar), about four months after ISIS overran the city. But some subjects would be banned -- democracy and political thought, also hotel management and tourism and archaeology. Families flee ISIS in Iraq . \"The banning of archaeology is not a surprise,\" says Al-Tamimi, who is a Shillman-Ginsburg Fellow at the Middle East Forum at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, in Israel. \"We see that reflected in ISIS destruction of ancient artifacts. ISIS regards pre-Islamic artifacts as relics from the 'period of ignorance', jahiliyah. Their main concern with archaeology is that it would become a subject turning to idol worship, which is strictly forbidden in Islam. \"Hotel management and tourism may seem strange as first. But there are no hotels under ISIS. They have all been taken over and shut down, either rented out or become places to house families.\" Mosul University still has the same professors and teachers, Al-Tamimi says. \"But now teachers are subjected to Sharia sessions, to learn what is and what is not acceptable to ISIS. So, they have preserved the prior system but within ISIS Sharia law conditions.\" The ISIS Health Department runs hospitals for anyone feeling ill, not just wounded fighters. It has maternity wards, health clinics, even a mobile vaccination unit. And while an ancient interpretation of religion remains at the heart of rules, there is more nuance than was seen in Afghanistan and areas still controlled by the Taliban. \"This is one thing that distinguishes ISIS from groups like the Taliban, which forbids vaccinations.  Polio is a problem in Pakistan because the Taliban believes the vaccines are a forbidden substance.  But ISIS is not that primitive,\" says Al-Tamimi. \"This is also reflected in education:  The Taliban, forbids all girls' education. But ISIS allows girls to go to school, albeit in a segregated environment.\" However, education for girls is limited to the age of 15. Reporting from areas controlled by ISIS is near impossible but anecdotes of daily life and death do emerge. Al-Tamimi's conclusions on ISIS's governing principles and methods follow similar findings by the Quilliam Foundation, other researchers and social activists. How ISIS makes (and takes) money . It is an Islamic principle to care for the environment, so that's one reason that using explosives to catch fish is banned. And a quote from the Quran saying property owners should lessen the burden on renters to earn spiritual rewards is used at the start of a document outlining a policy on rent control. \"A general theme for ISIS is that they try, initially when they seize control, to portray themselves as more just, more fair to the inhabitants than the previous ruler,\" explains Al-Tamimi. \"For example, in Syria, the first thing ISIS did was lower the price of bread. This is as much about winning over the population as it is about religious rulings.\" At times, such as taking up the case of renters, the regime can seem almost benevolent, Al-Tamimi says. \"If someone does complain, especially in Syria, ISIS does actually try to deal with it,\" he says. \"That's why they've been seen by many in Syria as imposing order, especially in areas where multiple parties, rebel factions and the Syrian government were previously in control.\" ISIS control of its territory is absolute -- bus schedules show routes from Raqqa to Mosul and Qaim with no acknowledgment of the Syria-Iraq border, just the new provinces created by the group for its territory. Detained ISIS members speak from Iraqi jail . And inside that territory, even entertainment is regulated. Foosball can be played, provided there is no gambling and the faces or heads are taken off the figurines to prevent idol worship. A fatwa on entertainment goes on to say that chess, billiards and other \"contemporary games\" do not benefit Muslims but may be played if they do not distract from religious obligations.  It reaches that conclusion from the Quran and other religious teachings. That's also part of ISIS strategy, says Al-Tamimi. \"One of ISIS's goals is to present this very religiously learned image, showcasing their knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence to justify to their following that they are the moral authority.  It's clear that ISIS and their religious clerics and scholars are extremely familiar with religious texts and use them to convince and persuade ISIS followers, which also makes them impervious to any religion-based counterargument.\"",

        "article": "Football agents are threatening to injunct the FA from introducing new FIFA regulations in April, following world football\u2019s ruling body washing their hands of controlling the game\u2019s middlemen. The Association of Football Agents met on Friday and will take legal action against the fresh set of rules governing their conduct. That is if their complaint to the European Commission and a couple of planned meetings in Germany fail to resolve the turmoil. Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA that represents almost all the UK\u2019s agents, said: \u2018We will have no option. It\u2019s a total disgrace that FIFA are passing the buck to national associations having recommended an unworkable code. And it will be the Wild West out there, with anyone able to act as agents.\u2019 Radamel Falcao's (right) agent Jorge Mendes (left) could soon have to adhere to a new set of regulations . Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, insists agents will have no option but to take legal action against the FA . The FIFA recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of \u2018impeccable character\u2019, all deals annually published online, agents\u2019 fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under 18. The FA, Premier League and Football League have been discussing how best to cope with FIFA opting out. All have serious concerns about how the system will work in Britain and abroad, especially in under-developed football territories. A FIFA spokesperson said: \u2018The new approach is about having better control of the activity and follows a lengthy, in-depth reform process with numerous options considered.\u2019 Sepp Blatter's FIFA has decided to opt out of trying to control football agents . There is no chance whatsoever of Gordon Taylor, 70-year-old chief executive of the PFA, being asked to resign by his management committee \u2014 be it for running up huge bookmaking debts or making deplorable comparisons this week between the Hillsborough disaster and the Ched Evans case. Taylor surrounds himself with ultra-loyal staff at his private fiefdom. Graham Bean, the former FA compliance officer who was brought in for a period by Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino to stabilise the troubled club, is himself facing a \u00a3100,000 pension fraud charge in Manchester on January 19. Bean will vigorously defend the charge, brought by HMRC. He will claim to have been victim of a pension scam by a professional advisor who has fled the country after being struck off by the Financial Services Authority. ITV Sport, who have rights to the Africa Cup of Nations starting on January 17, will be producing all their programming from London \u2014 sending no one abroad. Cameroon players train ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations - ITV will not be sending anyone to the tournament . Yet the BBC are spending licence-fee money funding an army of over 20 personnel. They will be going to Africa to service the overblown website, Radio 5 Live and the World Service. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s London embassy report numerous visa applications from the BBC. There is a worry at the top of BBC Sport that the Corporation will lose one of their flagship rights properties this year. The two most vulnerable are Match of the Day highlights and the Open championship. The golf contract is most in danger of being lost to Sky after 2016 \u2014 which Sports Agenda was the first to reveal as a significant threat last July. One thing is for sure. If Sky do capture the Open, there will be no more ridiculous schedule clashing with the Lord\u2019s Ashes Test, which happens again this summer. Rory McIlroy won The Open at Hoylake live on the BBC last year but the tournament could be on Sky in 2016 . There has been an understandably negative reaction in Scotland to flu-hit Mo Farah pulling out of Saturday's Great Edinburgh cross-country international. It is the third time in less than six months he has let down athletics fans north of the border, following his withdrawals from Glasgow\u2019s Diamond League meeting and the Commonwealth Games. Meanwhile, Lord Coe would like to see cross country included in the Winter Olympics to encourage African interest. Joe Williams, from Coe\u2019s first athletics club Sheffield\u2019s Hallamshire Harriers, represented GB in cross country the last time it was included \u2014 1924. Mo Farah's withdrawal from the Great Edinburgh cross-country international has caused a stir . If departing chairman Giles Clarke fails to win enough county support to stay on the England Cricket Board in a new president\u2019s role, Glamorgan chairman Barry O\u2019Brien, a London lawyer, will challenge Notts\u2019 Peter Wright for the vice-chairmanship vacated by Colin Graves succeeding Clarke.",

        "article": "The former wife of jailed sex offender Max Clifford has been pictured wearing what appears to be an engagement ring. Divorcee Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced PR man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks. Since Clifford, 71, was jailed last May, Mrs Westwood has reportedly been seen several times with her former husband, IT consultant Lee, with whom she has a daughter. Scroll down for video . Engaged? In these\u00a0photographs, taken  in the Cotswolds, Mrs Westwood is seen wearing what appears to be a sparkly band on her ring finger, sparking rumours that she and first husband Lee are engaged . Last year, the couple, who separated in 2003, were pictured enjoying time together in Broadway, Wiltshire, where the PR guru and his ex-wife had a \u00a3600,000 country residence. And these latest photographs, taken of Mrs Westwood in the Cotswolds village today, suggest that the couple have taken the next step towards rekindling their marriage. Dressed in a casual outfit and carrying a shopping bag, Mrs Westwood is seen getting into her car with what looks like a sparkly band on her ring finger. The 51-year-old was a volunteer bereavement counsellor for a children\u2019s hospice in Guildford, Surrey, which Clifford became a patron of. He later admitted that he turned to her for support after the death of his first wife, Liz, from cancer in 2003. He began courting her and she worked as his assistant at his London offices. They married after she proposed to him on a golf course in Marbella, Spain. 'Rekindling their romance': Last October Jo and Lee Westwood were\u00a0pictured enjoying time together in Broadway, Wiltshire, (above) where PR guru Clifford and his ex-wife had a \u00a3600,000 country residence . She was notably absent from his trial, however, which featured claims he abused girls as young as 12, and allegations that his extraordinary grooming technique involved telling impressionable young women that he had an extremely small penis. On the very day he was convicted she was seen walking near their Cotswold cottage \u2013 without her wedding ring. Weeks later, a court granted her a divorce in just 105 seconds for his \u2018unreasonable behaviour\u2019, which has caused her stress and heart problems. In October it was reported that Mr Westwood had been seen driving the \u00a3150,000 Bentley coupe Clifford bought his ex-wife as a wedding present. Divorced: Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced PR man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks. Above, at a court hearing last May . Perhaps unsurprisingly, she has splashed out on new personalised licence plates for the car, swapping the letters MAX for JO. Engagement rumours first emerged last year when the Daily Star Sunday claimed Mrs Westwood had been seen visiting a jeweller\u2019s with her ex-husband, and wearing a large ring. A source told the newspaper at the time: \u2018All Jo\u2019s family and friends are really pleased that after everything she\u2019s been through she is happy again. \u2018None of them ever really liked Max. He was a bully and really put her through the mill. \u2018She\u2019s had a really tough couple of years with the allegations against Max but she\u2019s put it all behind her. For the first time in ages she has a huge smile on her face.\u2019",

        "article": "Obama administration officials told a gathering of all 100 U.S. Senators on Wednesday that they were kept in the dark about Saturday's prisoner swap because the Taliban warned that they would kill Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if any information about the plan leaked to the public. But Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, his Democratic counterpart on the committee,  were told 'months and months' in advance when the Obama administration was planning to kill Osama bin Laden. 'It was like they didn't trust Dianne and me,' Chambliss said during an interview on the Fox News Channel, describing his frustration with being kept out of the loop on the Bergdahl hostage swap. 'And yet the two of us knew about the bin Laden event leading up to the takedown of bin Laden for months and months and months,' he said. Yes to the al-Qaeda raid, no to the Taliban trade: Sen. Saxby Chambliss told Fox News that the Obama administration briefed him and other Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about the Osama bin Laden kill raid 'months' in advance, and there were no public leaks . Navy SEALS killed terror mastermind Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan bedroom in 2011; senators were briefed 'months and months' in advance, Chambliss said so finds it hard to fathom that he wasn't trusted with plans for Bergdahl's release (right) 'It's just very puzzling about why they didn't notify anyone in Congress about what was going on,' Chambliss added, referring to the negotiations for Bergdahl's release. U.S. Navy SEALS killed bin Laden, the global leader of the al-Qaeda terror network, May 2, 2011 in a covert nighttime raid on his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound. No information about that operation became public until President Barack Obama announced the news in a triumphant White House event. The Associated Press first published an account of Wednesday's closed-door Senate meeting where lawmakers heard explanations from from the White House about why the Obama administration chose to carry out negotiations for Bergdahl's safe return in secret. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken delivered the presentation, according to two Senate staffers. He told senators that that the administration moved quickly and sought no congressional approval for the release of five Taliban terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay prison because of the Taliban's death threat against Bergdahl if the deal wasn't kept quite. A Senate Republican aide told MailOnline that few on Capitol Hill believe that rationale. 'It's a flimsy argument,' he said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press. 'We have an intelligence committee that meets in a hermetically sealed room. If you can't trust them with the most sensitive information about what the White House is up to, we may as well pack it in and become a monarchy.' 'It's just so much BS. Now we're all going to wonder even more what the White House isn't telling us.' Big guns: Chambliss (L) is the Senate Intelligence Committee's vice-chair and ranking Republican while Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinsten (R) chairs the committee; then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised both that they would have 30 days' notice if anyone was transferred out of the Guantamano Bay prisoncamp . Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken briefed all 100 senators on Wednesday, citing a Taliban threat to execute Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if negotiations were leaked to the public as the reason for a hurried prisoner exchange without putting Congress in the loop . The Fox News interview with Chambliss first aired Wednesday on Greta van Susteren's evening program, and portions were re-aired Thursday afternoon. Van Susteren asked him if the White House also explained why the Senate wasn't notified about the 5-for-1 hostage trade 'five minutes before it went down.' 'I mean, why they didn't pick up the phone at the White House and call you and Senator Feinstein? It would have taken about 30 seconds.' Chambliss was on the same page. 'That was my question to Tony [Blinken],' he responded. 'You guys knew this was going down several days out,' he recalled telling Blinken. 'Why didn't you pick up the phone, particularly since Secretary Clinton had written to Senator Feinstein and me and said, \"We understand the law is we have to give you 30 days notice before the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee. We assure you we will give you that notice\".' 'My comment back to the administration,' Chambliss concluded, 'is that I'm not gonna believe anything they tell me from now on. ... 'How in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us?' Another Republican, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, demanded Thursday that Justice Department tell Congress whyis counseled the White House to move ahead with the Taliban trade in the absence of congressional input. 'Unfortunately, this is the latest instance in which the President has chosen to act unilaterally, without regard for Congress\u2019s role, and contrary to a law he recently signed,' Grassley wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama signed the annual Defense Department authorization bill in December, which included the 30-day congressional notification requirement. 'The public deserves a full and transparent accounting of why the Administration believed it could disregard the law,' Grassley insisted.",

        "article": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:11 EST, 2 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:39 EST, 2 December 2013 . The financial crash saw average working families suffer a \u00a31,700 real terms cut in their income, new figures reveal today. But the same time retired households on middle incomes saw their income rise by more than \u00a3900, despite the turmoil on the stock markets triggered by the global banking crisis. The Office for National Statistics said private pensions increased markedly from 2007 onwards, while those in work saw wage cuts or freezes. Since the financial crash in 2007-08,m incomes of working households (green line) has fallen, while the incomes of retired households (purple line) has risen) The Office for National Statistics said payouts from private pensions have risen markedly, driving up incomes (at 2011-12 prices) New analysis shows how the so-called \u2018median household income\u2019 of average families rises and falls in line with the prospects of the wider economy. Households saw incomes rise as the economy grew, but fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s. Between 2007-08 when before the financial crisis and latest figures for 2011-12, the median income for working households fell by 6.4 per cent from \u00a327,053 to \u00a325,671 at 2011-12 prices. However the median income for retired households grew by 5.1 per cent over the same period, to \u00a319,253 in 2011-12. Average direct taxes paid by the middle fifth of non-retired households have fallen from \u00a38,700 in . 2007-08 to \u00a36,800 in 2011-12 . The ONS said: \u2018The largest driver of this increase was income from private pensions, which grew by 22 per cent. \u2018This was partly due to more recently retired people receiving higher incomes from private pensions, on average. \u2018The other source of growth over this period was the State Pension which grew by 9 per cent for the middle fifth of retired households.\u2019 All households have seen incomes rise in real terms in the last three decades. In 1977 the average household income was the equivalent of \u00a311,200 in today\u2019s prices, compared to \u00a323,200 in 2011-12. The median household income grew by 2.2 per cent on average every year. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Autumn Statement on Thursday to ease the pressure on squeezed family finances. He . is under pressure from some Tories including former Defence Secretary . Liam Fox to offer tax cuts, to allow people to keep more of the money . they earn. But Mr Osborne . has played down the prospect of significant tax cuts or extra spending . commitments as he promised to deliver a 'responsible recovery'. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to use this week's Autumn Statement to ease the strain on family finances . Labour's shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: 'These figures show that disposable incomes for the average working-age household fell by over \u00a31,500 a year in David Cameron\u2019s first two years in Downing Street. 'And after three damaging years of flatlining the cost-of-living crisis under this Government continues as prices are still rising much faster than wages. 'That\u2019s why we need action in the Autumn Statement to tackle the rising cost of living and ensure we can earn our way to higher living standards for all and not just a few at the top. 'But with energy bills still rising this winter after the Government\u2019s announcements, David Cameron and George Osborne look set to fail the test.'",

        "article": "Hundreds of 'lethal' fake Frozen toys and clothes have been seized and destroyed after concerns they could burst into flames and strangle children. The dodgy Disney items, including counterfeit dolls, umbrellas, watches, backpacks and blankets, were seized at a toy shop last week. Shockingly, fancy dress costumes and pyjamas do not conform to 'flammability' standards and are likely to catch fire. The haul comes just weeks ago Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman's eight-year-old daughter  suffered serious burns following a horrific Halloween accident. Some of the fake Frozen goods seized by Nottinghamshire County Council's Trading Standards team which include children's pyjamas, dolls, fancy-dress costumes, umbrellas,  watches, backpacks and blankets . Matilda Thykier's witch costume was set alight by a candle on the doorstep of a house while she was out trick or treating on Friday 31. She was taken to hospital for treatment of severe burns and Zoe Ball stepped in to host Strictly Come Dancing for several weeks after the incident as Ms Winkleman refused to leave her daughter's side. Meanwhile hooded tops were found to have lethal cords which were deemed a strangulation risk. Trading Standards officers from Nottinghamshire County Council seized the fake merchandise from a toy shop in Newark, Notts., during a raid last Tuesday (25/11). Councillor Alice Grice, vice-chair of the council's community safety committee, said: 'Official Frozen merchandise is amongst this year's 'must-have' Christmas presents for children - but unfortunately, counterfeiters who want to cash-in on the craze are all too aware. 'With the high demand for official merchandise, many parents are struggling to find items for sale and may be tempted to buy counterfeit versions. 'However, by doing so parents might be unwittingly putting their child in serious danger. 'Many cheap toys and goods from outside the European Union are often badly-made and in many cases, dangerous. 'We would advise parents to be especially wary when buying items like this from individuals or non-reputable companies on online auction or social media sites.' It is suspected that a number of the items do not conform to EU safety regulations, including pyjamas and fancy-dress costumes that are unlikely to meet flammability guidelines . The Trading Standards team had received a tip-off from a concerned member of the public about the counterfeit haul at a Newark toy shop . The seizure follows warnings by parents last week about counterfeit 'snap' bracelets which were made out of measuring tape and sheets of metal and had fake Frozen branding on. Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released. The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen\u2019s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter. The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than \u00a31billion, while the song \u2018Let it Go\u2019 won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon. The demand for Frozen merchandise is high. With the interactive Frozen Snow Glow Elsa who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of \u00a334.99, tipped to be the most in demand toy this Christmas, stores such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, are struggling to keep up. Some list the item as unavailable while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves. The demand for Frozen merchandise saw another haul of fake toys  seized by trading standards officers last week. The haul of 1,960 knock off toys were seized at the Port of Dover in Kent - including 426 Frozen character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film,was the biggest ever seized.",

        "article": "Sheldon Silver, the longtime leader of the New York state Assembly, will relinquish the position he has held for 21 years in the wake of federal corruption charges, a top lawmaker announced late on Tuesday. The decision announced by Majority Leader Joseph Morelle came after Democratic lawmakers met behind closed doors for two days to discuss their response to the turmoil that has threatened one of the longest careers in American state politics. 'He said to me he will not impede the transition,' said Morelle, surrounded by most of the other 105 Assembly Democrats. 'We'll have a vacancy on Monday.' Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was taken into custody last Thursday on federal charges that he took nearly $4 million in payoffs and kickbacks, but he insists he is innocent . As majority leader, the No. 2 post in the chamber, Morelle would be the acting speaker from the moment Silver resigns until the lawmakers formally convene again Monday. At that point, they plan to amend their rules to keep him as interim speaker until February 10. That's intended to give any other member a chance to express interest and explain how he or she would lead, and make the selection a more open process than it has been in the past, Assemblyman Thomas Abinanti said. 'I think what carried the day is we want to enter the budget process united,' he added, with a new speaker who has the clear, legitimate backing of the Assembly's two-thirds Democratic majority when he or she goes to negotiate with the governor. 'I will not hinder this process,' Silver told reporters later. He declined to respond when asked if he would resign. It is unclear whether Silver would do that or whether his tenure will be formally ended on Monday by legislative action. He has said he expects to be exonerated in the criminal case and has no plans to resign his seat in the Assembly. The 70-year-old Manhattan Democrat was taken into custody last Thursday on federal charges he took nearly $4 million in payoffs and kickbacks, but he insists he is innocent. He has led the Assembly for 21 years \u2014 the second-longest tenure of any sitting speaker in the nation. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called Silver 'a man of integrity' and said on Tuesday that he shouldn't resign . Members of the Assembly said Silver's criminal charges had become a distraction and a problem for entire chamber. 'There is a strong sense among members it would be best for the speaker to step down and for this body to elect a new speaker,' Assembly member Patricia Fahy, D-Albany, said early on Tuesday. 'There is a lot of hard work ahead to move ahead and unite the body behind a new speaker who can best represent the entire state, champion reforms and restore confidence in the Assembly.' She noted, though, that the chamber and Silver have been instrumental in raising New York's minimum wage, legalizing same-sex marriage, funding prekindergarten and other progressive measures. Silver had one vocal ally remaining. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat, has called Silver 'a man of integrity' and said on Tuesday that he shouldn't resign. As majority leader, the No. 2 post in the chamber, Joseph Morelle will be acting speaker from the moment Silver resigns until the lawmakers formally convene again on Monday when he is expected to be announced as\u00a0interim speaker until a vote next month . He added that people have to respect the Assembly's decision, but 'it's crucially important' that there is leadership that's fair to the city, which often doesn't get its fair share from the state government. Some legislators also want rules changed to lessen the central power of the speaker's office and seniority system, establish more transparency in how the chamber operates and make decisions and give the chairmen of Assembly committees more authority. Silver faces five counts, including conspiracy and bribery, and is accused of using his position to obtain millions of dollars in kickbacks masked as legitimate income from two law firms. There was no clear immediate consensus on Silver's permanent replacement. Morelle, Assemblyman Keith Wright of Harlem and Assemblyman Carl Heastie of the Bronx have all been mentioned as likely candidates. Wright said on Tuesday he will seek the position. 'This is the process: You do what you can do to line up support,' Wright said. Silver faces five counts, including conspiracy and bribery, and is accused of using his position to obtain millions of dollars in kickbacks masked as legitimate income from two law firms .",

Authorities in India are attempting to stem any further violence from demonstrations that erupted in reaction to the brutal rape of another girl in New Delhi . Indian students protesting against a recent gang-rape of a young woman in a moving bus in New Delhi. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged today to take action to protect the nation's women . Her family said despite reporting the attack it took two weeks for police to take any action. The victim's older sister told India Today she had lost hope the case would be brought to justice when she suffered intimidation from the accused. She said the victim had approached the police at Badshahpur village: 'On some occasions, the policemen would . take her to the police station in late evening hours. They would seek . her to narrate the incident. They also tried to force her to withdraw . her complaint.' She said the accused men had threatened the family too and all had been forced to go into hiding at another family member's house at Samana - a town near Patiala - on November 29. However, the accused intimidated them there too. It is believed the girl 'consumed poison' at around 5pm on Boxing Day before she was rushed to Rajindera Hospital at Patiala, but she died later that night. It is believed the accused men were named in a 'suicide note' left by the girl. Patiala police are believed to have now ordered an investigation and said police would be 'dismissed from their job if negligence was proved'. Elsewhere an Indian student\u00a0 is battling for survival after she was brutally gang-raped in New Delhi will be treated at a top organ transplant hospital in Singapore. The 23-year-old woman, whose barbaric attack on a bus has sparked outrage and protests across India, was air-lifted from a central Delhi hospital to the city's airport for transfer to Singapore on Wednesday.

        "article": "(CNN) -- A riot on a tiny island in the Pacific that killed no one would usually go unnoticed by the world. But when some 100 asylum seekers burned down their shelters in an Australian refugee processing center Friday on Nauru Island, it did not. Instead, it drew attention to a new restrictive law made in Australia the same day banning \"boat people\" from living in the country. \"As of today asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia,\" said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a statement announcing the law. The asylum seekers did not revolt because of the new law, an immigration spokeswoman said. They may have not even known about it when the mayhem broke out. They are stuck on the island without papers for Australia. The United Nations has called the conditions on Nauru \"unbearable,\" noting that asylum seekers have been gone on hunger strike before because of them. Their alternatives: Go back to where they came from, places such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Iran, or wait in limbo on a lonely island. The unrest began as peaceful demonstrations earlier in the week, but then things got out of hand, the spokeswoman said. The new law will put more people in their position -- marooned on an island with little choice of where to go next. On Saturday, Australian authorities intercepted the first boat smuggling refugees since the law was passed. It was sailing near the Christmas Islands and was crammed full with 81 people, who will face that fate. Starting immediately, all \"boat people\" will be taken to the sparsely populated jungle island of Manus, which is a part of Papua New Guinea. Australian officials Sunday said 15 Vietnamese asylum seekers on Manus were returned home. Middle of nowhere . Nauru Island, where the insurrection broke out, is the epitome of the middle of nowhere. It is roughly 2,000 miles from Australia's shores, where Rudd said in no uncertain terms that \"boat people\" are no longer to tread. There is not much room to roam on Nauru. It is just three miles across at its widest point. And there are not many people to talk to. The nearly 600 \"transferees,\" as they are called, make up 5% of the island's total population. And they speak various languages from Farsi to Pashtun. More than 150 miles of open ocean separate them from their nearest neighbor, which is another tiny island. One-way street . Manus presents a similar situation. People arriving there will have to wait for authorities to determine that they are true refugees, not just people seeking a better life in a richer country. \"If they're found to be genuine refugees, they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea,\" Rudd said. Rudd described the country in optimistic terms as \"an emerging economy with a strong future.\" Those who settle there may find it to be more of a jungle island populated with mostly native peoples, as the CIA World Factbook says. Not much of a replacement for the immigration melting pot they had hoped for. Australia is prepared for an unlimited influx of new asylum seekers to the neighboring country, with its cooperation. \"Our governments will expand existing facilities on Manus Island, as well as establishing further facilities in Papua New Guinea,\" Rudd said. \"There is no cap on the number of people who can be transferred to Papua New Guinea.\" Those not recognized as legitimate refugees would be sent packing again. The government has kicked off an ad campaign on traditional and social media in various pan-Asian languages to warn of the possibility of getting stuck in the new asylum cul-de-sac. It has drawn hefty criticism from some Australian politicians as being inhumane. As a consolation, if fewer boats arrive as a result of the policy, Australia plans to raise the number of legal asylum seekers it takes, Rudd said. Human trafficking and votes . The new law is designed to discourage \"boat people\" from paying human traffickers thousands of dollars to ferry them to Australia on unseaworthy crafts. \"Our country has had enough of people smugglers exploiting asylum seekers and seeing them drown on the high seas,\" said Rudd, who previously served as foreign minister. He is also tired of watching Australian crews risk their lives to fish passengers from waters in front of the Christmas Islands, where rusting buckets carrying them invariably capsize. The number of illegal immigrants arriving by boat spiked between 1999 and 2001, according to the Australian parliament, only to flatline after a few years. There has been a recent uptick, which has become an irritant to some Australians. Rudd, who heads the left-wing Labor Party, faces an election in September, and his opponent's Liberal Party has dominated in the polls. His party recently voted down former Prime Minister Julia Gillard who was widely unpopular and put Rudd in her place to court favor with voters before time runs out. The new law, which Rudd's government delivered, could also play well with more conservative Australian voters and garner Rudd's party more votes. Riots over . Back on Nauru, things have calmed down. Authorities have moved the asylum seekers to an alternative location and have set up tented temporary housing. The flames spared the kitchen, so there is food to go around for the \"transferees.\" And the rioters may face legal consequences for their actions, Australia's immigration minister said. They could wander from the refugee camp to jail. \"The sort of crimes that appear to be committed are serious -- with prison sentences,\" Tony Burke said. But they have returned to the camp. There is no place else for them to go on the tiny island, or much of anywhere else. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat reported from Atlanta; Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- One of the most powerful experiences in life is to have deep, meaningful connection. Without it we are empty. Each message I received about my struggle with psoriasis was a new connection that brought with it a tapestry of fulfillment, gratitude and inspiration for me. Thank you. Many of you have asked me about diet. For me, it was, the most long-term solution to heal my severe psoriasis then, requiring the toughest self-discipline and a team of cheerleaders. Here's what I did, with what I learned at the clinic in South Africa, and my mother, Yasmin's help. Mum and I also used the book \"Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative\" by Dr. John O.A. Pagano to help explain diet in more detail and the science of natural healing. Stuff I did not eat: Sugar, coffee, tea, soda, red meat (except for lamb), shellfish, oranges (I had very little citrus at all), \"hot\" spices, pumpkin, onions, garlic, tomato, mushrooms, eggplant, peppers, chili, paprika, cheese, white rice, white flour, bread, eggs, butter, cookies, chocolate, alcohol, tobacco, cranberries, blueberries, plums, strawberries, cream, lentils, peas, white potatoes, yeast. Stuff I could eat: Brown rice or wild rice, plain chicken or lamb, honey, apple, melon, banana, leafy green salads (no dressing), plain low-fat yogurt, celery, spinach, broccoli, corn, sweet potato pear, papaya, apricot, grilled fish, turkey, wholegrain muffin or bagel, bran, almonds, low-fat milk, wholegrain pasta. Loads of water. Mum and I devised some menus like this: . Breakfast: Lemon in hot water, high fiber cereals/bran and milk, papaya, low fat yogurt, chamomile tea, occasional eggs. Lunch and dinner: Stir-fry vegetables (celery, carrots, French beans, corn, cabbage, broccoli) in one desert spoon of olive oil along with fresh herbs, like basil, rosemary, oregano and fresh coriander, salt and pepper to taste. Chopped nuts. Apricots, honey; . Grilled lamb with salt, pepper and honey -- white sauce over it, (made with wholewheat flour, milk and seasoning). Plain grilled chicken with olive oil, salt and pepper plus honey; fresh chicken soup; grilled turkey breast; roasted duck (white meat only); wholegrain pasta in white sauce; grilled fish (trout or sole or mackerel); vegetable lasagna. All foods served with leafy green salads and with vegetable sides such as asparagus with low fat margarine, steamed cauliflower with beans, broccoli and carrots, corn or sweet potato. Sweet tooth: Baked bananas, stewed apple or pear, plain low fat yogurt with fruit, pomegranate, dates, cantaloupe, fruit salad, whole grain, apricots and prunes. Drinks: Diluted apple juice, melon juice, low fat milk, and water. Munchies: Carrots, salad, pear, apple, avocado, sunflower seeds, Barvita biscuits, snack bars that are oatmeal (no preservatives or coloring or flavoring). Vitamins: B12, CoQ10, Folic acid, Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin D . Exercise: I worked out for at least 1-2 hours a day. Steam: I drank two liters of cooled American yellow saffron tea while sweating in the steam room for at least 30-60 minutes a day. I would go in and out repeatedly so-as not to overheat. I would rest and eat bananas afterwards (which contain potassium). Meditation: At the clinic in South Africa, I learned how to do deep relaxation and creative visualization. Three times a day I lay on the floor of my bedroom for at least 30 minutes and meditated. I imagined myself windsurfing in a bikini with the naked sun on my clear skin. I imagined making a deal with my psoriasis, I would maintain the diet, and it, in turn would go away. I visualized that all the time. I used naturally based topical creams from the Meyer Zall clinic to help sooth my skin. The clinic is now closed. Remission . This worked for me back then and put me in remission for about 10 years, where I could eat anything I wanted and live completely normally. I have suffered recently from significant flare-ups that are stress induced (need to handle stress better ...). I needed a \"quick fix\" and first was on Enbrel injections, then Methotrexate and now Humira, a biologic drug, which is currently helping. There is clearly a place for medication like this in healing, but my experience with diet forces me to believe that is a longer term, side effect-free solution. There is much debate in the value of food: which are immune boosters, what is more or less acidic, what is toxic for certain illnesses, is gluten-free the way to go; can food only provide cures? There is no one size fits all. The only universal truth in all this, for me, is maintaining a positive attitude no matter how hard it is, with the love and support of friends and family. Once again, thank you. For more information on psoriasis, Verjee suggests visiting the National Psoriasis Foundation (U.S), Psoriasis Association (UK) or Africa Psoriasis Organization (Kenya). Medical advice is that sufferers work with their doctors to establish a treatment plan.

        "article": "Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is confident his side can beat Arsenal this weekend to get their title challenge back on course. City lost their last game before the international break 1-0 to Stoke, and want to send a strong message to their title rivals by beating Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. And Dzeko believes his side can take the initiative against a club he believes can challenge for the title. Title challenge: Dzeko knows that there will be several teams hoping to knock City off top spot . Best year: Dzeko (right) during City's trophy parade, after a season which he described as his best yet . '[The Arsenal game] will be difficult but I'm an optimist,' he told the Manchester City official website. 'This season Chelsea might be the most serious challenger but we mustn't ignore Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, or [Manchester] United, who will certainly be much stronger than last year. After all, everyone has got stronger and everyone wants to be first.' Dzeko was a key part of City's title winning squad last season, and committed to a new four-year contract over the summer. 'The past season was one of the best in my career, and in the end we reached the title of champions of England, the second in the past three seasons,' the 28-year old said. Agonising: Manuel Pellegrini's side were not at their best in the narrow defeat to Stoke last week . Shooting boots: Dzeko will want to rediscover his form against Arsenal, having not yet scored this season . 'We succeeded in winning the Capital One Cup and I am really happy how everything played out in the past season, both for the club and for myself. 'As far as the contract, in general I had no dilemma around an extension. 'I am happy at City, the manager believes in me, which is certainly important, and I give my all on the pitch and altogether it means quite a lot to me, because City is a club with great ambitions and I easily decided to stay put.'",

Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently a boiling 109F, does not use air-conditioning even though he has got it in his home. Mr Cox, 54, says he saves money and the environment by keeping the air-conditioning switched off - and he rarely breaks into a sweat. Cool: Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently 109F, does not use air-conditioning at the home he shares with his wife even though they've got it . Mr Cox and his wife, Priti, use tricks in their home taught to them by older generations that help them to avoid overheating, reported ABC News. Mr Cox grew up without air-conditioning in Georgia and claims people have lost the social interaction on summer evenings they had in the past. \u2018You'd see kids playing up and down the streets, people visiting one another on their front porches,\u2019 he told ABC News. \u2018Now the only sounds you hear are compressors running. Neighbourhoods look like they've been evacuated.\u2019 More than 140 million Americans across 32 states are currently under heat advisories as the U.S. experiences a widespread heatwave. But agricultural scientist and author Mr Cox claims that by turning on your air-conditioning you\u2019re actually making things worse. Not in my house: Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it . \u2018The headline irony here is that the hotter it gets in summer, the more we're using our a/c,\u2019 he told ABC News. \u2018The more we're doing that, the greater the emissions from power plants and probability we'll have even more intense heat waves in the future.\u2019 He has already put forward this view in a piece for the Washington Post last July, which resulted in a postbag of hate mail and even death threats. Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it. The average U.S. household spends more than $275 per year on air-conditioning although local costs vary significantly. He also believes there would be a fall in obesity if children and adults were to spend more time outdoors and be more active. Mr Cox claims a Japanese study found air conditioning cuts down on cortisol production by the adrenal glands, which gets you out of bed.",

The Sydney born photographer has an impressive collection of self portraits with the rich and famous - having met the likes of Michael Jackson, Michael Hutchence, Kylie Minogue, Audrey Hepburn and Oprah Winfrey. But after 25 years on the job, he's calling it quits. Almost famous: Richard Simpkin has brushed shoulders with celebrities for 25 years including the king of pop Michael Jackson in 1996 . 'It's been a lot of fun and a great adventure but I'm glad I don't have to do it anymore,' he said. 'Celebrities today are not what they used to be. I think they're more like throw away plastics now. 'The word celebrity has lost its value and it's cheapened over the years.' It all started when 15-year-old Simpkin's friend showed him photo of her father with John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1989. 'I went and bought myself a camera straight away and knew I was onto something,' he said. 'From then on, I got a 20 year head start from everyone else and taking photos with these big names.' The Sydneysider first met leader singer of INXS Michael Hutchence (left) in 1989 and remained friends until his tragic death in 1997. Also pictured is Kylie Minogue, who once dated Hutchence . Katy Perry takes a photo of herself and Richard in 2012 . The young photographer posed with actress Audrey Hepburn during her visit to Sydney in 1991 as an ambassador for UNICEF . The star tracker has outlived some of his subjects including South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela . The star snapper is pictured with television personality Oprah Winfrey in 2010 . Simpkin said he felt that last year was the right time for him to stop his hobby-turned-profession. 'I lost count many years ago,' he said. 'I think I stopped counting after 2000.' The star snapper reminisced on some of the most memorable moments and said Michael Jackson was one of his best. Having said that, the 40-year-old is also getting a taste of fame. 'It's come full circle now,' he said. 'People are now asking for my photo and just the other day I look about 150 selfies with the general public after a talk show.' His exhibition, Richard and Famous is at Westfield shopping centre in Bondi Junction until May 22.

Extraordinary footage of a group of teenagers scaling one of the highest man-made structures in Russia without any safety equipment has appeared on the internet. In a video posted on YouTube, a trio of 'skywalkers' can be seen taking photographs from the top of the 1,000ft high Russky Island Bridge, located near Vladivostok in the east of the country. The three minute clip shows the group climbing ladders hand over hand and traversing walkways with nothing but water visible far below. Don't look down: The daredevil teens film themselves 1,000ft above the Eastern Bosphorus near Vladivostok . Some view: The panoramic vista enjoyed by the youths from the top of the Russky Island Bridge . Long way down: The view looking down at the Eastern Bosphorus from the top of the Russky Island Bridge . At one point, the camera pans to show two beaming members of the group who give V-signs to celebrate reaching the top of the structure. Then, amazingly, one of the teens can be seen fearlessly stepping over the parapet of one walkway and dangling his foot over the precipice. He later follows this up by giving one of his friends a high-five. Head for heights: The Russian teens hang on tightly as they traverse a walkway 1,000ft up . Daredevils: One of the men poses for the camera with Russky Island visible behind him . Photo opportunity: A young man captures his aerial exploits on camera - note the lack of safety equipment . Highway: The Russky Island bridge, which will carry traffic between the island and Vladivostok, is expected to open in September 2012 . The daredevil stunt echoes a similar climb in September, when four youngsters filmed themselves scaling the Moskovskyi Bridge in Kiev, Ukraine, and uploaded the footage to YouTube. The Russky Island Bridge will be the the world's largest cable-stayed bridge when it opens to the public in September. The 1,885m long structure will carry four lanes of traffic - two in each direction - over the eastern Bosphorus strait which separates Vladivostok from Russky Island.",

        "article": "Tokyo (CNN) -- A power company apologized Saturday and said the exposure of three workers at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant to highly radioactive water might have been avoided with better communication. The Thursday incident has spurred questions about the source of the radioactive contamination in water, its potential to taint seawater nearby and the prospect it might be evidence of a leak in at least one of the facility's six reactor cores. It also prompted further criticism of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., which runs the plant, and how well it is safeguarding the nearly 500 people working to prevent more emission of potentially cancerous radioactive materials about two weeks after a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami rocked the facility. On March 24, three workers laying electrical cable in the turbine building of the No. 3 reactor stepped in tainted water, exposing themselves to high levels of radiation. Two suffered direct exposure on their skin. Hideyuki Koyama, the company's associate director, said pooled water had been discovered in the basement of the No. 1 reactor six days earlier, but a sample wasn't taken for analysis until the 24th, after the workers were exposed. The company started draining the water from the No. 1 reactor that evening and has continued draining it ever since, he said. Plans are also in the works to drain water from the No. 2 and No. 3 reactors. Such incidents threatened to undermine the public's trust in Tokyo Electric, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. He added the Japanese government \"would like to give stronger instructions\" to the company that it fully disclose as much information as possible about conditions at the plant. \"Every piece of information must be provided accurately and swiftly\" to Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency, Edano said. \"Without this communication, it's very difficult for the government to (establish) proper safety measures.\" As important, the chief secretary said, was the need for Tokyo Electric to be upfront with the Japanese -- millions of whom get power from the company and millions more of whom have been affected by radioactive emissions stemming from the crisis. \"We need to be sure that (Tokyo Electric) isn't going to act in a way that will create distrust,\" Edano said. Koyama told reporters that radiation alarms went off while the three men were working, but they continued with their mission for 40 to 50 minutes after assuming it was a false alarm. Later, they were hospitalized after it was determined they had been exposed to 173 to 181 millisieverts of radiation -- two of them with direct exposure on their skin. By comparison, a person in an industrialized country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year, though Japan's health ministry has said that those working directly to avert the nuclear crisis could be exposed to as much as 250 millisieverts before they must leave the site. Hours before the apology, a Tokyo Electric official told reporters that water samples from the turbine buildings for the No. 1 and 2 reactors had high levels of radiation, though not as high as in the basement of the No. 3 building. Later Saturday, Tokyo Electric amended its assessment of the level of radiation in water in the No. 1 building, saying it was not nearly as dangerous as first reported. The water radiation levels were 60 millisieverts per hour -- compared to 200, as had been stated earlier -- while atmospheric radiation was 25 millisieverts per hour. The issue of possible leakage of such material gained urgency Saturday after Japan's nuclear and industrial safety agency reported the amount of radioactive iodine in seawater recorded 330 meters (361 yards) from the plant was 1,250 times above normal. A Tokyo Electric official speculated water runoff or leakage from the turbine buildings may have caused the sudden increase, though he said other factors might have contributed as well. Friday, Hidehiko Nishiyama of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said the contaminated water suggests \"some sort of leakage\" from the No. 3 reactor's core -- signaling a possible breach of the containment vessel that houses the core. These developments come despite indications from the International Atomic Energy Agency that the level of airborne radiation around the plant, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, \"continues to decrease.\" Tokyo Electric reported on its website that at 7 a.m. Saturday, radiation at the plant's main gate was 0.219 millisieverts per hour -- a fraction of the 400 millisieverts per hour measured between Units 3 and 4 on March 15. The measurements are a significant drop from readings taken at the same gate over the past week. The presence of highly radioactive water in buildings at reactors Nos. 1, 2 and 3 has halted some efforts to curb the release of further emissions. Still, others continued and there have been recent signs of progress. \"We can comfortably say that we are taking measures so that the situation has not deteriorated,\" Edano said. \"We've been able to take some steps forward. But still, vigilance is required.\" Fresh water was being pumped Saturday at reactors 1, 2 and 3. That replaced the seawater that had previously been used, with the aim of fresh water being simultaneously to cool down nuclear fuel and also flush out accumulating salt that might hinder the reactors' existing cooling systems. The No. 3 reactor has been of particular concern, experts have said, because it is the only one to use a combination of uranium and plutonium fuel, called MOX, considered more dangerous than the pure uranium fuel used in other reactors. The Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry trade group that is tracking official accounts of the effort at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, said the pressure of the No. 3 reactor's containment vessel has been upgraded to \"stable.\" Whereas the group had stated Friday that damage was suspected in the reactor, on Saturday its assessment changed to \"unknown\" -- a further acknowledgment of uncertainty as to whether the contaminated water was the result of a leak in the nuclear reactor core or had some other cause. Efforts also continue at the No. 4, 5 and 6 reactors -- each of which has less pronounced concerns because the units were on scheduled outages when the quake struck. None of these three units had nuclear fuel inside their reactors, though efforts are ongoing to control temperatures inside the spent fuel pools. CNN's Jennifer Rizzo contributed to this report .",

'Take a moment to remember #Pearlharbor with us,' read the tweet last Friday night. Pearl Harbor commemorates the death of 2,386 Americans and is a national tragedy. This photo of a smililing pasta-O holding an American flag left many saying, 'oh no' The company's attempt to sell SpaghettiOs with a smile on a tragic remembrance got some twitter users talking. 'Hope nobody minds if I chose to remember Pearl Harbor and forever forget @SpaghettiOs. #TastelessCorporation,' said twitter user simply Laura. 'I can't wait for the official @spaghettiOs 9/11 tweet,' said Suzan Eraslan. '@SpaghettiOs maybe sit out the next couple plays,' said Andy Levy. Once SpaghettiOs caught wind of the fact that they offended the blogosphere, they issued a formal apology on December 7. 'We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day. We meant to pay respect, not to offend.' Marketingland.com reported that the offensive tweet got over 3,000 retweets but not out of popularity, rather out of disgust. SpaghettiOs issued a formal apology on December 7 and deleted their original posting . They have since deleted their original posting. According to thinkprogress.org,this is not the first time corporations have tried to use public holidays to promote their brand--even if it's considered inappropriate. On Veterans' Day, the movie Man of Steel tweeted out a picture of their movie along with a 'thank the troops message.' The brand Kenneth Cole tweeted during the revolutionary uprise in Egypt and said, 'Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new Spring collection is available online. SpaghettiOs which is an American brand under the umbrella company Campbell's Soup features circular pasta covered in a cheese and tomato sauce. It comes in a can and is marketed to parents as 'less messy' than regular pasta. If only the same thing could be said about their 'messy' advertising practices.",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- With the World Cup in 2014, the Olympics two years later and large discoveries of oil boosting the economy, Brazilians could be excused for looking at the world through rose-tinted glasses. The world's party country -- home to samba dance and Carnival -- is enjoying an economic cocktail of low unemployment and easy consumer credit, propelling many Brazilians into the country's burgeoning middle class. But while tens of millions of people have been hauled out of poverty, questions are being raised around the risks of a consumer-driven boom. In the last decade, effective anti-poverty policies such as \"Bolsa Familia\" -- translated as Family Bag -- introduced by former President Lula and carried on by incumbent Dilma Rousseff, have helped transform Brazil's workforce and increase the minimum wage. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . \"Brazil used to be one of the most unequal countries in the world,\" Naercio Mezenes Filho, professor of economics at Brazillian business school, Insper, told CNN. He added: \"Unskilled labor is in short supply right now because the youngest have remained in school compared to the past.\" Brazil -- with a population of 190 million people scattered across its Atlantic coast -- is famed for its billionaire tycoons like mining magnate Eike Batista or banker Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil's richest man. Read more: Rising Brazil tackles immigration question . And while wealth disparity remains an issue in Latin America's largest economy, Brazil is beginning to see a change in the tide, according to Jens Arnold, head of the Brazil desk at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He told CNN that Brazil's population is seeing a new trend as some of the poorest 10% in the country shake off poverty. Read more: Building on 'BRICS': The next emerging economies . Arnold said: \"More people have access to better paying jobs... [and] living standards are coming up, particularly for those who are below the poverty line.\" Could the boom bust? Many Brazilians who once inhabited the gang-ridden shanty towns, known as favelas, now have the disposable income to shop for aspirational products, from cars to DVD players. And that's not all. Robust and highly-capitalized banks are offering easy lines of credit to Brazilian consumers who find themselves in regular employment. Read more: Is Brazil ready to take sporting center stage? Edmund Amann, senior lecturer in social sciences at Manchester University, told CNN that Brazil's economy is experiencing a consumer-borrowing model of growth. \"There's been quite a surge in domestic consumption,\" he said. \"That has centered on consumer durables, not least automobiles,\" Amann added. Store cards are the most popular way to shop in Brazil, allowing customers to pay for goods in regular installments rather than meeting the full price up front. A study by McKinsey & Company in 2012 showed that 40% of consumers said they shop more in stores that extend credit, six times more than the U.S. data from the Central Bank of Brazil in 2009 indicated that use of retail cards increased over 100% from 2004 to 2008. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . Amann said although the increase in household debt is unlikely to cause a bubble, there is a chance investors could be spooked with the crisis in Europe and the U.S. still causing global pain. But Amann noted Brazil's economy is protected by a buoyant commodity market and said of consumer appetite: \"Financial education is important... for many people, this will be their first experience of a formal financial arrangement where they have a bank account and have access to lending.\" While Naercio believes inflation risk -- currently at 6.5% in Brazil -- is one of the biggest threats to Brazil, with easy lending from public-sector banks hitting consumers if the economy fails to grow. However, \"I don't think there is any chance we will see what happened in the U.S. and Europe in the property crash,\" he said. A bright future . In 2001 Brazil was included in the term BRIC, an acronym coined by then-Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill, to describe the next big emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Brazil -- the world's sixth largest economy -- is beginning to see its mining and commodities sectors bear fruit, particularly oil and iron ore. And despite Brazil's disappointing economic data for the last two years relative to its high-growth brethren, Arnold believes Brazil has a bright future ahead. He said: \"We expect this to come back to potential growth rates and we expect a recovery to be taking place in this year.\" Amman told CNN he was \"no doomsayer\" on the Brazilian economy but added that the country needed to move to a \"Chinese model\" of investment to kick-start growth. Amann said: \"The biggest single risk the economy faces is a collapse on commodity prices... we probably are approaching the limit of a consumer borrowing based growth model.\"",

        "article": "Pupils at one secondary school in Britain will undergo fitness training every day in an effort to tackle childhood obesity. Students will be taught to squat when picking up a football and lunge when tying up shoelaces so that a positive relationship with exercise is fostered - even in children who don't like sport. Ashwell Academy, in Hull, East Yorkshire, will become the first to introduce a specially-designed anti-obesity programme into its curriculum. Pupils at one British secondary school will undergo fitness training every day as part of a new independent programme which aims to tackle childhood obesity . From January next year, students will spend a total of three and a half hours per week doing some form of physical exercise - 75 per cent more than the national average. The frequency of PE lessons will increase from one per week to daily activities with pupils performing exercises such as squats, press-ups, lunges and burpees. Pupils who buy school dinners will also be encouraged to plump for a healthier option that contains less fat, salt and additives in an attempt to tackle Britain's \u00a35.1 billion epidemic. The news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity. They warned that an entire generation will be 'destroyed' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken. In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons. Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football. This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip. They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces. The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance. This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness. Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school. Almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. Today's independent  initiative to introduce daily exercise in schools, called the Schools and National Anti-Obesity Program (SNAP), will be incorporated into the Academy's curriculum on January 6, 2015, and will run for a trial period of six weeks. If this is a success then the program will continue until 2018. Its aim - to fight childhood obesity and support pupils' wellbeing by giving them a 'positive and purposeful experience' with exercise - is nothing new. But unlike existing schemes, SNAP is designed to be integrated into the curriculum, rather than run in conjunction with it. If the trial at Ashwell Academy is successful, SNAP looks set to roll out in schools across the UK next year. Other schools, including Headington, an exclusive girl's school in Oxford, and Longhill Primary School in Hull, East Yorks., have already expressed an interest. Mike Birkinshaw, headteacher at Ashwell Academy, said: 'We are keen to introduce a better standard of physical education into our curriculum while being aware that our students' health and wellbeing generally should also remain a priority. 'We have already introduced healthier lunch options to tackle obesity, but it isn't enough by itself. 'Children need to be more active as inactivity results in obesity and other health issues that can continue into adulthood. 'As a school we feel that we have a duty of care to do all we can to safeguard our pupils against the growing problem of childhood obesity and believe that SNAP will align perfectly with our aims.' According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), childhood obesity is one of the most 'serious public health challenges of the 21st Century'. Pupils who buy school dinners will be encouraged to go for healthier options with less fat, salt and additives . In the UK, almost a third of 10 to 11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4 to 5 year olds are either obese or overweight, according to figures from the National Child Measurement Programme 2012/13. But despite obesity being largely preventable, SNAP's creator, Daniel Fallon says schools have been 'generally unaware' of the 'straightforward' measures that can be put in place to curb it at a grassroots level. Mr Fallon, a recently retired Navy Petty Officer, drew on his 13 years as a fitness instructor and clinical exercise specialist to create a program specifically designed for schools. It has been devised with a view of helping teachers to incorporate simple but more structured fitness training into and around traditional, curriculum-based PE lessons. The news comes after doctors recently called for an emergency taskforce to be set up to tackle childhood obesity. They warned that an entire generation will be 'destroyed' by a diet of junk food and sugary drinks unless urgent action is taken. In an open letter to the Chief Medical Officer for England sent in September, Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and 11 partner organisations said a national Child Obesity Action Group (COAG) should be formed as 'a matter of urgency'. Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school. 18.9 per cent of children in Year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight. Of the children in Reception aged four to five, latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight. In total almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese. Pupils are taught to squat, for example, and encouraged to do so when picking-up a football. This is more beneficial to the leg and back muscles than simply bending-over from the hip. They are also taught to twist correctly when playing netball, and to lunge when tying their shoelaces. The exercises are said to be particularly effective because they are also used everyday school life - when picking up a pen, for instance. This means that youngsters who do not have an active interest in sport or PE still benefit from basic fitness. SNAP - described as a world first - is sold on licence, and affiliate schools receive training workshops for teachers and teaching assistants, instructional handbooks, illustrated text books for students, and video support. Schools are then free to integrate SNAP's recommendations as they see fit. Hull's Ashwell Academy, which specialises in behavioural difficulties, is the first school to sign up to carry out SNAP. According to NHS figures, 19 per cent of children in East Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire are obese or 'dangerously overweight'. Headteacher Mike Birkinshaw added: 'SNAP offers a stimulating and fun way to increase the frequency - and, by a small margin, the length - of physical education classes and engage with young people regardless of whether they are into sports or not. 'We look forward to trialling the programme in January 2015 and based on the pupil feedback and results, incorporating it into our curriculum on a long-term basis.' Mr Fallon, SNAP's creator, completed three tours of duty in the Middle East, Africa and Mediterranean before retiring from the Navy  last month. He said: 'It is a widely reported fact that there is concern about the state of PE in schools, however there has not been a credible and cost-effective alternative to existing curriculum guidelines. 'SNAP isn't about transforming schools into boot camps, but rather a method of introducing simple and straightforward exercises into school's current PE lessons.' Latest figures show many children are already obese by the time they reach secondary school.\u00a0In total, almost a third of 10 to 11-year-olds and more than a fifth of four to five-year-olds were overweight or obese .",

        "article": "The killing of toddler Mikaeel Kular could 'not have been predicted' by social and health service workers who visited his family in the months leading up to his death, a review has found. His mother, Rosdeep Adekoya, beat her three-year-old son to death before stuffing his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods in Kircaldy, Fife, in January last year. His death came just six months after he was returned to Adekoya's care following more than a year with foster carers. Social workers also visited the family a number of times over two years. But a review into whether the social care teams involved with the family could or should have foreseen the circumstances of his death has concluded it 'could not have been predicted'. Victim:\u00a0The killing of toddler Mikaeel Kular (left) by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) could 'not have been predicted' by social and health service workers who visited his family in the months leading up to his death . Adekoya, then 34, beat Mikaeel for being sick and left him to die in agony over three days. She then told police her child had wandered off, sparking a major two-day search operation involving emergency services and hundreds of volunteers. Adekoya eventually led officers to the body, which she hid near her sister's house. She was jailed for 11 years last August after pleading guilty to\u00a0culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. In the wake of the tragedy, the Fife and Edinburgh Child Protection Committees commissioned an independent significant case review to establish whether the care teams could have predicted the killing is published. A summary of the review, published today, concluded that Adekoya's behaviour towards her son was 'unprecedented and out of character' and that the killing 'could not have been predicted', even though a number of concerns had been raised and the toddler had spent time in care. February 2012 - July 2012\u00a0Fife social work and NHS Fife health visiting services carry out a number of joint home visits after concerns are raised over the children's welfare . July 2012 Mikaeel is taken into care after Adekoya left he and her  other children unattended . August 2013\u00a0Children's Hearing takes place and Mikaeel is returned to his mother's care . August 2013 January 2014 The family is visited five times by Fife social workers  and twice by an Edinburgh health visitor . January 2014 Adekoya, then 34, beat Mikaeel for being sick and left him to die in agony over three days . August 2014\u00a0 Adekoya is jailed for 11 years after pleading guilty to culpable homicide and a second charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice . Today Independent significant case review to establish whether the care teams could have predicted the killing is published . Between February 2012 and July 2012, Fife social work and NHS Fife health visiting services carried out a number of joint home visits after concerns were twice raised. Mikaeel, referred to in the report as MK, was taken into care in July 2012 after Adekoya left he and her other children unattended. He remained with foster carers until August 2013, while social workers were waiting for a Children's Hearing before returning the boy to his mother. The report published today noted that while waiting for the hearing, contact arrangements were not increased. The review team felt that this should have been undertaken and used as an opportunity to test out and monitor his mother's ability to manage her parenting responsibilities. After Mikaeel was returned to his mother, the family was visited five times by Fife social workers and twice by the Edinburgh health visitors. The teams found no factors that suggested a level of risk that required intervention. The review concluded that 'the circumstances that led to MK's death could not have been predicted'. The report identified examples of good practice but also identified 13 areas for future learning and action for NHS Fife, Fife social work services and other organisations including the Scottish Government. Steve Grimmond, chair of the joint Chief Officers' Group of Fife and Edinburgh, which agreed the remit of the review, said: 'Social workers and health professionals involved in the case have been greatly affected by this tragedy. Concern: Adekoya told police her child had wandered off, sparking a major two-day search operation involving emergency services and hundreds of volunteers (pictured in January last year) 'They care very deeply about what they do and the people they support. 'The report acknowledges the challenges involved for staff going through periods of organisational change while carrying heavy caseloads. 'All agencies will consider how we can improve support to staff at these times and make sure robust processes are in place to review and assess the impact of change within our organisations. 'The report does make a number of recommendations around the sharing and management of information. We're keen to support this in whatever way we can. Killer: Adekoya, pictured, was jailed for 11 years last August after pleading guilty to culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice . 'Finally, we commissioned an independent significant case review to make sure we learn from this case. 'We fully accept the report's findings and we are taking every opportunity to improve and strengthen our practices.' The full report is not being published as it contains detailed, personal and private information, although a summary has been released. Professor Scott McLean, NHS Fife executive lead for children's services, said: 'NHS Fife accepts today's independent report findings in full. 'The report highlights that professionals communicated well with each other and worked collaboratively to care for Mikaeel and his family. 'It clearly states that there is no evidence that health or other professionals could have predicted the tragic death of Mikaeel. 'We are committed to learning from this case and further strengthening areas of practice.' A Scottish Government spokesman said: 'The sudden, un-natural death of any child is a tragedy and the untimely death of Mikaeel Kular continues to reverberate across Scotland and in particular, the communities in Fife and Edinburgh where he lived. 'The Scottish Government therefore welcomes the urgency with which this significant case review was undertaken and its speedy conclusion and focused actions, which we are sure will now be considered and acted upon by all the appropriate agencies timeously. 'We accept the recommendation directed at the Scottish Government and we will consider the implications of the report very carefully. 'We are currently consulting on guidance and secondary legislation accompanying the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act which will help meet the recommendation. 'The Scottish Government takes seriously its responsibilities in relation to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all of Scotland's children, including those who are most vulnerable and at risk of harm. 'We have worked, and will continue to work with, partners and through parliament to strengthen how statutory agencies and children's services work together to identify and respond early to concerns about a child's safety or wellbeing, including most recently through the Children & Young People (Scotland) Act.'",

        "article": "Nearly two years after tech blogs screamed \"Antennagate!\" over problems with the iPhone 4's reception, owners will be getting a little pocket change for their troubles. Apple over the weekend settled a class-action lawsuit filed about the issue, promising to pay $15 or give a free case to everyone in the United States who bought one of the wildly popular phones. Released in June 2010, the slimmer reworking of Apple's smartphone became a huge seller. But soon after it went on sale, some owners began complaining that their phone frequently dropped voice calls. The culprit, it was ultimately determined, was the antenna, which is wrapped in a band around the phone's edge to help create its slim form. Using what became known as the \"death grip,\" (i.e. holding the phone at a certain spot) caused reception to suffer or cut out entirely. \"This settlement relates to a small number of customers who indicated that they experienced antenna or reception issues with their iPhone 4, and didn't want to take advantage of a free case from Apple when it was being offered in 2010,\" Apple told CNET in a written statement. However, Ira Rothken, a lead attorney in the case, said more than 21 million iPhone 4 owners were eligible for the payout. The free case offer lasted for three months. Apple had initially ignored the complaints, then dismissed them, then called a rare press conference at which then-CEO Steve Jobs announced the offer, while claiming the problem was just as bad on other companies' phones. A bumper or other protective case on the phone eliminates, or at least greatly reduces, the problem. Apple's new iPhone 4S, released in October, has not shown a similar problem. \"We believe that the Apple iPhone 4 settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable,\" Rothken told CNET. \"We believe that it allows members of the class to choose, and they can get $15 of cash or a bumper, so we believe that type of choice is proportional to the circumstances.\" Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Multiple lawsuits had been merged into one in the case. Plaintiffs claimed that Apple had been misleading in its communication with customers about the problem. Rothken first noted \"preliminary approval\" of the settlement late Friday on Twitter. Under the settlement, eligible customers should get an e-mail from Apple some time in April. They'll then have 120 days to apply for the $15. A website, iPhone4Settlement.com, has been set up but had not yet been activated as of Monday morning.",

        "article": "Millions of Indonesians have watched on television exactly how Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be executed on 'Death Island'. Chilling video has emerged of the mobile paramilitary brigade called Brimob in firing practice ahead of the last round of executions on Nusa Kambangan, where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shifted 72 hours ahead of their deaths by firing squad. This comes as coffins arrived at a Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusa Kambangan, where a local Indonesian caretaker was pictured preparing four caskets in preparation for the executions. Scroll down for video . Hooded figure: Indonesia's Channel 1 recreated the method of execution by firing squad which was used to kill six foreigners on Nusa Kambangan last month using the hooded figure (pictured) to represent the prisoner. It is the same method that will be used on Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Target practice: These members of the Brimob paramilitary group practice firing at targets ahead of last months execution on 'Death Island'. The same group will carry out the executions of Chan and Sukumaran . Local Indonesian caretaker Suhendro Putro  prepares four caskets allocated to the scheduled executions on Nusa Kambangan, known as 'Death Island' More coffins are understood to be on their way to the pictured Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest port to 'Death Island' Bali Police Chief A.J. Benny Mokalu on Wednesday confirmed the procedures that will lead to the executions. The condemned Australian pair would be taken from Bali's Kerobokan prison to Ngurah Rai airport during the night and flown 900 kilometres west to Cilacap, in central Java, then transferred by boat to Nusa Kambangan. Exactly when this will take place is still unknown. Indonesian officials have repeatedly rejected appeals from the condemned men's lawyers and the Australian government to stay the executions of Chan and Sukumaran, who were convicted on heroin trafficking charges in 2006. The footage of the execution practice round was aired on television on January 17 to demonstrate to Indonesian viewers just what would take place when five foreign drug traffickers were executed the following day. Those executions, of nationals from Brazill, the Netherlands, Malawi, Vietnam and one Indonesian, were the first since President Joko Widodo came to power last October. A tough stance on drug criminals was part of his campaign, and he has been uncompromising about using the death penalty despite pleas from foreign governments and rights activists. The video shows  the Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles aiming loud volleys of fire repeatedly at bullseye targets. Even more horrifying is the spooky step-by-step recreation by\u00a0Channel 1 Indonesia\u00a0of the execution, using a white figure with its arms tied behind the back and a black hood over its head to represent the condemned man. Bali's Police Chief A.J. Benny Mokalu confirmed on Wednesday the condemned pair Sukumaran (left) and Chan (right) will be taken from Kerobokan prison to Ngurah Rai airport during the night and flown 900km west to Cilacap in central Java and transferred by boat to Nusa Kambangan . Death men: This eerie recreation of how the firing squad, which Channel 1 Indonesia represented with nine scary looking robotic figures, lines up to carry out the execution . The wives of convicted Indonesian terrorists imprisoned on the island where Australians Chan and Sukumaran are due to be executed visited their husbands the facility this week . The mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will execute the two Australians is pictured in firing practice last month before they executed five foreign drug traffickers on Nusa Kambangan Island . In the recreation, the firing squad is represented by a row of toy or robotic looking figures. The television report also lists a 27 point manifesto about how the execution will proceed, including the execution 'commander' raising a sword 'as a symbol for the firing squad to aim at the heart of the convict'. Points 24 and 25 give specific instructions for doctors to check the condition of the convict immediately after the shooting, 'and if the doctor thinks that the convict is still showing signs of life ... the firing squad commander must put a pistol to the temple just above the ear of the convict' and finish the job. Some of the last words the men being executed will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian - shouted by the firing squad commander before three live rounds and nine blanks are loaded into the twelve rifles of the firing squad shooters. Part of the process includes clergy attending to 'give offenders a last chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes' before they are shot. Brimob's snipers reload their rifles before continuing their target practice in a loud volley of fire . The shooters accurately aimed at the bullseye targets on the firing range in Java, Indonesia . The strikers or snipers put on a display for Indonesia's TV 1 station, which was broadcast to millions of Indonesian viewers the day before last month;s round of executions . The high walls topped with razor wire at the entrance to Pusir Putih prison, one of six correctional facilities on Nusa Kambangan, Indonesia's 'Alcatraz' in central Java . The snipers fired repeatedly at targets in January before they executed five foreign drug traffickers. Indonesia has a precise 27 point manifesto for how the executions are carried out . 1. Convict is given  clean, simple, and white clothing before being taken to a place or location of the implementation of the death penalty . 2. When brought to the place or location of the implementation of the death penalty, the convict can be accompanied by a member of the clergy . 3. The support team is ready at the appointed place two (2) hours before the time of execution of the death penalty . 4. Team shooters have been gathered in preparation at the location of the implementation of the death penalty, one (1) hour prior . 5. Team shooter sets the position and puts the 12 (twelve) rifles in front of the pole position of the implementation of the death penalty at a distance of five (5) meters up to ten (10) feet and back to the prep area . 6. Execution commander  reports his team's readiness to prosecutors executor by saying 'report execution of the death penalty is ready' 7. Execution attorney conducts a final check of death row and the weapons used for the implementation of the death penalty . 8. After the inspection is completed, the prosecutor orders the  executing commander calls out 'execute' and then  repeats the utterance 'execute' 9. The execution commander orders the firing squad commander to fill and lock arms ammunition into twelve (12) rifles with three (3) rounds of live ammunition and nine (9) roundsof blanks . 10. The prosecutor orders the commander of the execution squad  to bring the convicted man to a position shooting and release his handcuffs and tie his hands and feet to a pillar in a standing, sitting, or kneeling position, unless otherwise specified by the prosecutor . 11. The offender is given a last chance to calm down a maximum of 3 (three) minutes, accompanied by a clergy member . 12. The commander team places a black cloth over the eyes of the covnicted man, unless the convict refuses . 13. Doctors place a black mark on the convict's clothes right over the heart as the place to shoot at. Then the doctor withdraws . 14. The commander reports to the execution prosecutor that the convicted person is ready to receive the death penalty . 15. The execution prosecutor gives the sign/gesture to the commander to begin immediately implementing the shooting of the convict . 16. Commander provides a sign / gesture to the firing squad commander to bring the firing squad to the front position . 17. Execution commander takes his place in front of the right side facing of the firing squad . 18.The execution commander ensures the firing squad is ready to fire . 19. The implementing commander draws a sword as a symbol for the firing squad to aim towards the heart of the convict . 20. The executing commander brandishes the sword forward  as a cue to the firing squad to unlock weapons . 21. The executing commander brings down the sword as a gesture  to tell the firing squad to perform simultaneous shooting . 22. After shooting is finished the executing commander sheaths his sword as a cue to the firing squad to stand their weapons . 23.The executing commander and doctors check the condition of the convicted person and if the doctor thinks that the convict is still showing signs of life, the prosecutor makes an order to the shooting commander . 24. The executing commander and doctors check the condition of the convicted person and if the convict is still breathing orders that a pistol be put to his temple just above the ear for a final shot . 25. Shooting can be repeated, if according to a doctor's certificate is still  signs of life . 26. Execution of the death penalty is declared finished, if the doctor has stated that there are no more signs of life on the convict . 27. Completion of the firing squad and the shooting commander orders its members to remove the magazine and empty their weapons . Convicted Bali bomber Subur Sugiarto, who took part in the 2005 bombings, is pictured in one of the prisons on Nusa Kambangkan . One of Indonesia's crack shooters in the elite Brimob mobile paramilitary brigade who carried out the courty's favoured method of execution, death by firing squad . At at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap, there are currently no signs of the horror awaiting the two Australians or the seven other people who may also be executed at the same time - four from Indonesia and one each from Brazil, Ghana and Nigeria. The topical island appeared idyllic on Wednesday, and children jumped in and out of the calm waters of the port. Indonesian residents, living on the mainland across from the island (pictured in the background), reported hearing volleys of rifles shots as the firing squad performed practice drills in preparation for the execution . But the scene at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap, where the island serves only as a seemingly peaceful backdrop, showed no signs of the horror waiting to unfold as children jumped in and out of the calm waters .",

        "article": "By . Pa Reporter . Steve Stricker's slim chance of making the United States Ryder Cup team is gone after the 47-year-old confirmed he will not play again until December due to injury. Stricker had already been chosen as one of captain Tom Watson's assistants alongside Andy North and Ray Floyd but, after a seventh-placed finish at the US PGA Championship, Watson revealed he had not ruled out handing the 12-time PGA Tour winner a wild card. That will not be happening now, however, as Stricker has confirmed he is going to 'shut it down' for the time being due to back and hip injuries. Scroll down to see Rory and Woods take the Ice Bucket Challenge . Shut it down! Steve Stricker has been forced to withdraw from the Ryder Cup with back and hip injuries . 'Sounds like I've got a back and hip issue,' he wrote in a text message to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. 'Going to shut it down till December. Rest and rehab and then try to play and see how it goes.' Although Stricker's chances of playing in a fourth consecutive Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next month were slim, Watson had admitted after the US PGA at Valhalla that his vice captain was still eager to try to make the team. Slim: US captain Tom Watson had chosen Stricker as his vice captain, although he also had a chance of playing . 'Our new vice-captain, Steve Stricker, is also battling through a hip injury, Watson wrote in a blog for the PGA of America. 'It's been a problem for a while now and I think it's the reason he's had a hard time stringing four rounds together this year until last week. He played great at Valhalla and tied for seventh. 'Steve actually called me on Thursday night. He asked if I was considering him for a captain's pick. I said, 'Absolutely, I am'.' The Wisconsin native is the latest in an ever-growing list of players that Watson will not have at his disposal when the Ryder Cup tees off on September 26. Man down! Tiger Woods is the highest profile withdrawal from the US Ryder Cup team . Tiger Woods has ruled himself out of the running for a pick due to his own back problems while Dustin Johnson has taken a break from the game as he seeks 'professional help for personal challenges'. Matt Kuchar has qualified for the team but could be a doubt after he withdrew before the start of the US PGA with a back injury, while Jason Dufner's title defence lasted just 10 holes with a serious neck problem and he dropped out of the automatic places as a result. Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed and Zach Johnson are the nine players to have automatically qualified for Tom Watson's team, with the captain announcing his three picks on September 2.

        "article": "(CNN) -- Calling himself \"deeply flawed,\" now-disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong says he used an array of performance enhancing drugs to win seven Tour de France titles then followed that by years of often-angry denials. \"This is too late, it's too late for probably most people. And that's my fault,\" he said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired Thursday night. \"(This was) one big lie, that I repeated a lot of times.\" Armstrong admitted using testosterone and human growth hormone, as well as EPO -- a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production. It increases the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to muscles, improving recovery and endurance. In addition to using drugs, the 2002 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year admitted to Winfrey that he took blood transfusions to excel in the highly competitive, scandal-ridden world of professional cycling. Doping was as much a part of the sport as pumping up tires or having water in a bottle, Armstrong said, calling it \"the scariest\" that he didn't consider it cheating at the time. 12 telling quotes over the years from Armstrong . The same man who insisted throughout and after his career that he'd passed each of the \"hundreds and hundreds of tests I took\" contended in the interview that he wouldn't have won without doing what he did. While Armstrong didn't invent the culture of doping in cycling, he said, he admitted not acting to prevent it either. \"I made my decisions,\" Armstrong said. \"They are my mistakes.\" Armstrong: I was \"a bully\" The first installment in his interview, which was conducted earlier this week with the talk-show host, aired Thursday on the OWN cable network and on the Internet. The second installment will be broadcast Friday night. Armstrong admitted he was \"a bully ... in the sense that I tried to control the narrative,\" sometimes by spewing venom at ex-teammates he thought were \"disloyal,\" as well as suing people and publications that accused him of cheating. He described himself as \"a fighter\" whose story of a happy marriage, recovery from cancer and international sporting success \"was so perfect for so long.\" \"I lost myself in all of that,\" he said, describing himself as both a \"humanitarian\" and a \"jerk\" who'd been \"arrogant\" for years. \"I was used to controlling everything in my life.\" iReport: Tell us your take on the first part of the interview . The scandal has tarred the cancer charity Livestrong that he founded, as well as tarnished his once-glowing reputation as a sports hero. Those who spoke out against Armstrong at the height of his power and popularity not only felt his wrath but the wrath of an adoring public. Now, with Armstrong stripped of endorsement deals and his titles, those who did speak out are feeling vindicated. They include Betsy Andreu, wife of fellow cyclist Frankie Andreu, who said she overheard Armstrong acknowledge to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs. She later testified about the incident and began cooperating with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against Armstrong. Armstrong subsequently ripped her, among others. More recently, he said he'd reached out to her to apologize -- in what Andreu called \"a very emotional phone call.\" \"This was a guy who used to be my friend, who decimated me,\" Andreu told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night. \"He could have come clean. He owed it to me. He owes it to the sport that he destroyed.\" In his interview with Winfrey, Armstrong said he understands why many might be upset that it took him so long to speak out, especially after going on the offensive for so long. He said he's reached out in recent days to several people, such as Andreu, who publicly accused him of doping and then were attacked -- and in some cases sued -- by him. Bleacher Report: Twitter erupts Thursday night . And the former athletic icon also conceded he'd let down many fans \"who believed in me and supported me\" by being adamant, sometimes hurtful and consistently wrong in his doping denials. \"They have every right to feel betrayed, and it's my fault,\" he said. \"I will spend the rest of my life ... trying to earn back trust and apologize to people.\" Years of success and defiance, then a rapid fall . The Texas-born Armstrong grew up to become an established athlete, including winning several Tour de France stages. But his sporting career ground to a halt in 1996 when he was diagnosed with cancer. He was 25. He returned to the cycling world, however. His breakthrough came in 1999, and he didn't stop as he reeled off seven straight wins in his sport's most prestigious race. Allegations of doping began during this time, as did Armstrong's defiance, including investigations and a lawsuit against the author of a book accusing him of taking performance enhancing drugs. He left the sport after his last win, in 2005, only to return to the tour in 2009. Armstrong insisted he was clean when he finished third that year, but that comeback led to his downfall. \"We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back,\" he told Winfrey. In 2011, Armstrong retired once more from cycling. But his fight to maintain his clean reputation wasn't over, including a criminal investigation launched by federal prosecutors. That case was dropped in February. But in April, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency notified Armstrong of an investigation into new doping charges. In response, the cyclist accused the organization of trying to \"dredge up discredited\" doping allegations and, a few months later, filed a lawsuit in federal court trying to halt the case. In retrospect, Armstrong told Winfrey he \"would do anything to go back to that day.\" \"Because I wouldn't fight, I wouldn't sue them, I'd listen,\" he said, offering to speak out about doping in the future. The USADA found \"overwhelming\" evidence that Armstrong was involved in \"the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program.\" In August, Armstrong said he wouldn't fight the charges, though he didn't admit guilt either. And the hits kept on coming. In October, the International Cycling Union stripped him of all his Tour de France titles. Even then, he remained publicly defiant, tweeting a photo of himself a few weeks later lying on a sofa in his lounge beneath the seven framed yellow jerseys from those victories. Then the International Olympic Committee stripped him of the bronze medal he won in the men's individual time trial at the 2000 Olympic Games and asked him to return the award, an IOC spokesman said Thursday. The USOC was notified Wednesday that the IOC wants the medal back, USOC spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. \"We will shortly be asking Mr. Armstrong to return his medal to us, so that we can return it to the IOC.\" Livestrong: Tell the truth about doping .

' Estimate, . a five-year-old filly, failed the test when the painkiller morphine was . found in a sample taken after a race, Buckingham Palace said. Trained . by leading flat racing trainer Sir Michael Stoute, Estimate won the . Ascot Gold Cup last year - the first royal horse to win the prestigious . race. A screen grab is doing the rounds on Twitter - causing much hilarity . She came second in this year\u2019s Gold Cup last month, when the test is believed to have occurred. The . revelation came five days after the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) announced that at least five horses, from various trainers, had tested . positive for banned drugs following race meetings. It has begun an investigation. Morphine is a permitted medication for racehorses but is banned on race days. Initial . indications are that Estimate\u2019s positive test was caused by her eating . contaminated feed, the Palace said. The Queen has been informed. Following . the BHA\u2019s announcement, Northamptonshire-based feed manufacturer Dodson . and Horrell, which has held a royal warrant since 1985, said its . suppliers had informed the company of possible contamination and it . destroyed all of its stock of a feed called Alfalfa Oil Plus. Estimate is pictured left on its way to winning The Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in 2013 . The Queen watched Estimate win the Gold Cup on Ladies Day with her racing manager John Warren in 2013 . John . Warren, the Queen\u2019s bloodstock and racing adviser, said: \u2018Sir Michael is . working closely with the feed company involved to discover how the . product may have become contaminated prior to delivery to his stables. \u2018As the . BHA investigates this matter, including potential links between the . different cases, Sir Michael continues to offer his full co-operation.\u2019 Once . investigations are complete, the cases will be put before a BHA . disciplinary panel which will decide if any should be taken. This could include disqualifying the horses involved from the races they had competed in. Winning ways: Leading Light (far right) streaks past Estimate (centre, sheepskin noseband) to take the Gold Cup on Ladies Day at Royal Ascot this year . Estimate, ridden by Ryan Moore, in action during of The Sagaro Stakes at Ascot in May 2013 . If . Estimate did test positive after this year\u2019s Gold Cup, the horse could . be stripped of her second place and the Queen would forfeit the \u00a380,625 . prize. When . Estimate won last year\u2019s Gold Cup, the Queen cheered her to victory and . then joined jockey Ryan Moore and trainer Sir Michael for the . presentation \u2013 which had to be hastily rearranged as she had been due to . hand over the trophy. The Duke of York stepped in to make the presentation to his mother, who also won \u00a3155,960 in prize money.",

        "article": "The Van Gaal/Mourinho love-in made me sick . Balotelli should take a look at Sanchez . In 25 years covering football at all levels, from way down the pyramid to the World Cup final, I don\u2019t think I have ever come across a footballer more determined and passionate about playing for England than Saido Berahino - and he\u2019s got special reason as well. Berahino\u2019s back story is well-known, but let me briefly fill you in. Born in Burundi, his mother fled the war-torn country after his father had died. She made her way to England, 10-year-old Saido arrived here alone some time after. There was a lot of red-tape, but mother and son were eventually allowed to live in the same home in Birmingham, and young Berahino started playing football and learning English. Young West Brom striker Saido Berahino is determined and passionate about playing for the England team . Berahino keeps his cool to score a vital equaliser from the penalty spot against Crystal Palace on Saturday . The 21-year-old Baggies frontman is the current leading English goalscorer in the Barclays Premier League . Berahino arrived in England at the age of 10 after his mother fled war-torn Burundi following his father's death . He says that this is when his life finally started. What England did for Berahino and his family is constantly running through his heart and head. Forget the fact he wasn\u2019t born in England \u2013 he oozes more passion for this country than he could if he was born in Buckingham Palace with a plate of fish and chips in one hand, a Union Jack in the other, and whistling the theme tune to Coronation Street. This is what he said when I asked him what playing for England would mean to him: 'It would mean the world to me as England have given me a second chance to have a better life for me and my family.' Berahino, pictured celebrating  for the Under 21s, admits it would be a dream come true to play for England . West Brom career . Premier League appearances: 41 . Premier League goals: 12 . West Brom (2014/15) Premier League appearances: 9 . Premier League goals: 7 . England Under 21s . Appearances: 13 . Goals: 10 . I\u2019m not one of those who think most England players aren\u2019t passionate about representing their country. I\u2019ve always thought that is a lazy accusation. Some people study whether the players sing the national anthem \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that stuff to be honest, despite the fact I\u2019m a true England fan. I care about how they play, but more importantly I care about their willingness to play. At every level from England Under 16 upwards, Berahino has always willingly turned up, when so many others cried off. Even when heavily tipped to move up to the senior squad, Berahino accepted that he was staying in the Under 21s and went out and performed to the best of his ability. I doubt you care much about England if you\u2019ve read this and not felt keen to see the West Brom striker wear the Three Lions on his shirt. You want passion with England? You want someone who cares about this country? You want someone who feels they owe it to this country to give his very, very best and more? Then let\u2019s get Berahino into the England squad as soon as possible please. I haven\u2019t even mentioned how good a footballer he is \u2013 the goals speak for themselves. At every level, from England Under 16 upwards, Berahino has always willingly turned up to play . Berahino gets the better of Man United defender Rafael to score against the Red Devils earlier this season . But I watched him carefully against Crystal Palace on Saturday and it\u2019s fair to say he didn\u2019t have his best game, but he still contributed two key moments. West Brom were trailing 2-0 at The Hawthorns when Berahino started a move on the left. He picked up the ball on the edge of the area and curled a terrific shot towards the far corner, only to see it superbly tipped behind by Julian Speroni. This was five minutes into the second half, and it got the Baggies going, it woke them up and West Brom scored from the subsequent corner. Berahino also kept his cool to score the penalty deep into added time that gave West Brom a point. With West Brom trailing against Palace, Berahino brought the Baggies to life as they fought back to draw 2-2 . Berahino places the ball past a stretching Wayne Hennessey to claim a point for the Baggies on Saturday . There are strikers getting in the England squad who don\u2019t even play, let alone score. At West Bromwich Albion you have a committed and very good young striker in the form of his life who is passionate about playing for England. It\u2019s a no-brainer. Do the decent thing, Roy.",

        "article": "A haul of sketches and paintings by one of the world's most prolific art forgers - whose work was described as often more beautiful than the original - has been put up for sale. Eric Hebborn duped art dealers and galleries world-wide with his\u00a0paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Michelangelo. His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals, and much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world. After he was murdered in 1996 his sister retrieved all of the work left in his studio, including scores of 'doodles' or preparatory drawings in ink, crayon and watercolours which appear to show Hebborn practicing imitating the old masters' hand. A water sketch of seated deity, based on Michelangelo's Prophet Jeremiah, by master forger Eric Hebborn . Now, 236 drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from \u00a3100 to \u00a3500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire. In one sketch, the master forger has almost exactly copied Michelangelo's Prophet Jeremiah. Other drawings are in Renaissance style but not specific to a particular artist. Hebborn was never prosecuted by police for fraud. He was murdered after being beaten about the head with a blunt instrument by a mystery attacker in Italy in 1996. Auctioneer Simon Wingett said: 'Eric Hebborn was probably the world's best ever art forger - he was as good as it got when it came to drawing. 'He created his own pictures in the style of the old masters.' Hebborn, from London, maintained he never tried to convince people his works were originals but he also never signed them and was happy to let art dealers believe that they were by old masters. Lot 244, a water sketch of two figures based on Michelangelo. \u00a0Hebborn created around 1,000 drawings and paintings in the style of Renaissance greats such Rubens, Van Dyck, Corot and Castiglione . Lot 365, an ink and wash sketch of two figures wrestling an animal to the ground. His work was so convincing that dealers sold them on as genuine originals . Beneath one of the drawings in the style of landscape and portrait painter Jean-Baptiste Corot, he wrote: 'Only the experts are worth fooling, the greater the expert the greater the satisfaction of deceiving them.' Mr Wingett said:\u00a0'He never really set out to deceive but was led down that path by dealers who wanted to make whatever they could out of him. 'They were happy to believe they were originals as were the museums they sold them to. 'Some rather famous names in the art world were involved and some rather famous museums all over the world that have Hebborns in them without realising. 'Even if they had their suspicions they are never going to want to be proved wrong because of their reputation. Lot 369, a pencil sketch of Daniel in the Lion's Den. Hebborn's\u00a0drawings are being sold in individual lots, ranging in price from \u00a3100 to \u00a3500 each by Webbs of Wilton auctioneers in Wiltshire . Lot 366, a pencil and wash sketch of two prostrate figures. Much of his undetected work still hangs in galleries and museums around the world. A watercolour of a coastal scene and wrecked wooden fishing boat, signed in pencil by Hebborn.\u00a0He studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work . 'His was the highest quality work. These drawings were part of his loose works or doodles of his. Some of them are preparatory drawings for bigger work, such as a finished oil paintings that may be hanging in a museum somewhere.' Hebborn studied at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in the 1950s and turned to forgery after critics failed to appreciate his own work. His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper . A pencil and charcoal drawing of two figures and an angel.\u00a0Hebborn confessed to making forged work but insisted he had done nothing wrong and instead blamed the art dealers for allowing themselves to be deceived . A lady scrubbing a floor.\u00a0Auctioneer Simon Wingett said: 'Eric Hebborn was probably the world's best ever art forger - he was as good as it got when it came to drawing' An ink and wash drawing of a group of various figures, in the style of George Romney. Hebborn created his own pictures in the style of the old masters . A\u00a0self-portrait of Eric Hebborn (left) and (right) an ink and wash sketch, styled after Giovanni Battista Piranesi, a study for a Frontispiece . His deception was revealed in 1978 when a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, US, examined two drawings from an established dealer of old master work and noticed they had been executed on the same kind of paper. Hebborn confessed to making forged work in 1984 but insisted he had done nothing wrong and instead blamed the art dealers for allowing themselves to be deceived. Mr Wingett added: 'These drawings provide a fascinating insight into somebody who made a lot of money for people and deceived some of the finest art institutions in the world. 'While many people would quite like to forget Eric Hebborn there is a new generation of art enthusiasts who don't know who he was and would be interested in these drawings.' The sale takes place on October 22.",

        "article": "The terrorist group Al Qaida seized control of a major airport, sea port and oil terminal in southern Yemen today, consolidating its hold on the country's largest province. It came  amid wider chaos\u00a0pitting Shiite rebels against forces loyal to the exiled president and a Saudi-led air campaign. Military officials and residents said Al Qaida fighters clashed briefly with members of one of Yemen's largest brigades outside Mukalla, a city the militants overran earlier this month and where they freed prison inmates. Protests: Shiite rebels chant slogans as they hold up their weapons during a demonstration against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Houthi leaders, in Sanaa, Yemen on Thursday . Today, Shiite rebels were involved in a demonstration on Thursday against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday . The militants then seized control of the Riyan airport and moved to secure their hold on the city's main sea port, which is also an oil terminal. Security officials said the leaders of the brigade in charge of protecting the entire area fled. The latest advance marks a major gain for Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, as the Yemeni affiliate is known. The group has exploited the chaos in Yemen, where Shiite rebels, along with allied military units loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, captured the capital in September and have been advancing despite a three-week Saudi-led air campaign. The rebels are staunch opponents of Al Qaida but are currently locked in fierce battles with forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognised President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who fled to Saudi Arabia last month. The south eastern city of Mukalla is the capital of Yemen's largest province, Hadramawt, where Al Qaida has long maintained a presence despite US drone strikes and Yemeni counter terrorism operations. Nasser Baqazouz, an activist in the city, said the troops guarding the airport put up little resistance. A politician in Mukalla, Ali al-Kathiri, said Al Qaida and local tribal leaders had been negotiating with the brigade commanders to ensure a peaceful handover. As Al Qaida seized control of a major airport, sea port and oil terminal in southern Yemen today, Shiite rebels took part in a demonstration against an arms embargo . Rebels protesting against the arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Houthi leaders . However, some fighters, suspected of being loyal to Saleh, clashed with the militants. A smaller air defence brigade handed over its camp to Al Qaida, apparently to avoid clashes, al-Kathiri said. A Saudi-led coalition has been striking the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and their allies from the air since March 26, but has carried out no attacks on Mukalla or other Al Qaida-controlled areas. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that at least 364 civilians are reported to have been killed since the start of the airstrikes at the end of March, including at least 84 children and 25 women. This is in addition to hundreds of fighters killed. Today, Shiite rebels were involved in a demonstration against an arms embargo imposed by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday. The resolution targets the rebels who rule most of Yemen.",

Chilling leaked footage of South African paralympian Oscar Pistorius re-enacting the moment he shot and killed his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp was taken illegally, according to the athlete's lawyers. The harrowing video, which shows Pistorius as he runs towards the the camera with one arm outstretched as if holding a gun, was broadcast on the Sunday Night documentary slot of . Australia's Channel Seven. But a statement from Pistorius' lawyers Ramsay Webber said the 'visual mapping' re-enactment was only for trial preparation. They alleged the footage had been 'obtained\u00a0 illegally' by Channel Seven. Scroll down for video . In the footage from Australia's Channel Seven, Pistorius is seen running awkwardly through a living room without his prosthetic legs. His right arm is stretched out in front of him, as if he was clutching a gun . Further into the video, he can be seen lifting a woman re-creating the moment he found Reeva shot . Pistorius, who remains emotionless throughout the footage, holds his hand out in front of him, in place of a gun . 'For the family, the airing of this footage constitutes a staggering breach of trust and an invasion of the family's privacy,' Brian Webber\u00a0said in a statement, according to Reuters. They said no permission for the disclosure of the material had been given. One legal expert in Johannesburg, Professor Stephen Tuson of the Wits School of Law, told Reuters the screening of the re-enactment footage could be a breach of sub-judice laws that prohibit the publication outside the courtroom of evidence or material that could influence the outcome of the trial. \"If this was done in preparation for the trial in the context of attorney-client confidentiality, it would be privileged and its publication would be a breach of the sub-judice rule. Its consequences could be a reviewable irregularity,\" Tuson told Reuters. Sunday Night Executive Producer, Mark Llewellyn, said in a statement that the story 'was a significant investigation by Walkley Award-winning journalists'. 'We would not have run the footage if we thought we had obtained it illegally. The story was run in Australia only and not made available to any other territory,' Mr Llewellyn said. 'The material shown on Sunday Night goes to the heart of both the prosecution and defense cases, including the account provided by Oscar Pistorius.' Pistorius, who was born without a fibula bone in either leg and had his lower legs amputated before he could walk, is seen moving quite quickly and with a high level of agility for a man without the bottom half of his legs. Pistorius can be seen running towards and away from the camera and circling back around the living room of his home. As he re-enacts the scene he explains to investigators: 'I heard the noise and fired four shots.' Pistorius' lawyers alleged the usage of the video filmed by a U.S. company specialising in forensic animation, The Evidence Room, which had been engaged by Pistorius' defence team, also breached a non-disclosure agreement made with the Cleveland, Ohio company, Reuters reports. The footage is overlayed with a recording of Pistorious' voice, a recreation of the moment he claims he warned what he believed was an intruder in the bathroom. 'I'll call the police, get out, get out! Get the f*** out!,' he said. The paralympian can then be heard screaming and shouting hysterically after he opened the door to find his girlfriend dead on the bathroom floor. 'Please, God, please, please help. Help me. Help me!' In another scene the athlete can be seen on all fours, dragging a woman from a bathroom similar to the one in which he shot Miss Steenkamp. Later in the chilling footage, Pistorius is timed on how long it takes him to put his prosthetic legs on, just over 25 seconds. He then recreates the moment, slumping himself over the toilet with his legs splayed on the floor, he found his girlfriend 'bleeding to death' after he beat down the bathroom door with a cricket bat. Pistorius recreated the whole event in the chilling footage, including his movements from the bathroom to the bedroom . The footage also times how long Pistorius takes to put his prosthetic legs on . In another harrowing excerpt from the video, Pistorius shows how he found his girlfriend slumped over the toilet bleeding to death . Scott Roder, an American crime scene specialist, told Sunday Night that when he had his legs or blades on Pistorius was a confident man. However when he was without them he felt vulnerable. 'When he's on his stumps, he's short, the confidence washes away from his face,' Mr Roder said. The program reported that Mr Roder prepared a full analysis of the crime scene and supplied it to Pistorius' defence team. Earlier on Sunday a leaked promotional clip was released by Seven. This week a psychiatrist told the Pretoria court that Pistorius could not simply run away if he found himself in a vulnerable position. Even turning around is 'quite a process', he said. Oscar Pistorius maintains that he shot Reeva Steenkamp thinking she was an intruder . The video is reported to have been shot by an American company and Pistorius' lawyers are said to be livid at how the video was released. Pistorius' spokeswoman Anneliese Burgress has said the 27-year-old's legal advisors are seeking 'urgent clarification' from the broadcaster in relation to the footage. It was reported before the trial that an American firm called The Evidence Room was preparing an animated re-enactment of the events, but no mention was made of it in court. Pistorius, 27, . is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp. He shot her four times through a locked toilet door at his Pretoria home on Valentine\u2019s Day last year. The . double amputee told the court he was convinced she was an intruder and that he fired his 9mm pistol accidentally out of fear and panic. He said he went to . investigate the noises coming from the cubicle before he fired. Pistorius' trial resumed last week after a lengthy adjournment so the paralympian could undergo intense psychiatric evaluation. The trial heard that Pistorius has a 'split personality' with a superstar . status in front of the cameras and a private life as a disabled man. His legal team said he was acting out of 'morbid fear not anger' when he shot dead his girlfriend. As . the Paralympic star\u2019s lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal . team have presented Pistorius as a highly . vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every . day of his life. The prosecution paint a picture of a volatile, gun-toting man. Reading . from a psychiatric report into Pistorius\u2019 mindset, defence counsel . Kenny Oldwage told Pretoria\u2019s High Court on Wednesday that the runner was 'the . international superstar more confident and in control' standing six feet . tall on his famous carbon blades. While he was 'a vulnerable and fearful . disabled person' barely five feet tall on his stumps. As the lengthy trial finally draws to a close, his legal team have been at pains to paint a picture of Pistorius as a highly vulnerable double amputee who battled great pain and genuine fears every day of his life . Pistorius, 27, is accused of deliberately murdering Reeva Steenkamp by shooting four bullets through a locked toilet door at his home in the South African capital on Valentine's Day last year . Professor . Wayne Derman, who specialises in treating disabled athletes, is the . final witness to appear in defence of the sprinter who. He said: 'Although he loathes to be pitied in any way, the . hard truth is that he does not have lower legs. You\u2019ve got a paradox, . of an individual who is supremely able and an individual who is . significantly disabled.' Professor Derman will face a second day of gruelling cross-examination from prosecutor Gerrie Nel when the trial resumes on Monday. Pistorius, . whose carbon running prosthetics have earned him the nickname the . \u2018Blade Runner\u2019, denies murder and three firearms charges. Miss Steenkamp\u2019s mother June, who has seen much of the trial at Pretoria High Court, hopes her daughter will rest in peace after the verdict. She said: 'I don\u2019t hate Oscar, I\u2019ve forgiven him. But I am determined to face him.'",

        "article": "The U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be\u00a0'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer. Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer said on\u00a0Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor on Monday night that\u00a0Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban.' The former military intelligence officer said he had been told the information by  two senior sources who knew about a 2009 Naval Criminal Investigative Service investigation into Bergdahl's\u00a0activities. Scroll down for video . Bowe Bergdahl, the U.S. Army Sergeant who left his post in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years was found to have be 'going over to the other side with a deliberate plan,' according to a former military intelligence officer . The investigation reportedly included a forensic review of Bergdahl's\u00a0computer which showed his apparent intent to travel to Uzbekistan. 'He had made contact with local Afghans and wanted to be moved to Uzbekistan and then made contact with the Russians because he wanted to talk to Russian organized crime,'\u00a0Shaffer told O'Reilly. 'Clearly he was not all there relating to what he was doing. I think we're going to see more and more, as this report is made public that there were a number of disconcerting things within Bergdahl.' Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer (pictured) \u00a0said on Fox News ' 'The O'Reilly Factor' on Monday night that Bowe Bergdahl 'had Afghan contacts and he was actually trying to offer himself up with the Taliban. Both are very severe' He said the NCIS investigaiton, \u00a0which included interviews with squad mates, indicated that\u00a0Bergdahl made contact with an Afghan in an attempt to prepare for his departure. Bowe\u00a0Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . Army officials announced Thursday that his Article 32 hearing will be held July 8 at Fort Sam Houston, Texas -\u00a0he is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. That proceeding is similar to a civilian grand jury. From there, it could be referred to a court-martial and go to trial. His attorney says Bergdahl was trying to find a U.S. general officer to report a disturbing situation when he left his combat outpost. Eugene Fidell, the attorney leading Bergdahl's defense, said in a letter released this week that the Army major general who investigated Bergdahl's capture in Afghanistan found he did not intend to remain away from his base permanently. Bergdahl disappeared in June, 2009 from a combat post in Paktika Province in eastern Afghanistan and was captured by the Taliban. He spent five years as a prisoner of war before he was freed last summer in a prisoner swap that angered members of congress members and some members of his unit. After an investigation of the circumstances of his capture, Bergdahl was charged this week with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, counts that could lead to life in prison. Documents released by his defense lawyers suggested the tack they may take in defending Bergdahl. The papers also included a statement from Bergdahl about his attempts to escape from his Taliban captors and his beatings while a prisoner. In a March 2 letter to Army General Mark Milley, who was responsible for deciding how to proceed with the case, Fidell said an investigation by an Army major general had concluded that Bergdahl did not plan to desert. 'While hedging its bets, the report basically concludes that Sergeant Bergdahl did not intend to remain away from the Army permanently, as classic 'long' desertion requires,' Fidell wrote. 'It also concludes that his specific intent was to bring what he thought were disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general office,' he added. Bowe Bergdahl, shown before his handover to US troops in May 2014 . Fidell declined to elaborate further on Friday. Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo Bay. They were sent to Qatar and had to remain there for a year. Some U.S. lawmakers were angered by Bergdahl's release because they were not given 30 days notice before the transfer of the Guantanamo prisoners, as required by law. Some fellow soldiers also said he had deserted. 'While many Americans have taken a broader and more sympathetic view, the depth and breadth of the current hostility to Sergeant Bergdahl are extraordinary and have enveloped the case with a lynch mob atmosphere,' Fidell said. 'Taliban five': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . He faces up to life in prison if convicted of misbehavior before the enemy. A former platoon-mate of Bergdahl told Daily Mail Online that Bergdahl is trying to win a public-relations battle with new claims about his defense strategy. CNN reported based on a Pentagon leak, that Bergdahl told Army investigators he left his forward operating base in 2009 so he could report 'a breakdown in discipline and order' to military higher-ups \u2013 not with desertion in mind. 'This is clearly just a stunt to build sympathy before they go to trial,' said retired Sgt. Jordan Vaughn, who spoke for the first time since the Army announced Bergdahl would be court-martialed. 'No logical person would ever take the actions he undertook for the reasons he is now saying,' Vaughn told Daily Mail Online. He said the claim broadcast by CNN is 'ridiculous,' and that the Army's decision to charge Bergdahl with desertion is 'in direct conflict' with any claim that he intended to be a whistle-blower. CNN reported that a Defense Department official said Bergdahl had 'concerns about leadership issues at his base. 'He needs to be held responsible for what he did, for abandoning his post, for abandoning his platoon, for putting thousands of American soldiers, Marines and the whole United States military, thousands of members, in more danger, putting us into spots we wouldn't already have been in, had he not walked away,' he said. President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . Vaughn also noted that his decision 'cost the US multiple soldiers' lives, five Taliban POWs, and the incredible monetary expense of searching for him.' However, both Cornelison and Buetow, who have left the US Army, stopped short of demanding that Sgt Bergdahl face prison. 'I don't want to ruin his life,' said Buetow. 'He does need to be dishonorably discharged, have all his ranks taken away, and he does not need to receive any benefits or back pay.' He added that he was proud the military had reached its decision despite the fact it would heap further pressure on the Obama administration for negotiating with the Taliban over a man accused of deserting. 'You can't get around the fact this makes some people look bad,' he said. But they had little sympathy for Sgt Bergdahl's account of being beaten and tortured during his time in Taliban captivity. 'He wouldn't have been put in that position, he wouldn't have been tortured, he wouldn't have been put through all that hardship if he'd never walked away,' said Cornelison. The punishments suggested by the veterans are within the range open to the court. It can reduce him to E-1, forfeit his pay and give him a dishonorable discharge.",

        "article": "By . Kirsty Walker . PUBLISHED: . 17:18 EST, 20 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 20 May 2012 . Right behind you: Boris Johnson with his adviser Guto Harri in 2009 . Guto Harri, Boris Johnson\u2019s ex- spin doctor, has accepted a lucrative job at News International. The former BBC journalist \u2013 who worked closely with the Tory London Mayor and helped mastermind his re-election \u2013 starts work today as communications director at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media company. Mr Harri\u2019s appointment will raise questions about continuing close links between the company and the Conservative Party, which are under intense scrutiny at the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards. Earlier this month it emerged that David Cameron nearly hired Mr Harri to be his spin doctor ahead of his eventual appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson. Mr Coulson told the inquiry that Mr Cameron had held talks with Mr Harri but was persuaded by George Osborne to hire him instead. Mr Harri, the BBC\u2019s former chief political correspondent, went on to become Mr Johnson\u2019s spin doctor when he first won office in 2008 and worked with the mayor until his re-election for a second term earlier this month. It is understood that the Prime Minister made a second attempt to woo Mr Harri after he let it be known that he would be stepping down as Mr Johnson\u2019s director of external affairs. Commenting on Mr Harri\u2019s new job, Labour MP Chris Bryant said: \u2018It feels a bit like the revolving door of the Conservative Party, the Metropolitan Police and News International continues to revolve.\u2019 Labour\u2019s media spokesman, Helen Goodman, said: \u2018It seems that the lure of Murdoch or his money is irresistible to some people in the political world \u2013 but this is a mistake, especially after Boris called for the head of the BBC to be a Tory. \u2018Of course newspapers have values but to be able to hold politicians to account they need a degree of independence from political parties, which Mr Harri is signally failing to demonstrate.\u2019 Mr Harri, 45, who is reported to be on a salary of \u00a3250,000 a year, will be responsible for restoring News International\u2019s battered image in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. But, after four years at Mr Johnson\u2019s side, he will have an intimate knowledge of the thinking of a politician still tipped to succeed Mr Cameron as Tory leader. Mr Harri replaces Andrew Honnor who held the position in an interim capacity and has recently set up his own agency. Links: Labour MP Chris Bryant, left, has questioned if the appointment of Guto Harri, centre, showed continuing close ties between the company run by Rupert Murdoch, right, and the Conservative Party . Mr Johnson, meanwhile, has been criticised for initially dismissing the hacking scandal as party political \u2018codswallop\u2019 in September 2010. Documents subsequently revealed that NI was at the time offering him \u00a32million towards an academy school in London and talking of donating millions more to sponsor another Johnson project, a cable car crossing the Thames. Pressure: Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, seen walking with former adviser Adam Smith, left, will appear before the Leveson Inquiry this week . In 2010, according to emails already published by Leveson, News International executive Will Lewis asked colleagues: \u2018Where are we with the schools project, particularly Boris securing the land and [Education Secretary] Michael Gove the capital investment?\u2019 Both offers were, however, dropped shortly afterwards. Beleaguered Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt faces more pressure this week when the men at the centre of the row over his handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. His former special adviser, Adam Smith, and News Corporation\u2019s chief lobbyist, Frederic Michel, will appear on Thursday, leading to fresh scrutiny of the minister\u2019s role in the \u00a38billion bid by the company to take full control of the broadcaster. Mr Smith quit last month after a damning 163-page dossier of emails between the minister\u2019s office and the Murdoch empire was published during James Murdoch\u2019s testimony to the inquiry. Mr Smith admitted he went \u2018too far\u2019 in handing sensitive information to Mr Michel, but said he acted \u2018without authorisation\u2019 from the minister. Mr Hunt insists he acted with propriety and did not know what Mr Smith was doing. News International chief executive Tom Mockridge said: \u2018Guto\u2019s experience as a communications professional, along with his solid journalistic background, means he is well qualified to lead us through the challenges we face as NI continues to change and progress.\u2019 Mr Harri said: \u2018With a proud heritage and firm commitment to serious journalism, I relish the chance to play my part in helping the new leadership secure a strong future.\u2019 Last week, the company\u2019s former chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, 43, was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice along with her husband Charlie and four others. She protests her innocence.",

        "article": "By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 04:51 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:50 EST, 27 November 2013 . A block of luxury seaside penthouses have been lying empty since February following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land. Developers of the \u00a31m flats have been locked in a long-running legal battle with the owners of a 'ransom strip' which runs between the newly-built flats and a neighbouring block. But now the developers of the Nirvana apartments, in the Leas, Westcliff, Essex, which were completed earlier this year but have still not gone on the market, have said the matter is 'about to be resolved'. The luxury seaside Nirvana apartments were completed earlier this year but are still not on the market following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land . Owners of the ransom strip have said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land . The 45 apartments were approved by Southend Council in 2007 and the development was finished earlier this year but they are still not on the market . The owners of the ransom strip have previously said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land. Mike Gray, managing director of Dedman Gray, the marketing agent for the site, indicated a resolution was close. He said: 'The strip of land did stall the marketing during the summer months and this matter quite clearly is about to be resolved. 'Taking into consideration the December and Christmas market is soon upon us, the relaunch and full marketing of these apartments will now be set up for the middle of January in the New Year.' Lucy Courtenay, secretary of the local Chalkwell Ward Residents\u2019 Association, said: 'The view was that it\u2019s not the most attractive of buildings but having built it, it\u2019s a great shame it\u2019s still standing empty.' Jane Hendry, also a member of the association, said: 'We\u2019ve been trying to find out the situation from our councillors, but there seems to be little information available.' Ransom strips, commonly used between developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property . A street view of the Nirvana apartments (right) from April 2012 shows the development before completion . The three owners of the strip have previously said there had been no agreement allowing residents of the Nirvana flats (pictured during development) to cross it to reach the parking area . The 45 flats were approved by Southend . Council in 2007, and the nine-storey development was finished earlier this year after the economic downturn slowed down work. However the owners of the 100yards by 6in strip, which lies between the flats and neighbouring Bellway Court, appointed a legal team alleging Nirvana\u2019s developers do not have permission to cross their so-called ransom strip. Ransom strips, commonly used between developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property. The three owners, who sold the neighbouring land in the 1980s but retained ownership of the ransom strip, had previously said there had been no agreement allowing Nirvana residents to cross it to reach the concealed parking area.",

        "article": "It takes Bradley Denton more than two hours to get ready for a night out - as he transforms himself into his drag queen persona Pearle Gattes. The 19-year-old dance student, from Leeds, says he has always felt more at home in the womenswear section of stores, and started dressing ultra-feminine two years ago. In fact, Bradley only goes out as the male version of himself if he's with people he's only just met at university. Scroll down for video . By night Bradley Denton transforms himself into drag persona Pearle Gattes (right) 'When I was 18 I started working as a dancer at a gay bar in York and I absolutely loved it,' he said. 'I felt really at home there and was made to feel really welcome but now I think it was more than that: for the first time in my life, I felt like I was where I belonged. 'When I'm Pearle, I feel so much more at home and I'm actually comfortable in my own skin. More than that: when I'm Bradley I long to be Pearle again.' When he first came out to his parents, Bradley's father refused to speak to him for over a week. But he did eventually succumb, saying that Bradley being gay wasn't worth losing their father-son relationship. Bradley said: 'It was really hard to take at first because my Dad's my idol. Ever since he was little he would put on pretty much everything he could find in his mother's makeup bag . When he is Pearle, he feels so much more at home and says he is 'actually comfortable in my own skin' 'I felt like I'd done wrong by him but at the same time, I knew that I'd told him the truth so I had some really mixed emotions. 'In the end it was a massive relief when Dad accepted me for who I was and, ever since, my parents have been really supportive.' He also has revealed since dressing as a woman, has been beaten up more than 20 times. When he was withdrawing money on the way back from a night out, three men passed by and, assuming Pearle was a woman, wolf-whistled as they went. When it became clear Pearle was, in fact, a man, the men proceeded to beat him in a tirade of homophobic abuse. 'I'm used to it. If anything, the hate makes me stronger,' he said. 'I've had at least 20 beatings over the years simply because I'm gay. 'It's hard to take but at the same time it gives you that bit of fire in your belly. The abuse has made me absolutely certain that this is who I am and I'm right to stick to my guns.' Bradley looks dapper as his male ego (l) and loves to apply heavy makeup and wear short skirts as Pearle (r) When he was withdrawing money on a night out as Pearle, three men beat him after realising he was a boy . Bradley added: 'Ever since I was little I've always liked wearing heels. I used to put on pretty much everything I could find in Mum's makeup bag. 'Whenever I walked into a shop I'd always go into the womenswear section. All my friends at school were girls and they'd always apologise for \"forcing\" me around the womenswear section. 'What they didn't realise at the time was that I was far more comfortable in the womenswear section than the menswear. 'I'd been putting makeup on for years but I started dressing up in drag two or three years ago.' Bradley Denton in full drag as Pearle on the left, with an unnamed friend on the right . Whenever he is not Pearle, Bradley longs for his alter ego. He feels at home when dressed in drag .",

Virgin Atlantic flights from London to New York are scheduled to fly today for the first time since the biggest storm in US history caused travel chaos across the East Coast. The first Virgin flight scheduled to leave Heathrow at 9.20am flew out at 11.30am but another five flights are due to fly on time as New York's JFK and Newark's airport reopened. All BA flights to Boston, Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia are planned to operate as normal while the majority of the airline's flights to New York JFK and Newark were cancelled again today. The operator cancelled five flights from Heathrow to JFK, and one to Newark, but will send two planes to JFK this evening and one to Newark. Passengers from Heathrow to the east coast destinations in the US queue to check in as flights return to normal at Heathrow . After Hurricane Sandy wiped out parts of the east coast, many passengers were left stranded as airlines struggled to maintain a service . Airline operators have been keeping marooned passengers in hotels as they waited for the super storm . The number of British nationals . stranded on the East Coast of America by Superstorm Sandy should become . clearer today, according to Danny Lopez, the British consul-general to . New York. He told ITV's Daybreak: 'It has been a few hours now since Sandy has left but it has become very clear and very apparent what the path of destruction has been, not just in Manhattan but across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 'It is going to be a long process now towards recovery. \u2018This is the day where we will be hearing far more, I am sure. \u2018Over the last 48 hours we have actually only had 14 calls from Brits wanting more information. \u2018The . advice I am giving is that they contact their airlines before they . travel to the airport and I think that today it will become very clear . as to how many stranded passengers we have.\u2019 Speaking from Lower Manhattan, Mr Lopez said he had never seen anything like the destruction left by the storm. Mr . Lopez said: What we are hearing from authorities right now is that it . will probably take around three or four days for power to come back here . to this area.\u2019 Two Virgin Atlantic flights from New York were cancelled today but will send seven flights to New York from Heathrow and five return flights. Virgin is also putting on an extra flight which will leave Heathrow for New York around 1.50pm today and fly back from the hurricane-hit city later. Virgin had to axe its VS18 service from Newark and its VS26 flight from New York today. These would have landed at Heathrow this evening. However, the airline was able to operate normal services today to and from Boston and Washington DC. British Airways said they were launching . larger aircrafts to try and accommodate more passengers, and said they . had been putting stranded customers in hotels while they waited for . services to resume. Nearly 18,300 flights have been canceled since Sunday as a result of the storm, including 8,183 canceled on Monday, 7,258 on Tuesday and 2,829 so far for Wednesday, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. Sandy grounded more than 18,000 . flights across the North east of America and the globe, and it could be . days before some passengers finally get to board their planes. But Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo said that JFK is expected to reopen today. The three big New York airports were . closed on Tuesday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Stewart International Airport remained open, but airlines had suspended . operations there. A . BA spokesman said yesterday: 'Customer safety with regards to Hurricane . Sandy remains our highest priority and following advice from the US . authorities we have decided to cancel 15 return flights to and from the . East Coast of the USA on Tuesday.

'We are taking advice from US authorities and planning our operation and providing customer advice around that.' Yesterday's chaos came after tens of thousands of people were left stranded on both sides of the Atlantic following mass cancellations on . Monday. The route between the East Coast of the US and Western Europe is one of the busiest in the world. More than 2.6million passengers flew . from New York's JFK Airport to Heathrow in London last year - an average . of more than 7,100 per day. On average, almost 14,200 passengers fly from JFK to London, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt each day.

New York's LaGuardia Airport remains closed as thousands of travellers are stranded in the city devastated by Superstorm Sandy . The hurricane was estimated to affect up to 50million people, forcing . the shutdown of transport networks, schools and financial markets in . New York City and beyond, sending coastal residents fleeing for higher . ground, and threatening a dangerous mix of high winds, heavy rain and a . surging 11ft wall of water. The flight cancellations surpassed . those of a major winter storm in early 2011 that forced 14,000 flights . to be scrapped over four days. Among carriers which had to cancel flights were . US Airways, American Airlines and Delta. Even if storm damage is minor it . could be a week before operations are normal at major East Coast . airports, said Angela Gittens, director general of the Airports Council . International, a trade group for airports worldwide. 'The storm has such a wide swath and . so many major airports are involved that it's going to take some time . (to recover) because those airplanes are so far away,' said Gittens, who . served as aviation director at Miami International Airport Dade during . several hurricanes from 2001 to 2004. Britons already in America were . contending with shutdown public transport, with bus and train services . in New York and Philadelphia among those affected.

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 13:41 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:42 EST, 20 March 2013 . A church-going 83-year-old widow has . been handed a suspended jail sentence for 'waging psychological warfare' on her soldier neighbour and his young family after a football landed . in her garden. In a shocking campaign of harassment, . 'vile' pensioner Ethel Watkins \u2013 known as The Duchess on her middle-class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness \u2013 'visited mental torture' on the sergeant . major, his wife, and their two sons after they moved in next door. Watkins branded them 'scum' and . 'hooligans', deprived the youngsters of sleep by repeatedly banging on . the walls, and made up foul-mouthed songs about the family. 'Vile': 83 year-old Ethel Watkins leaves Loughborough Magistrates Court today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail . The great-grandmother, a member of the . Royal British Legion's Women's Section for 66 years before she was . kicked out for the offences, even set off her own burglar alarm to . disturb the peace. She also taunted the young mother about the loss of a . six-month-old baby and said she hoped her husband 'wouldn't come back . from Afghanistan' following a tour of duty. In a bid to stop the abuse, Watkins . was given a five-year restraining order in July last year preventing her . from contacting the family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, or . any visitors to their home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. She was handed the ban, and a fine, . after admitting a charge of harassment at Loughborough Magistrates' Court, and was told she had only just escaped jail because of her age. But incredibly, Watkins ignored the . warning, and was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance . for resuming her reign of terror on the quiet residential street. Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her garden . Watkins pleaded not guilty to . breaching the restraining order on four separate occasions - even . claiming that she was singing hymns instead of being abusive. But JPs at the same court rejected her denials and convicted her of the offences last December. Chairman of the bench Ben Faust adjourned sentence so psychiatric reports into Watkin's mental state could be prepared. Lisa O'Driscoll, defending, said . medical reports showed Watkins was suffering from the early stages of . dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and claimed this explained much of her . erratic behaviour. But Mr Faust said it was clear Watkins 'retained the capacity to know right from wrong'. He added: 'Your actions had a . significant impact on the children living next door to you. The family . were victimised by you to such an extent they had to leave home.' Mr Faust told Watkins that if the . family had remained at home, she would have been sent to prison because . it would have been the court's duty to protect them from further harm. Instead, she was given a 26-week jail . term, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the family \u00a32,000 in . compensation, as well as prosecution costs of \u00a3620. She was also reminded by magistrates that the existing five-year restraining order remained in place. At an earlier hearing, the court heard . the family, who now live in Cyprus where the Sgt Maj is based, moved in . next to Watkins in 2011 wanting to make a 'fresh start' after the loss . of their baby, and initially got on well with their new neighbour. The mother even confided in Watkins, . who lives alone, about the death of the child - but the relationship . turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in . Watkins' garden. Carol Huston, prosecuting, said the . trouble then escalated rapidly, with Watkins setting off her own burglar . alarm to prevent the children from sleeping. Abusive: The pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house, as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action . The hearing was told Watkins, who had . lived in her semi-detached home since 1991, would regularly insult the . mother with songs she had made up. Mrs Huston added: 'She would repeat . over and over things like \"You are poison, you are evil, you won't win, . go back to where you came from, you are nothing but a tramp\".' Mrs Huston said that on occasions, the taunts referred to the dead child. She said: 'Watkins would shout words similar to, \"What kind of life would the child have had if it lived?\"' The family were asked by police to log . every incident to build up a dossier of evidence against Watkins. Pictures the family took included the widow, who lives alone, flashing a . V sign as she passed their home. She was eventually arrested and . appeared in court on July 25 last year, where she admitted harassment . and was given the restraining order. However, just a day later Watkins committed her first breach. Watkins went on to commit three . further breaches of the restraining order in early September. She made . retching noises at the family, called the mother 'scum', and insulted . the children. After Watkins was found guilty of the breaches, victim impact statements from the family were read out. One female magistrate wept as the . court heard how Watkins' behaviour had left the mother 'depressed, . exhausted, and on the verge of a breakdown'. In her statement, she said Watkins had . waged 'psychological warfare against her and her family', adding she . was 'barely able to function without the support of her wider family'. In a new statement read before Watkins . was sentenced, her husband asked the court what steps would be taken to . protect his family from her when they return to the UK in two years' time. He added it would be very difficult to sell their home, as he would feel 'honour bound' to tell potential buyers about Watkins.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Rip it up and start again. As a 20-year-old, Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros' clay courts. All the portents suggested great things were ahead of the Serbian. Here was a tennis player with an impressive forehand and serve, with the added bonus of being incredibly marketable. But six years on, much like the characters Vladimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\" -- a drama about the passing of time -- the wait for a second grand slam shows no sign of ending. Since that win in Paris in 2008, Ivanovic has suffered from big-match nerves, serving woes and a series of injury problems. It is arguable she has also endured something of an identity crisis, chopping and changing coaching teams along the way. Her continuing search to help solve this problem and allow her to feel comfortable in her own skin has led her to appointing a support network who speak the same language. \"I've been working really hard,\" Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN's Open Court show. \"I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it's a Serbian team for me for the first time.\" Ivanovic's new team includes coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic -- who represented Montenegro in the Davis Cup -- fitness coach Zlatko Novkovic and physio Branko Penic. They have all been part of her entourage since her split with British coach Nigel Sears in July, following a second-round exit at Wimbledon. Her career is littered with coaches who have come and gone as she has searched for a winning formula to challenge consistently for grand slams. Since parting company with her early mentor Zoltan Kuharsky in 2006, she has employed David Taylor, Craig Kardon, Heinz Gunthardt, Antonio van Grichen and Sears. A number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the Adidas Player Development program. It's not just coaches that have come and gone. It's also true of fitness trainers. Such constant chopping and changing suggests a player stuck in a rut, desperately searching for a way out of it. Her desire to follow up that 2008 French Open win has also led Ivanovic to ponder why she picked up a racket at the age of five in the first place -- for the enjoyment. \"We are also having more fun and a lot of laughs on the court as well to make it interesting, because the year gets very long,\" she said of her team. In Kontic, Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears, yet the 32-year-old, ranked 1,635th in men's doubles, is able to offer her something that respect within the game cannot always buy -- a shared cultural identity. \"I'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you,\" Ivanovic said. Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently, according to a former grand slam champion turned coach. \"She's hooked up with someone she has trust in and she's finding herself,\" Jo Durie, who won mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, told CNN. \"It's about confidence with Ana. Her sense of trust in herself is what she needs. \"A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, I can never understand that. You need to get to know someone.\" Ivanovic's solitary grand slam win helped the baseliner become the world No. 1, for 12 weeks in total. Now ranked 14th, she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009, partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris. Wrist, shoulder, foot, abdominal and hip injuries all took their toll as Ivanovic fell to No. 65 in the rankings. Although she acknowledges that there have been improvements in the demands of the WTA Tour calendar, parts of the worldwide schedule are still difficult for the players. \"Especially at the end of the year when from America we mostly go back to Europe for a week and then we go to Asia for quite a few weeks, so that's kind of tiring and hard,\" she said. \"I know it's difficult to fit it all around it, but Asia at the end of the year really gets a lot of players.\" While her playing fortunes might have fluctuated, Ivanovic's marketability has never been dented. According to Forbes, she was the ninth highest-paid female athlete in 2013 with total earnings of $7 million -- brought in largely thanks to lucrative sponsorship deals including Adidas, Yonex, Juice Plux and Dubai Duty Free. Ivanovic has had a number of high-profile boyfriends -- including Masters-winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco -- but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered, it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship. Her latest campaign, though, does not look like being clouded by such distraction or, just as importantly, injury. Kicking off the 2014 season in Auckland, New Zealand, she ground out a victory against fellow former No. 1 Venus Williams to end a more than two-year title drought. It was the ideal preparation for next week's Australian Open. Despite Ivanovic's obvious talent, Durie doubts whether her game has the consistency required to win a grand slam. \"I think she'll find it difficult,\" added Durie. \"She can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches. \"She's capable of big wins, she can certainly beat players like Serena Williams. But can she beat Petra Kvitova and Serena in a row?\" Clijsters retired for a second time in 2012, having won four grand slams, as she decided to focus on her family -- and has since had a second child. Ivanovic, now 26, admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis. \"I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win,\" she told the Belgian. \"I don't want to put a date to it because I think you feel it when the time is right. Family is a big part of my life and I want to have lots of kids of my own one day. \"Tennis is a big part of my life, but it's not my whole life. So definitely I want to achieve what I can on the court and then focus.\"",

Mr Campell\u2019s video, \u2018It for Others\u2019, was inspired by a 1953 documentary about African art, featuring a dance sequence created with choreographer Michael Clark. However his \u00a325,000 win comes following criticism this year\u2019s nominees have turned the event into one that is \u2018sober, respectful, polite, middle aged\u2019 and lacks the fun and excitement of previous entries. Irish artist Duncan Campbell has been named winner of this year\u2019s Turner Prize for a video that tackles African art and colonialism but there is criticism the event has become \u2018sober, respectful, polite, middle aged\u2019 Mr Campell\u2019s video, \u2018It for Others\u2019, was inspired by a 1953 documentary about African art, featuring a dance sequence created with choreographer Michael Clark . Speaking to the Today programme yesterday, the BBC\u2019s Arts Editor Will Gompertz said: \u2018I think actually it\u2019s quite a weak year. I have to say I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a classic year.\u2019 He said this year\u2019s shortlist of three videos and one instillation featuring different prints, was tame comparied to the controversey stoked by artists such as Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst. He said: \u2018The Turner Prize has been going for 30 years and it\u2019s well beyond it\u2019s rebellious, anti-establishment, attention-seeking attitude of its teenage years \u2013 the Damien Hirsts and the formaldehyde cows and Tracey Emin\u2019s bed and Martin Creed\u2019s lights going on and off. \u2018All that fun and games has gone, and it\u2019s a much more sober, respectful, polite, middle aged prize. And it is full of introspection and frankly it isn\u2019t quite as exciting.\u2019 Ciara Phillips's 'Things Shared', 2014, during the press preview of the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, London. The prize is now in it's 30th year . Astill from OU: Finding Chopin 2012 by Tris Vonna-Michell, a nominee for this year's Turner Prize . Visitors viewing 'Rosebud', 2013, by James Richards, during the press preview of the Turner Prize exhibition at Tate Britain, London . Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. In 1999 Emin won the prize for My Bed, which featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts and condoms. Four years earlier Hirst\u2019s winning entry included a cow and a calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde. Damien Hirst\u2019s winning 1995 entry included a cow and a calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde . Winners have also included Grayson Perry\u2019s pots tackling subjects like death and child abuse, and Martin Creed\u2019s work featuring a light going on and off . Mr Campbell was presented with his award by 12 Years a Slave actor Chiwetel Ejiofor at a ceremony at the Tate Britain in London last night. Accepting his prize, Mr Campbell dedicated his win to his family including his parents and son. The artist joked: \u2018A friend of mine was reminding me recently about the poet W B Yeats, who, when a journalist phoned him to tell him about to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, the first question he asked was \u201chow much?\u201d. 'I already know how much. This money will make a huge difference to me.\u2019 In 1999 Emin won the prize for My Bed, which featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts and condoms . Previous winner artist Grayson Perry and his artwork 'Pot 1 - Mr Sh*t Sex' Other artists to be shortlisted for this year\u2019s prize included James Richards for his video featuring censored, erotic images from a book found in a Tokyo library. The Turner Prize 2014 exhibition runs to January 4 at Tate Britain in central London. Work by the nominees has been on show at the gallery since late September. Duncan Campbell, 41, was born in Dublin, and studied at the University of Ulster, Belfast. The film-artist now lives in Glasgow, where he graduated from the Glasgow School of Art as a Master of Fine Art. Campbell is the fourth graduate from the university to have won the Turner Prize in the last 10 years. Accepting the prize, Campbell paid tribute to his family, including his parents Paddy and Veronica, who watched the ceremony. He also spoke of his son, who was not able to be there.",

        "article": "By . Simon Tomlinson . PUBLISHED: . 05:18 EST, 10 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:19 EST, 10 January 2013 . The grandfather who helped his wife and five grandchildren escape . a Tasmanian bushfire by leading them to safety under a jetty returned . to his house to find it completely destroyed, he revealed today. Tim Holmes, 62, built his home himself but was helpless to save it as 'tornadoes of fire' swept through his village of Dunalley. As they became surrounded by flames, his only option was to shepherd his family into the sea, where they sought refuge for nearly three hours before fleeing in a dinghy. Hero: Grandfather Tim Holmes led his wife and grandchildren into the sea as a last resort as he watched the fires destroy the house he had built himself . They were later reunited with the children's mother, who feared they had all perished after hearing they had become trapped in the water. Mr Holmes said: 'It\u2019s all gone, every . last item, but it\u2019s a great sense of relief to think that we lost not . one hair on a child\u2019s head. 'All . the things that we've lost, yeah, there's some precious memories there. But they can be replaced, material things. 'But my . wife and children, not so easily replaced. Yeah, I just feel blessed . that my family's all together.' Speaking after their emotional reunion, the children's mother, Bonnie Walker, said she 'prayed like I . never prayed before' that her family would survive. She had left her children - Charlotte, two, Esther, four, Caleb, six, Liam, nine, and . Matilda, 11 - in the care of her parents on Monday as she had to attend a funeral. My little miracle: Bonnie Walker hugs youngest daughter, Charlotte, two, as she tells of her relief and joy that her family had survived the Tasmanian wildfires by taking refuge in the sea . My prayers were answered: Mrs Walker feared her family had all been killed after hearing they had been cut off by the fires that ripped through the town of Dunalley . Brave: Mrs Walker's children tell how the fire came at them in all directions leaving them trapped in the sea . Together again: Friends and loved ones embrace after the family's miraculous escape from the wildfires . But it was only after leaving the area she realised the marauding wildfires had swept into the village. Mrs Walker drove to the service in the capital Hobart as fire . ravaged the land either side of her and just made it through before the . flames crossed the road and cut her off from her family. Meanwhile, her husband, David, was hiking along Tasmania's southern coastline unaware of the unfolding drama. She told Australia's ABC network: 'We just waited by the phone and received . a message at 3.30pm to say that mum and dad had evacuated, that they . were surrounded by fire, and could we pray. 'So I braced myself to lose my children and my parents.' Mr Holmes told how he and his wife Tammy led their five . grandchildren into the sea as their only hope as he watched the house he had built himself go up in flames. Clinging on for dear life: Grandmother Tammy Holmes (second left) takes refuge under a jetty with her five grandchildren (l-r) two-year-old Charlotte, four-year-old Esther, nine-year-old Liam, eleven-year-old Matilda and six-year-old Caleb Walker. Mr Holmes took the picture as he feared their mother might not see them again . Escaping the flames: The family's pet dog Polly also sought safety on the jetty as the family huddled together in the water . Divine intervention: A building burns near the jetty. The family credits God with their survival from the fire that destroyed around 90 homes in their town of Dunalley as the country was hit with record temperatures . Even there, their . terror was not over as flames licked the wooden jetty they clung to and . they struggled to breathe in the smoke-filled air. With . the oxygen supply quickly running out in the polluted air, Mr Holmes 'rallied against all the odds' to retrieve . the dinghy from the foreshore. The ordeal was photographed by 62-year-old Mr Holmes, who . moved to Australia from Wales, as he feared his daughter my never see her children alive again. The iconic image of them huddling under the jetty has now been seen around the world. Mr Holmes said: 'We saw tornadoes of . fire just coming across towards us and the next thing we knew everything . was on fire, everywhere, all around us. 'By that time I had sent Tammy with the children to go down to the jetty because there was no escape, we couldn't get off.' Bracing themselves: The children prepare to enter the water to take refuge under the jetty as the wildfire rips through their grandparents' home . After . two and half hours in the water, he found a dinghy and ferried the . family to safety. \u2018We had water up to our chins and could barely . breathe, it was so toxic,\u2019 he said. Mr Holmes told how he sent his . wife, their grandchildren and pet dog Polly to the nearby sea jetty when . he saw smoke from the looming wildfire rise from a nearby ridge. Despite the arrival of three fire trucks, the 62-year-old realised he could not defend the home he had built himself. 'I looked at the firefighters and said, \"I have to go to Tammy and the kids\",' he told the West Australian. 'For . the next two-and-a-half hours, we huddled under the jetty as the fire . intensified and produced a plume of smoke, ash and debris that left us . with very little oxygen. 'There . were times when we had to move out deeper because it was too hot and . there were times when the jetty itself caught fire. I was able to scoop . some water onto the jetty and put it out.' Thanked God: The children's mother, Bonnie Walker, was unaware of the impending danger when she drove off to attend a funeral and feared her family had been killed when she heard of the devastation . They eventually made their way to safety as the fire burnt itself out. The family credits God with their survival from the fire went on to destroy more than 100 homes in the village. Mrs Walker said: 'I spent a lot of time with good friends and prayed like I've never prayed before and I think those prayers have been answered.' Meanwhile, it emerged today that raging bushfires in south-east Australia are heading towards an army range littered with unexploded bombs. The . blaze at Dean's Gap, in New South Wales, is just a kilometre away from . an area that the military used as a bombing range until the 1970s. Firefighters . are confident that they can stop the fires, which are the result of . soaring temperatures and protracted spells of intensely hot temperatures . that have been felt in all corners of the country. Fires continue to cause concern in western, central and southern areas, and Tasmania has been hit particularly hard. A large blaze is still burning out of control by the Tasman peninsula, near areas already hit by major blazes over the weekend. More than 20,000 hectares of land and 120 homes have been destroyed, but no deaths have been reported. VIDEO: Family tells of their incredible escape from wildfire .",

'It's no big deal': Nigel Farage,  standing for next year's Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket, has never revealed his German ancestry . The voters of South Thanet will decide whether Nigel Farage becomes a force in Westminster politics\u00a0 or remains on the periphery. Yet, despite a host of interviews over the past decade and a supposedly tell-all autobiography, Nigel Farage has yet to give them a full account of himself. For while it is well known that Mr Farage\u2019s wife Kirsten is German, the Ukip leader \u2013 standing for next year\u2019s Parliament on a no-unskilled-foreigners ticket \u2013 is yet to admit in public that he himself is the descendant of immigrants. Today, a Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that Mr Farage\u2019s grandmother, born Gladys Schrod, descends from German immigrants who fled to Britain in search of work and a better way of life. It\u2019s a secret he has kept close to his chest ever since his election to Ukip\u2019s leadership in 2006. In the many interviews the party leader has given in the past decade, he has never referred to his German ancestry. Neither do his ancestors rate a mention in his self-congratulatory memoirs Flying Free. Indeed, in the book he refers to his grandmother Gladys Schrod as having \u2018Georgette Heyer-style aspirations\u2019, apparently all very English, all very decorous. But in their three-bed semi in Beckenham, Kent, Gladys\u2019s father and Mr Farage\u2019s great-grandfather, Carl Schrod, a lowly Post Office sorter, is unlikely to have encouraged the upper-crust tales dispensed by Miss Heyer. He\u2019d grown up the hard way, living in rented rooms in the German quarter of\u00a0 London behind Tottenham Court Road \u2013 an area awash with refugees and prostitutes. Last year, in a confrontation with BBC political editor Nick Robinson, Mr Farage had the opportunity to set the record straight. Robinson drew attention to the fact that the politician\u2019s second wife, Kirsten, was born in Hamburg. Why, Robinson asked, did Mr Farage give the job of secretary to a German when it could have gone to a Brit? Mr Farage insisted that \u2018nobody else could do that job\u2019, which included checking emails for him at midnight. He might have added: \u2018Germans are very hard-working, as I should know \u2013 my people come from Frankfurt.\u2019 But he did not. So today, we supply the missing piece of the jigsaw which makes up the Nigel Farage story \u2013 the German connection. During the middle part of the 19th Century, emigration was a popular option among those who lived in the federation of German states (Germany did not become a country until 1871). Religious persecution, a sharp economic downturn and rising land prices were driving Germans from their homeland. Scroll down for video . Crowded: Immigrants fight for space in a rundown area of London in the late 19th Century. What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson's 'keep them out' rallying cry, one can only guess . Millions went to America, while others saw their future here. Nikolaus Schrod, Mr Farage\u2019s great-great grandfather, was a young cabinet-maker in Frankfurt. He married his sweetheart Bina at 21, but before starting a family he decided his shaky prospects would be much improved by moving to England. It was the 1850s, a time of rapid expansion and a new prosperity fuelled by the Industrial Revolution. Britain, then as now, was the land of promise. However, the benefits system had not been invented and those who fled to these shores came in the hope of a fair day\u2019s work for a fair day\u2019s pay. Panikos Panayi, professor of European History at De Montfort University and a leading expert on German migration, points to the large number of German musicians who\u2019d recently moved to London, bringing with them a wider appreciation of classical music and encouraging a broader culture among the educated classes. Their presence added a new zest to the capital\u2019s cultural life. Close ties: Kristen Farage (pictured), the Ukip leader's second wife, was born in Hamburg . Nikolaus Schrod made the cases\u00a0 for the pianos, upright and grand, which were becoming a must-have status symbol in every fashionable drawing-room, while Bina brought in\u00a0 extra money as a needlewoman and dressmaker. They lived in rented rooms in the teeming tenements close to the city\u2019s heart \u2013 close enough to the rich who employed them, but a world away. Existing on a minimum wage and living in near-poverty, both were skilled workers making a positive contribution to the life and comfort of the social classes above them. \u2018The British Government of the day was operating what was effectively an open-door policy on immigrants,\u2019 says Prof Panayi. \u2018And though many Germans who came to London in\u00a0 the mid-19th Century were largely ignored, these people [the Schrods] were skilled and will have been more positively received.\u2019 What Nikolaus Schrod would have made of his great-great-grandson\u2019s \u2018keep them out\u2019 rallying cry, one can only guess. After all, he and Bina came to Britain with no paper qualifications \u2013 in Nigel Farage\u2019s future Britain, they would be turned away. Yet in his short life \u2013 he died before his 45th birthday \u2013 Nikolaus was a model of what foreign labour can do to add to the wealth of the nation. He was no Roma camping on the streets but a man who worked so hard to make a new life for his family it sent him to an early grave. His only child, Carl, left school at 14 to become a telegraph messenger with the General Post Office. Carl later changed his name to Charles and married an English girl, Ellen Abbott. The Anglicisation of the family was completed in the next generation when their daughter Gladys married a young stockbroker\u2019s clerk, Harry Farage. It would appear, the family was always determined to improve itself \u2013 never\u00a0 asking for help, never expecting it. Harry was the first white-collar worker in what was to become a relatively posh family. By the next generation the Farages had found out how to make money in the City and went about it with gusto. Both sides of the family \u2013 Schrods and Farages \u2013 are a proud illustration of how a flexible labour market can reward both the labourer and the country as a whole. But Nigel Farage seems determined to deny the past in his juggernaut journey to fame. In May at the launch of the Euro election campaign in Yorkshire, he derided the \u2018mass\u2019 of people \u2018coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market in Britain\u2019 \u2013 doing, in fact, what his ancestors the Schrods had done. And \u2013 come to that \u2013 the Farages had done too. The surname Farage, according to its owner, is of Huguenot origin. The Huguenots were members of the protestant church in France who fled in their tens of thousands from religious persecution. As many as 500,000 left the country in the late 16th and early 17th Centuries, many of them settling in Britain. As with the Schrods, the Farages found no border controls, no Government immigration policy, no racial or religious prejudice \u2013 nothing, in fact, but a peaceful country which welcomed them and encouraged them to work and make the best of their lives. They did not\u00a0 need to bring with them sheets of paper\u00a0 listing their qualifications. When told that The Mail on Sunday planned to publish an article on his\u00a0 German ancestry, Mr Farage, said: \u2018I\u2019ve never made any secret of a variety of\u00a0 European links of the original derivation of my surname.\u2019 However, he admitted he had failed to mention his German ancestors on his mother\u2019s side, despite being questioned on\u00a0 a regular basis about his German wife. \u2018No, I haven\u2019t,\u2019 he said. \u2018There\u2019s no reason why I should, is there? Yes, it is true that\u00a0 my great-great-grandfather was of\u00a0 Germanic origin but he didn\u2019t come from Germany. Because when he came to the UK, Germany [as a single state] didn\u2019t even exist.\u2019 He added: \u2018On the basis of that, I\u2019m one-32nd German. \u2018I have a great-great-grandfather of Germanic origin. This is true. I don\u2019t regard it as a particularly big deal.\u2019",

        "article": "By . Nina Golgowski . PUBLISHED: . 09:59 EST, 31 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:09 EST, 12 February 2013 . Former president: Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, has been charged with sexually assaulting a young woman for the second time in three years . A former fraternity president has been charged with drugging and raping a woman in his second sex assault charge in just three years. Prosecutors say Edwin 'Kevin' De Boer, 26, spiked a woman's drink with a sedative during a date last November before taking her back to his apartment in Federal Way, Washington and having his way with her. Three years ago in 2009 De Boer was similarly accused of raping a woman at a University of Washington fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with to spare him from registering as a sex offender. De Boer pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment according to the deal, dropping a charge of rape. Today a second woman tells police that she consensually went out for dinner and drinks with him in Tacoma late last year but doesn\u2019t entirely remember how it ended, SeattlePi reports. The woman told police the last thing she remembers was sitting at a table with beer and appetizers before waking up naked and in pain in De Boer's apartment. She said she spoke with De Boer briefly before leaving his place and going to a nearby hospital for a sexual assault examination at the advice and help of her sister. The exam found she had ingested a potent sedative that causes amnesia. Photos also taken during the exam backed her claim of rape. Previous crime: In 2009 De Boer, right, was accused of raping a woman at a fraternity house where he was president, a charge he struck a plea deal with finding him instead guilty of harassment . New charge: In November a woman says she went on a date with De Boer, second from right, but blacked out half-way through before waking up to find herself naked and in pain . When the woman asked De Boer what happened, he denied giving her any sedative but admitted to sexually assaulting her, according to police. The woman told police she had never blacked out before and did not plan on having sex with De Boer during their date together. During their date the woman claims De Boer had briefly mentioned another woman he had been seeing while president of his fraternity but who had 'gone crazy' on him. In July of 2009 that possibly same woman, a 21-year-old, accused him of raping her during a fraternity party after a series of advances by De Boer that were unsuccessful. The woman told a court that after several shots of liquor De Boer first tried making out with her on the steps of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity house but was turned down. Attack: In July of 2009 a 21-year-old accused the former Phi Kappa Theta president of raping her inside the room of their fraternity house, pictured . Punishment: De Boer was removed from University of Washington's fraternity following the 2009 charge, the campus pictured, while also given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service . She said he later pulled her into a room and demanded oral sex from her. When she refused he allegedly pushed her onto a bed and raped her. A detective told a court that De Boer claimed the woman only changed her mind while they were already having sex. He later said she was just upset that he didn't take precautions to ensure she didn't get pregnant. 'The defense counsel and I together interviewed 11 witnesses,' the detective later told a court according to Seattle Pi. 'None of the witnesses saw [the woman] kiss, touch or show any interest in Mr De Boer, so it appears that Mr De Boer is not being truthful.' The allegations presented before an \u2018administrative hearing\u2019 involving fraternity members and alumni led to De Boer\u2019s removal from their fraternal chapter. De Boer was given a suspended sentence, probation and ordered to 15 days of community service following the plea deal. Today he faces a second-degree rape charge over the November report. He has been jailed on $300,000 bail while pleading not guilty to his current charges.",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Visitors to the Los Angeles Police Department website have identified five women depicted in photographs found in a suspected serial killer's home this summer, but police need to independently confirm those claims, spokeswoman Norma Eisenman said Friday. Authorities would not say whether those women are alive or dead, Eisenman said. A website displaying the photos received 10 million hits in 24 hours after police asked for assistance in naming more than 100 women depicted in 180 photos, which police released Thursday, Eisenman said. Some women were featured in more than one picture, police said. Police have also received more than a dozen phone calls since releasing the photos, they said Friday. Authorities want to know whether a serial killer known as the Grim Sleeper has more than the 10 murder victims that police are now alleging. \"We are grateful for the public's response to the release of the images,\" a statement said. \"It is our fervent hope that with this response, coupled with the tireless efforts of our detectives, the women depicted in these images will be positively identified.\" In July, 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was arrested and charged with 10 murders and one attempted murder dating to 1985, and Los Angeles police spent hundreds of hours sifting through thousands of photographs, Polaroids and videotape found in Franklin's house. The bodies of victims, many working as prostitutes, were all found in close proximity to each other in a neighborhood formerly known as South Central Los Angeles. Franklin, a mechanic who once worked for the LAPD, was arrested in July after police say they matched his DNA with DNA left on some of the victims. Police were led to Franklin after his 28-year-old son got arrested and gave a DNA swab, authorities said. Authorities said they narrowed the confiscated images down to 180 photographs. At a news conference Thursday attended by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief Charlie Beck, authorities said they had difficulty determining whether some of the women were alive or dead in the photos. \"We cannot tell,\" Beck said. \"Obviously, as all of you can see, some of them are animated, and some are not. It's impossible to tell by the photographs. Robbery Homicide Detective Dennis Kilcoyne said police have a responsibility to try to determine the whereabouts of the women. \"These are clearly photos of women that Mr. Franklin had contact with,\" Kilcoyne said. \"We have a responsibility to identify these women. They may be alive and well, but we need to be certain. \"If there's nothing we glean from this, we are able to fill in the timeline of Mr. Franklin's life, and that's one of our goals as well,\" Kilcoyne said. He declined to talk about the context in which the women's images appeared. \"The lifestyle or the situation that these women are in would defeat our plea with the public,\" Kilcoyne said. Police are not sure where the women in the images resided, because Franklin's movements throughout his life are not yet ascertained, authorities said. \"His travel habits are unknown to us,\" Kilcoyne said. \"We believe he spent the majority of his life right here in the city of Los Angeles.\"",

        "article": "(CNN) -- We are in the middle of a fight to preserve the dignity and grace that makes all of us Americans. We have big hearts and great souls. I know. I have seen them, felt them and watched them in wonder when my family was lost and unreachable in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. I cried, worrying for those I loved, heartbroken by what happened to our beloved Louisiana. And in the middle of that tough moment, the decency of people shone through in e-mails, phone calls and in person. Everybody was saying the same thing: \"How can I help?\" This is what we do in times of struggle. We offer our hand and our love to pull someone up who's been knocked down by hard times and despair. It's just a fundamental rule in life and in any fight; you don't kick people when they're down. But for some reason, this principle has been lost on the 217 members of the House of Representatives who decided to lace up some combat boots with rough, crushing soles to kick and kick again the 48 million Americans who count on food stamps. I am not going to mince words. When the House voted to cut $40 billion to the food stamp program over the next 10 years, that wasn't an example of government tightening its belt or making tough choices. That vote wasn't a philosophy or an ideology about governing. Pure and simple, it was a heartless act. It was cruel. It was kicking millions of our families, neighbors and friends when they are down. And the people who work for a living in this country are down. Let's take a walk through the facts of what's happened to them during the Great Recession and this nonrecovery of the economy. The median family net worth dropped from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, according to the Federal Reserve. It gets worse. Median family income fell from $49,600 in 2007 to $45,800 in 2010. (These are the latest available figures). \"The Fed (Federal Reserve) found that middle-class families had sustained the largest percentage losses in both wealth and income during the crisis, limiting their ability and willingness to spend,\" according to The New York Times. For 30 years, wages have flat-lined or declined for most workers, particularly in the past 10 years, as low-paying jobs replace middle-income paying jobs. In 2009, only half of the country had any assets, and those numbers have gotten worse during the last three years. And here's the kicker. Today -- based on wage levels -- half of Americans live in poverty or near poverty.  The gap between the well-to-do and everybody else is widening alarmingly. Probably everyone reading this knows someone who is striving mightily, working two jobs and cutting expenses to the bone while barely making ends meet. To be considered poor by federal standards, a family of four must make less than $23,550 a year. A person must make less than $11,490. For the unemployed and the millions who have been looking for work for six months or more, the struggle is many times harder and uglier. Ask any worker at Starbucks, Cosi, McDonald's or Walmart, \"How many jobs do you have?\" and likely he or she will tell you: \"Two.\" I know colleagues who've had breakfast at one store, and gone to lunch in another, only to find the same person waiting on them. One young woman I heard about gets up at 4 a.m. for her first job and ends her day at 10 p.m. at her second job. The average allotment of food stamps is $133 a person a month. Let me tell you something I can pretty much bet my house on -- that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar. She's quietly going to the food pantry, checking the sales in the grocery store, spending some time at the kitchen table clipping coupons and making a serious plan to turn that box of pasta, pound of beef, and if she's lucky, some fresh fruits and vegetables, into a meal plan truly worthy of a Gucci belt. Is there fraud? Yes. Is there some waste? Yes. But today, the food stamp program has an error rate of only 3% -- and those errors were mostly committed by the government in underpayments as well as overpayments and payments to ineligible families. Fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program. And those few bad apples who do commit fraud are no excuse to kick the unemployed and the poor when they are engaged in a mighty battle to get themselves and their families back on their feet. So shame on this Congress for fighting dirty during working people's hour of struggle. Polls show Americans haven't approved much of Congress lately. But there is a way to gain favor. If this Congress wants to make cuts, why not look at the Pentagon, notorious for waste? Or check out the Department of Agriculture, which made about $28 million in inappropriate farm assistance payments, according to a compilation of government waste reported in Business Insider. Or perhaps lawmakers could start with themselves? Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, tried to shame her colleagues into cutting less from the food stamp program (called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP). Speaking of representatives who would vote to take food from America's tables, she said, \"Some of these same members travel to foreign countries under the guise of official business. They dine at lavish restaurants, eating steak, vodka and even caviar.\" Speier talked about 20 members of Congress who traveled to Ireland and got a daily food allowance of $166. The average amount a family member gets on food stamps is less than $4 a day. And The Des Moines Register reported that Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, received $3,588 in taxpayer funds for both food and lodging during a six-day trip to Russia. The Register urged King to try the \"SNAP Challenge\" and live on $4 a day. He could even try it in Russia. Yet our representatives, one after the other, mostly Republicans, stepped onto the House floor to speak and vote in the name of saving money for the taxpayer. They went after the poor, the unemployed, the single mom, the single dad, the grandparents -- all those people who are trying to make it work. Well, they didn't just do wrong; they are wrong. I urge the Senate to restore every single dime to the food stamp program. I applaud the president for saying that he'll veto these cuts. We're lacing up our shoes, too, but we're going to fight these merciless cuts with the golden rule. You know why? \"Do unto others\" trumps \"kick 'em when they're down\" every time. The American people are decent and fair. It's time to stand tall for this essential program for millions. It's time and our might will make this right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.",

The CIA is part-funding a $600,000 study to find out whether it can control the weather using geoengineering. It is backing the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) study to investigate whether geoengineering - such as solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal - could be used to curb the effects of climate change. According to NAS, the study will look at 'a limited number of proposed geoengineering techniques' and is funded by the CIA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as well a NASA, The Independent reported. The CIA is part-funding a $600,000 study to find out whether they can control the weather using geoengineering - perhaps stopping dramatic weather such as this lightening storm in Chicago . The purpose of the study is to look 'generally on the potential impacts of . deploying these technologies, including possible environmental, . economic and national security concerns,' according to the NAS website. The CIA told U.S. news website Mother Jones: 'It's natural that on a subject like . climate change the Agency would work with scientists to better . understand the phenomenon and its implications on national security.' Geoengineering is a controversial idea . that involves the deliberate and large-scale intervention in the Earth's climatic . system with the aim of combating global warming- in this case to change the weather. One of the techniques, solar radiation management is purely theoretical at the moment. The idea is to reflect sunlight in a bid to block infrared radiation, which some scientists think could stop temperatures rising. There has been much speculation over the years as to whether the U.S. government is interested in geoengineering and has set its sights on manipulating the weather, according to The Independent. Weather manipulation is a particularly contentious in the U.S. after commentators have claimed that huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as Oklahoma (pictured), were actually deliberately made by the US government using the Harrp antenna in Alaska . There are claims that it has controlled the weather before, including rumours that they tried to cloud-seed during the Vietnam war, by spraying substances into the air to produce artificial clouds that resulted in rain or snow. It has been reported that the Chinese government has seeded clouds in territories that were suffering severe droughts, to force it to rain. It was claimed that they also seeded clouds ahead of the 2008 Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing to divert rain to other places. They also reportedly fired iodine crystals into rain clouds over the city to ensure that inclement weather did not ruin the big event. Weather manipulation is presently particularly contentious in the U.S. after commentators accused the government of deliberately creating huge tornadoes that devastated cities such as Oklahoma. They claim that the huge weather events were conjured up using the Harrp antenna park in Alaska. China has previously made artificial rain (pictured) in northern provinces to fight a severe drought as well as reportedly at the Beijing Olympics to ensure a sunny ceremony .",

Prince William and Kate's arrival in Singapore has handed the Pacific isle an opportunity to showcase to the world its stunning transformation from struggling island nation to glittering urban metropolis. Thirty years ago the country was flexing under the weight of urban overcrowding, poor living conditions, political corruption and a severe lack of infrastructure. But over the last 20 years, sweeping urban regeneration schemes have seen the country blossom into an oasis of modernity with constantly-sprouting skyscrapers and mechanical forests of solar-powered 'supertrees'. However, while many have hailed . Singapore's makeover an economic miracle, critics say the sparkling . lights and glass facades mask a reality of government control and social repression. Modern symbol: The \u00a3350m man-made 'Supertrees' in Singapore's the Gardens by the Bay have come to symbolise Singapore's ascent as one of the world's economic powerhouses and home to trend-setting urban innovation and design . Today the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the Gardens By The Bay on the second day of their Diamond Jubilee tour of south east Asia and the South Pacific. The park is a massive \u00a3350million development in the city's Marina Bay area, and home to Singapore's newest spectacle - an imposing canopy of artificial trees up to 50 meters high spread across 250 acres. It, along with the dozens of lavish hotels, towering skyscrapers and rooftop infinity pools, has come to symbolise Singapore's ascent as one of the world's economic powerhouses and home to trend-setting urban innovation and design. Design spectacular: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visit the Bay South Garden, the first and largest of the three planned gardens at the Gardens by the Bay project . Gardens By The Bay: The park is a massive \u00a3350million development in the city's Marina Bay area, and home to Singapore's newest spectacle - an imposing canopy of artificial trees up to 50 meters high spread across 250 acres . However, draconian laws in the Pacific Rim isle make male homosexuality punishable by two years behind bars, . gatherings of over five people require an official permit - and outstaying your visa can result in at least three strokes of the cane. In . 1992, chewing gum was ruled illegal after authorities decided too much . was being stuck on pavements and wedged under public seats on buses and . trains. Today, gum importation is banned unless a user can prove it has a medicinal value. Pornography and littering both carry . hefty fines while the unauthorised use of a wifi internet connection is . considered hacking and can land an offender behind bars. Behind the sheen: But while many have hailed Singapore's makeover an economic miracle, critics say the sparkling lights and glass facades mask a reality of government control and social suppression . Banned: In 1992, chewing gum was ruled illegal after authorities decided too much was being stuck on pavements and wedged under public seats on buses and trains . Singapore's media environment is also highly . regulated. Censorship is common, internet access is regulated and . private ownership of satellite dishes is not allowed. Withing the Gardens By The Bay park, the towering structures, stretching 50 . metres into the sky, have giant steel and concrete trunks and thousands . of thick wire rods for branches. Fitted with solar panels, hanging gardens and rainwater catches, the trees will be used to display plants from across the globe. A vast green space is also to be created in the area under plans to make Singapore the 'botanical capital of the world'. The park will house a cluster of green conservatories and . will also become home to the Singapore Garden Festival. Visitors can take in a panoramic view of the gardens via an aerial walkway, dubbed the OCBC Skyway. The walkway, which links the artificial trees, is suspended 22 metres above the ground - about seven storeys high. City leaders want to create a continuous ring of greenery, with three gardens wrapping around the Marina Bay area. Perhaps the most controversial issue . for human rights groups are antiquated defamation laws that are accused . of heavily curtailing freedom of speech and expression. Kate Allen, UK Director of Amnesty . International, told MailOnline: 'Singapore has a modern image but is in . the Dark Ages when it comes to dealing with critics and others who fall . foul of the law. 'The government uses restrictive laws . to silence its critics, bringing criminal defamation cases against them . and censoring the media.' In 2010, British author Alan Shadrake was jailed, charged with . contempt of court for his book, Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which criticized the . Singapore judiciary\u2019s use of the death penalty. In his book Mr Shadrake accused the courts of bowing to diplomatic and economic pressure when deciding how to dispense justice. He claimed the courts favoured the wealthy and abused the law to suppress political opponents. He was jailed for six weeks before his immediate deportation. The government says restrictions on speech and assembly are . necessary to preserve economic prosperity and racial and religious . harmony in this multi-ethnic city-state of five million people. But according to Ms Allen, 'It has rejected calls to repeal laws . allowing detention without trial and caning has been imposed for some 30 . offences, including immigration violations.' She added: 'Recently Amnesty International welcomed a move to end mandatory death sentencing for drug trafficking and homicide cases but called for mandatory death sentencing for all crimes to be abolished.' The country's vast regeneration is said to have begun in earnest in 2001. By 2005, gambling was legalised in a bid to spark a surge in tourism, . paving way for the construction of two multi-billion dollar casino resorts. Vast sums of money was pumped into government regeneration schemes and more skyscrapers and hotels were built. Banned: In 2010, British author Alan Shadrake was jailed, charged with contempt of court for his book which criticized the Singapore judiciary's use of the death penalty . Its reputation as a business-friendly market helped attract increased overseas investment and its old problems of urban overcrowding, poor living conditions and a severe lack of infrastructure began to fade. Singapore now has the world's highest percentage of millionaires, with one . out of every six households having at least one million US dollars in . disposable wealth. The country is also the world's . fourth leading financial centre, the world's second-biggest casino . gambling market, one of the world's top three oil refining centres, the . world's largest oil-rig producer, and a major ship-repairer.",

        "article": "By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 16:01 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:50 EST, 14 November 2013 . The remains of a former Brazilian president have been exhumed for tests almost four decades after he died to determine whether he was murdered. It has long been thought that Joao Goulart, known as Jango, died of a heart attack in exile in Argentina in 1976. But digging work to remove Mr Goulart's body from his grave in Sao Borja, Brazil, began on Wednesday morning after a Uruguayan intelligence officer claimed that he was poisoned by spies working for the country's military government. Exhumed: Joao Goulart's remains are to be examined to discover whether he died from natural causes or was poisoned . Tests: Forensic technicians stand next to the grave of former Mr Goulart before the exhumation of his remains, in Sao Borja . Mr Goulart had ruled in Brazil from 1961, but was overthrown in a military coup three years later. He initially fled to Uruguay but later moved to Argentina after he was invited by then-president Juan Peron in 1973. The progressive leader, who was known to have left-wing sympathies, died in December 1976 in Mercedes. His death came months after Peron's widow Isabel was overthrown by a military junta. No post mortem was ever carried out in either Argentina or Brazil where he was buried. Officials said he had died of a heart attack. Last resting place: Photographers take pictures of Mr Goulart's grave before digging began on Wednesday morning . Respect: A team of forensic experts, federal police and members of Brazil's Human Rights Ministry stand around the grave . But Mario Neira, who had been jailed for drug smuggling, alleged five years ago that Jango had been poisoned at the request of Brazilian military rulers. He claimed that the plan to kill Mr Goulart, codenamed Operation Condor, was a collaborative effort between governments in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Neira alleged that spies swapped Mr Goulart's heart medication for tablets that triggered a cardiac arrest. Back home: The former president, known as Jango, was buried in Brazil despite fleeing the country after he was ousted in a military coup in 1964 . Guard: Policemen stand guard at the cemetary where Mr Gualago was buried . Now his claims are being investigated by Brazil's National Truth Commission. Mr Goulart's body will reportedly be taken to Brasilia for tests before an official ceremony is held as he is the only former Brazilian president to be buried with out full honours. According to the BBC, the commission said in a statement: 'Today we will open a new chapter in the tale of mystery which has surround the death 37 years ago of the former president. 'The exhumation will put an end to the anguish of his family and thousands of Brazilians who have sufficient reason to believe that his death did not occur spontaneously, as stated in the death certificate - which was issued without a prior post mortem examination.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Here at an international gathering of Japan specialists currently underway in Ljubljana, Slovenia, the actions of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in honoring his country's war criminals have come in for sharp criticism. Nobody attending the European Association of Japanese Studies conference seems surprised, but I have yet to meet anyone who thinks Abe has done Japan any favors. One attendee suggests that, in sending a personal message to a ceremony commemorating Japan's war criminals, Abe has yet again handed a strategic gift to China and South Korea, while making Japan look churlish about its war responsibility. Another said that if Chancellor Angela Merkel made a similar gesture repudiating the verdicts against Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg, her political career would end and Germany would face strong condemnation and isolation in Europe. So yet again Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has scored an own goal on history through sending a message to the ceremony, held at the sacred site of Koya-san in the mountains of Wakayama in April this year. 'Foundation of the fatherland' The site is the heartland of the Shingon sect of Buddhism and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The ceremony is held annually at the Okunoin cemetery, where there is a statue inscribed with the names of 1,180 war criminals, including the 14 Class-A war criminals enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The statue was erected 20 years ago with the explicit objective of restoring the honor of these war criminals and honoring their sacrifice \"for the foundation of the fatherland.\" An inscription on the statue decries the punishment of war criminals by the Allied powers as \"a harsh and retaliatory trial never before seen in the world.\" Abe's message was read out at the ceremony on April 29 this year, but only came to light this week. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press conference that the message was not sent in Abe's capacity as prime minister, and as such the government would not comment on it. According to Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun, Abe's message stated: . \"I would like to sincerely express my feelings of remembrance to the spirit of the Showa era martyrs who staked their souls to become the foundation of their nation so that Japan could achieve the peace and prosperity of today.\" Defenders of Japan's wartime conduct commonly use the phrase \"Showa era martyrs\" -- which refers to the period of Japanese history corresponding to the 1926-89 reign of Emperor Hirohito -- to refer to the war criminals. This is how they are described at the Yushukan Museum on the grounds of Yasukuni Shrine, the talismanic site for those who seek to glorify Japan's devastating war of imperial aggression in Asia from 1931 to 1945. It is not the first time Abe has sent a message for the Koya-san ceremony. Last year, he wrote: \"I want to establish the existence of a new Japan that would not be an embarrassment to the spirit of the war dead.\" Perhaps, but many living Japanese are embarrassed by his efforts to burnish Japan's wartime record. 'Disingenuous' excuse . Abe's spokesman said that his statement, and offerings at Yasukuni Shrine twice this year, were made in his private capacity. Apparently Abe is under the illusion that he can call a timeout as Japan's political leader whenever it suits him. This is disingenuous, but a dubious sleight of hand that Japan's leaders often invoke when trampling on the dignity of Japan's wartime victims. World leaders don't get to declare timeouts. Although most Japanese don't share Abe's enthusiasm for Japan in jackboots, Brand Japan suffers from Abe's revisionist views because he is the nation's leader 24/7 and the world scrutinizes all of his words and gestures. By showing a lack of contrition about the horrific suffering Japan inflicted on much of the rest of Asia, Abe has inflamed tensions with China and South Korea, and left Japan even more isolated. Tokyo's friends in Washington cringe every time Abe lets loose one of his boomeranging salvos on history. Like most Japanese they wonder why Abe can't just stick to Abenomics and leave history to the historians. There are good reasons why Japanese are proud of what Japan has accomplished since 1945 in promoting peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific. But by trying to rehabilitate an era when Japan ran amok in Asia, Abe keeps everyone's focus on Japan's embarrassing 20th century misadventures. Abe insists that his door is \"always open\" for dialogue with China and South Korea, but his knack for slamming it in their faces by trying to airbrush the past keeps Japan isolated in northeast Asia. What is he thinking? Why would Abe make such a gesture, given the predictable consequences for Japan's regional relations? It is not just myopia that explains Abe's blunders. Abe is waging a culture war to redefine Japanese national identity, one that he thinks is way too masochistic. He wants to nurture pride and patriotism among Japanese and, for him, that means revising history. Abe is a true believer and his gestures are a message to his political base that he has not given up the fight to overturn the postwar order imposed by the US, including what he views as the unjust verdicts handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, aka the Tokyo Trials. Earlier this year he caved into US pressure to pledge he would not overturn the 1993 Kono Statement in which Japan acknowledges its responsibility for the comfort women system, having earlier made noises that he might do so. Washington is eager to get its two Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, talking again, but this been difficult because Abe's revisionist views on history deeply offend Koreans. Abe's reassurances about the Kono Statement was the minimum necessary to convince President Park Geun-hye to agree to meet with Abe and President Barack Obama in the Netherlands on the sidelines of a nuclear proliferation summit. Chilly reception . But Abe's minor concession got a chilly reception in Seoul. He is known there for his apologist views about the comfort women system and quibbling about the level of coercion used in recruiting tens of thousands of young women to serve as wartime sex slaves for the Japanese armed forces. Moreover, a month after signaling he would not repudiate the Kono Statement, Abe sent his message praising the war criminals. And his supporters in the Diet proceeded with an investigation of the comfort women system aimed at discrediting the Kono Statement, a damaging hit-and-run attack aimed at sowing doubts among Japanese who are showing signs of perpetrator's fatigue and the burdens of war responsibility. The attack was also red meat for Abe's reactionary base. Abe's defiant and unrepentant attitudes towards history are unlikely to change enough to satisfy the neighbors. But will they continue to cold shoulder Japan? President Park is under a lot of U.S. pressure to get over the past so that plans to jump-start a strategic dialogue next month might proceed. But a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the November APEC summit in Beijing now looks more difficult due to Abe's actions, which ensure that Japan's wartime past continues to cast a long shadow into the 21st century.

        "article": "Disgruntled: Atlon Nolen was allegedly angry about not getting a raise at work before he attacked . The Muslim convert accused of beheading a colleague in Oklahoma has reportedly told cops he felt oppressed at work - particularly over not getting a raise. Alton Nolen, a 30-year-old production line employee for Vaughan Foods in Moore, was fired on Thursday after getting in trouble for his performance and for trying to convert colleagues to Islam, officials told\u00a0CNN. On Monday, law enforcement officials were preparing to file a murder charge against Nolen for walking back into Vaughan Foods after being fired and allegedly beheading 54-year-old grandmother Colleen Hufford. He then allegedly began attacking 43-year-old Traci Johnson before being shot by Mark Vaughan, the company's chiefoperating officer who is also a sheriff's deputy. Johnson is expected to recover, while Nolen  underwent surgery and is also expected to survive. Authorities waited until he was coherent and could . understand the charges before placing him under arrest on Friday . afternoon, they said. He is also expected to face a charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the stabbing of Johnson. The FBI is also looking into . Nolen's background for any  religious ties to the . attack after  colleagues said he had attempted to convert . them to Islam. Police said Nolen had recently become a Muslim. The FBI investigation comes as Islamist militants fighting . in Iraq and Syria have released videos that purported to show . the beheadings of two Americans and a British aid worker. Scroll down for video . Scene: The  production line worker was fired from Vaughan Food in Moore, Oklahoma on Thursday before returning to the business to attack the first two people he came across. The scene is pictured on Thursday . On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life. Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. On Sunday, a woman who said she was Nolen's mother took to social media . to apologize to the victims of the attack. 'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in a . Facebook post. 'My son was raised up . believing in God. I want to apologize to both families, because this is not . Alton.' Attack: Nolen, pictured left, allegedly beheaded one colleague before stabbing Traci Johnson, right . Convert: 30-year-old Nolen, who shared photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters to Facebook, is believed to have converted to Islam in prison before being released earlier this year . Megan Nolen, the suspect's sister, said in the same video . that Alton was not a violent person. Nolen's family members have said also that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them. 'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.' As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion. 'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press. Nolen had a non-violent criminal record, including drug-related arrests, a jail escape and resisting police,authorities said. But it emerged that Nolen  served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. Heroic: He was only stopped when CEO and sheriff's reserve Mark Vaughan, pictured, shot him . He went to prison March 10, 2011 to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported. He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - but due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. He was released on March 22, 2013, records show. 'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday. 'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.' Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado. Her neighbors described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.",

        "article": "(CNN)  -- An e-mail from one of the crewmen aboard the Maersk Alabama tells a gripping tale of sailors fighting back against pirates who had taken over their ship. Crewman Matt Fisher hopes other ships can learn lessons from the Maersk Alabama takeover and recapture. It also contains some of the lessons they learned and hope to pass on to others who could face the same danger. Crewman Matt Fisher sent the e-mail to a fellow sailor aboard another Maersk ship. The U.S.-flagged Alabama was already heading to Kenya when he sent it, but it was before the U.S. Navy rescued the cargo ship's captain, who was held hostage on a lifeboat by the four pirates. \"The pirates got up to the bridge very quickly once they were onboard,\" Fisher wrote. \"We had a locked cage door over the ladder well from main deck, but it only took a second for them to shoot it off. They then got to the bridge up the outside ladders.\" Fisher said that Capt. Richard Phillips and three other sailors were on the bridge when the pirates arrived, adding that he didn't know why they stayed.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa \u00bb . The rest of the crew, Fisher said, headed below and took positions in the engine and steering areas. One sailor kept watch in the engine control room, he said, while another \"was out on deck tracking the pirates' movement.\" \"We kept swinging the rudder side to side,\" Fisher wrote. \"The pirates' boat capsized, though I'm not sure exactly when or what caused it. After about 20 minutes, the engine was killed, I don't know by whom.\" After the engine was killed, the sailors shut off the power to the ship as well as the fuel line to the ship's emergency diesel generator. \"I think this was critical,\" Fisher wrote. \"The pirates were very reluctant to go into the dark.\" Fisher said the sailors were safe where they were, since the pirates had no grenades and would never have been able break through with only firearms. The only problem, he said, was the heat and a shortage of water. \"In the future, we will store food and water in various spots for emergency usage,\" he said. \"I think we will also run a fresh water line into the steering gear.\" Fisher said the sailors were able to sneak up to the engine room water fountain and filled some bottles, and the sailor who'd been on deck tracking the pirates dropped fruit and sodas from the ship's galley through a standpipe to the hidden sailors. At one point, Fisher wrote, the pirates sent one of the four sailors who had remained on the bridge to hunt for the other crew members -- unescorted. He escaped and joined his comrades. Later, one of the pirates escorted another sailor into the engine room, again searching for the missing crew members, but one of the sailors \"was able to jump him in the dark and we took him prisoner.\" \"No one else came down into the E/R (engine room),\" he said. \"As the day went on, the pirates became desperate to get out of there.\" Phillips finally talked the pirates into taking a small boat used for rescuing a sailor who falls overboard. The three remaining pirates and the captain went down into the boat, and the sailors, now in control of their ship again, dropped food, water and fuel to them. But the small boat wouldn't start. The sailors on board the ship dropped the lifeboat into the water and took it -- and their prisoner -- to the stranded boat with the pirates and the captain, intending to trade boats and prisoners. \"We were supposed to exchange their guy for the Captain, but they ended up keeping him,\" Fisher wrote. \"They motored off in the lifeboat. They had no way of getting back aboard, so we followed them.\" A few hours later, the USS Bainbridge arrived on the scene.  Watch crew arrive in the United States \u00bb . \"We stayed close by for some time, but then the Navy asked us to head out,\" Fisher said. \"I heard that several other pirate vessels were heading our way and the Navy wanted us out of the way. That's about it.\" Eventually, Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the pirates aboard the lifeboat. Phillips was freed, and the remaining pirate was taken prisoner. But the Maersk Alabama, with U.S. Navy protection aboard, was nearing Mombasa, Kenya, by that time. At the end of his e-mail, Fisher went over the what the Alabama's crew had learned. \"Have a well-fortified location with food and water supply. Kill all the lights. Leave the alarms going, the noise helped cover our movements through the house. Flashlights and radios are very handy, as well as the sound-powered phone.\" \"It was a pretty stressful situation,\" Fisher wrote. \"I have to say I am impressed with how the entire crew responded. We didn't have anybody who wanted to give up.\" Fisher also said he was \"pretty confident\" that his captain would come out of the ordeal \"OK.\"  Watch Capt. Phillips arrive in Kenya \u00bb . \"They have to know that if they kill him they'll be done,\" he said.",

Meth addiction: Valley Park Mayor Nathan Grellner is also under fire for his expenses . A town mayor has been exposed as a meth addict after he skipped public meetings for five months. Nathan Grellner, the leader of Valley Park Missouri, claimed he had exhaustion when he checked himself into hospital for three days last month. But\u00a0St Louis Today today revealed that he had been treated for methamphetamine abuse and referred to a chemical dependency unit. The revelation comes after Grellner was earlier arrested for driving while intoxicated but escaped from hospital after he was left unguarded. It also follows a string of suspicious behaviour by Grellner, who used his city credit card to spend thousands of dollars at strip clubs when he was supposed to be attending meetings and on power tools to renovate his home. Grellner said he confused the city credit card because he was 'not in a state mind' where could distinguish between the two. He spent $575 on a Bosch shop vaccum, $2,500 on a washer and dryer, and also bought a miter saw and a hammer drill. The mayor also spent moe than $2,000 in restaurants and bars including $2.39 on a McFlurry at McDonald's and an $80 tab at TJ Wings Family Pub. The receipts also showed he was at a strip club when he was supposed to be attending town meetings. His treatment for meth addiction on June 8 came two days after he was arrested by police for driving intoxicated and resisting arrest. Grellner was taken to a hospital by police who where doctors said they 'weren't sure what all may be in his system,' according to St Louis today. But he was left unguarded and escaped before checking into Centerpoint Hospital in Wheldon Springs two days later. Strip clubs: Grellner also visited strip clubs when he was due to be at town meetings and bought power tools on city expenses . Small town: Valley Park is a town of 6,00 people in St Louise County, Missouri . Grellner is already facing a vote of no confidence over his expense claims and his apparent drug use is set to enrage voters. Alderman A.J. Levinson - who has also been arrested for driving while intoxicated - said voters were asking whether the town was 'paying for [Grellner's] partying.' Other local politicians were shocked at the drug abuse revelations. Alderman Laurie Henderson said: 'I'm speechless. I don't know what my reaction is.' Valley Park is a town of 6,942 people in St Louis County, Missouri.",

A senior Italian politician is facing calls to resign after likening the country\u2019s first black Cabinet minister to an orangutan. Roberto Calderoli, vice-president of the Senate \u2013 Italy\u2019s upper house \u2013 and a leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, made the remarks about immigration minister Cecile Kyenge at a party rally. \u2018When I see images of Kyenge I cannot help think, even if I don\u2019t say that she is one, of a resemblance to an orangutan,\u2019 he said. For most of the day, Calderoli said he had no intention of resigning and offered only a qualified apology. \u2018I did not mean to offend and if . minister Kyenge was offended I am sorry, but my comment was made within a . much broader political speech that criticised the minister and her . policies,\u2019 he said. But after hours of nearly universal . condemnation and extensive coverage by the international media, . Calderoli called Kyenge in the evening to apologise directly. She had done well to become a minister, he said, but \u2018perhaps she should do it in her own country\u2019. Miss . Kyenge, 48, is a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since . 1983 and became a minister in April. She declined to comment on Mr . Calderoli\u2019s remarks. Prime . Minister Enrico\u00a0 Letta has denounced the comments as \u2018unacceptable\u2019 and . \u2018beyond every limit\u2019. And several ministers said Mr Calderoli should . step down from his Senate position. Politicians, including some from his own party, lambasted Calderoli, with some calling for him to resign as Senate vice president. In an official statement and on Twitter, Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the comments were unacceptable. \u2018They go beyond all limits. Full solidarity and support to Cecile. Forward with your and our work,\u2019 Letta said. \u2018I just spoke with minister Kyenge and I apologised,\u2019 Calderoli told state news agency Ansa. Racist slur: Calderoli also said immigration minister Cecile Kyenge, pictured, should 'be a minister in her own country, and was later forced to apologise . Kyenge . is campaigning to make it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship, . and she backs a law that would automatically make anyone born on Italian . soil a citizen. Last month, . a Northern League member in the European parliament was expelled from . the eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group for making racist . remarks about her. Mario Borghezio had attacked Kyenge for wanting to impose \u2018tribal traditions\u2019 in Italy as a member of a \u2018bonga bonga\u2019 government, an apparent play on the so-called \u2018bunga bunga\u2019 parties of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Opposition politician Calderoli, twice a cabinet minister under Berlusconi, has often caused offence. In 2006, he was forced to resign as reform minister after displaying a T-shirt mocking the Prophet Mohammad during a state news broadcast. The same year, after Italy won the soccer World Cup, he disparaged the opposing French team, which he said had lost because its players were \u2018niggers, Muslims and communists\u2019. Before Calderoli's apology, Kyenge told AGI news agency he should think of his responsibility as a senior Senate member. \u2018I don't want to address Calderoli the person, but as a representative of an institution: reflect on what you want to represent through your language,\u2019 she said.",

        "article": "By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A beauty therapist who went abroad for a bargain boob job was horrified when the implants burst through her skin just days later, nearly killing her. Claire Hawker, 30, had been recommended the cosmetic surgeon in Prague by a friend and was initially delighted with her new figure. But just days after returning home, her size G breasts started leaking a brown discharge and suddenly burst. Scroll down for video . Claire Hawker was nearly killed by a boob job she had abroad after developing a raging infection . Ms Hawker before the breast enlargement (image right, pictured right). The mother-of-two said her confidence was at an all-time low because her breasts were sagging and different sizes, with one a B cup and one a C . After being rushed to hospital, surgeons warned the mother-of-two she would die if the implants were not removed immediately. \u2018I remember feeling scared then angry when I was told my implants would have to be taken out - but I had no choice,' says Ms Hawker, from Reading. 'I had wanted bigger boobs for almost a decade because they had really sagged after having children. My  confidence was rock bottom.' While one breast was a 34B cup, the was other a C - and both began to droop following the birth of her daughter, Jasmine, at 17. \u2018Working in the beauty industry it was important to me to look good and feel confident, though I hadn\u2019t for a very long time,\u2019 said Ms Hawker. \u2018I would look in the mirror and feel so self-conscious about that part of my body. I wished my breasts could be bigger.\u2019 But as a single mother, she couldn't afford expensive cosmetic surgery. 'It got to the point where my appearance was affecting how I felt at work, though. As a beauty therapist it was critical I looked and felt good, but my clothes hung on me like a sack of potatoes.\u2019 Then in July 2008 a friend who\u2019d had liposuction at a cosmetic surgery in Prague recommended the clinic to Ms Hawker. After researching the clinic online, she discovered she could have a breast uplift and implants for \u00a32,300 \u2013 a third of the cost she would pay in the UK. Friends and family also backed her decision to go abroad, so she took out a loan for \u00a34,000 to cover flights and expenses. Video courtesy of Tariq Ahmad Practice . She was also unhappy with her uneven breasts (left) and hoped surgery would sort the problem out. But even a week after surgery in Prague, she was in agonising pain (right) 'A year later as I got on the plane to Prague, I was so excited about having the body I'd always dreamed of,' she said. After five days exploring the city, Ms Hawker met the surgeon who would perform her procedure. She said: 'The receptionist at the clinic explained the surgeon didn\u2019t speak much English, so I should show him photos of what I wanted. \u2018But I assured myself he knew what he was doing and I showed him some magazine clippings of celebs with size G breasts, like I wanted.\u2019 However on waking up two hours after the op, she was in total agony. 'My breasts were bandaged up so I couldn\u2019t seem them and there was pain shooting through my chest. 'I told my friend I thought I was going to die.\u2019 The next day, her bandages were changed again before she was discharged - still without having seen her new breasts. Surgeons told Ms Hawker her  implants were too big. This had ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected . Even as she boarded the plane home the day after, her breasts continued to ache and she took some tablets the surgery had given her to ease her suffering. 'I figured I should expect some pain following surgery, so I did my best not to worry,' she said. Back home, she spent the following few days slumped on the sofa, barely able to move her arms for the pain. But a week later, despite still being bandaged up, she decided she was ready to visit the salon where she worked to show her mother and colleagues her new breasts. As she lifted her top however, she noticed her bra was damp and a brown, smelly discharge was leaking from her left breast. \u2018My mum said she could see my implant poking out of a 50p sized hole in my skin, which had burst open.\u2019 After being rushed to Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, a surgeon examined her breast. As he did, the skin under her right breast split too. \u2018He said my implants were too big and they\u2019d ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected. 'They had to be removed or I would die.' He added she was the fourth person he'd seen that week who's been the victim of botched cosmetic surgery abroad. Later that day Ms Hawker was taken in to theatre to have her implants removed and she spent the next week having the infection washed out of them. 'I spent two weeks in hospital and regretted going overseas so much,' she said. 'It really hadn\u2019t been worth it.\u2019 Even after being discharged, Ms Hawker had to return every two weeks for the next year so that nurses could clean her wounds and check her breasts were healing. But nothing can repair her confidence, which is now even lower, having been left with small breasts and horrific scarring. She said: \u2018My breasts looked even worse than before and I worried even if I got new implants, the skin under them would always look like I\u2019d been burnt. \u2018At least the uplift I\u2019d received overseas hadn\u2019t gone wrong, so my breasts looked alright when I wore strappy tops. \u2018But I continued to miss the fullness my new breasts had given me and my confidence, at work and going out with friends, and I felt at an all-time low.\u2019 She was told she would have to wait at least two years - and until she\u2019d made a full recovery - before she could have further surgery. Though it would cost her thousands - and she was still paying off her loan for her original surgery, Ms Hawker said she couldn't stay the way she was. Then in May 2013, she spotted a magazine ad recruiting people for a documentary about botched cosmetic surgery called Botched Up Bodies. In return they\u2019d receive free corrective surgery. Last year Ms Hawker underwent further surgery in the UK to correct the damage and enlarge her breasts again . She said: 'Having this surgery changed my life. I\u2019m more confident now and love receiving compliments. I just wish I hadn't risked my life the first time for cheap cosmetic surgery' Ms Hawker said: \u2018I was anxious about appearing on TV but my mum encouraged me and I decided it was worth it to get the body I wanted.\u2019 At Royal Welbeck Hospital, in London, a leading cosmetic surgeon Dr Nick Percival, from Cosmetic Surgery Partners, examined her and recommended an E cup. On the day of her surgery last June she admits feeling nervous. 'But when I came round hours later - not in any pain and with new 34E breasts - she was thrilled. Then in November, she had a second procedure to remove the scar tissue she\u2019d lived with for three years. She said: \u2018Having this surgery changed my life. I\u2019m more confident now and love receiving compliments. \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t been so eager before to have cosmetic surgery. I should have researched my options and saved up to have it done in the UK. \u2018Instead, going abroad almost cost me my life. It\u2019s not worth risking it for cheap cosmetic surgery.\u2019",

        "article": "This is the shocking moment a pair of violent thugs raided two off-licences after battering shop workers over the head - with bottles of alcohol. CCTV taken from separate raids in Walsall, West Midlands, show the men first walking into the store before picking up wine and vodka. They then approach the counter appearing to be about to pay before launching their brutal attack by smashing the shopkeeper over the head with the glass bottles. Scroll down for video . Two thugs were captured on camera using bottles of alcohol to batter shop workers over the head during two terrifying robberies . One of the robbers can be seen raising up his arm and brandishing a bottle of alcohol (circled in red) during one of the violent raids on two off-licences in Walsall, West Midlands . On both occasions one of the men raids the till while the other continues to rain down powerful blows leaving terrified staff cowering in fear. West Midlands Police released footage of the vicious attacks which took place on May 26 and June 2 and left one cashier with head injuries. Officers are appealing for any witnesses to get in touch after the CCTV was also aired on BBC's Crimewatch. Detective Constable Gerry Maley, from Bloxwich police station, said: 'Despite numerous inquiries in the area and appeals to the public, we are yet to identify the pair in the images. On both occasions, the men can be seen approaching the counter appearing to be about to pay (pictured) Violent: After pretending they wanted to purchase alcohol, they are seen using the glass bottles to attack the till attendants . A raider wearing a blue cap (pictured) is captured on CCTV in one raid grabbing hold of a till . In another raid, the men are able to open the lock on a till before escaping with hundreds of pounds in cash . CCTV captured the moment one of the raiders launch a bottle at a shop assistant before one of them, wearing a blue cap (pictured), leaps onto the desk . 'Someone, somewhere will know who they are and we're hoping that by showing these pictures on Crimewatch, we'll be able to appeal to a wider audience and get that one call we need to identify the men.' The first attack happened at the Convenience Store off licence, on Glyn Avenue in Moxely, Walsall at about 10.40am on May 26. The one minute 46 second clip first shows a stocky bald black man in a grey hoodie walking up to the counter with a bottle of red wine . He then launches it straight at the till worker while another man - wearing a black hoodie - runs behind the desk and pushes the shop assistant to the ground. West Midlands Police released footage of the vicious attacks which took place on May 26 and June 2 and left one cashier with head injuries . On both occasions, one of the men raids the till while the other continues to rain down powerful blows leaving terrified staff cowering in fear . The second robber is described as an Asian or light-skinned black man, and is around six feet tall with a slim build. The pair then fumble with the lock to the till before opening it and escaping with hundreds of pounds in cash. But before they flee, the man in the black hoodie picks up two more bottles of vodka, and launches one at the store worker. The second robbery took place at a News & Booze, on Wednesbury Road in Darlaston, Walsall, at 10.10am on June 2. Two men can be seen entering the store, and the shorter of the two, wearing a dark hoodie and sunglasses, picks up a bottle of white wine and approaches the counter. Police have released CCTV footage of the two men (pictured left and right) in the hope witnesses will come forward . The bottle is again  thrown at the shop assistant, as the second raider wearing a blue cap, leaps onto the desk. This time the till attendant tries to fight back after grabbing a wooden pole - but after making a run for the shop door, he is overpowered by the two thugs. The man in the cap then goes behind the counter, rips out the till drawer, and the pair flee the scene. Anyone with information is asked to contact West Midlands Police on 101 or via Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.",

        "article": "By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 20:49 EST, 22 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:53 EST, 22 November 2012 . An eccentric Texas millionaire has been accused of sexually abusing eight teenage boys. Stanley Marsh 3, who is famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field in the name of art, is facing a raft of lawsuits alleging he supplied the boys with cash, cars and alcohol in return for sexual favours. The lawsuits also claim the millionaire's wife, Wendy Marsh, and business partner David Weir, knew of the abuse and covered it up. Lawsuit: The eccentric Texas millionaire, Stanley Marsh 3, pictured left, has been accused of sexually abusing eight teenage boys and wife Wendy, right, allegedly knew about it . Mr Weir allegedly went as far as to force the boys to sign a waiver regarding his colleague's behaviour while they were in the office as employees or guests. Mr Marsh, who inherited his grandfather's oil and gas fortune and previously owned TV station KVII, is set to challenge the claims, which label him as a 'serial abuser' in court, according to The New York Times. The boys, aged 15, 16 and 17 at the time, are charging sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress and are suing the 74-year-old for unspecified monetary damages. Amarillo police have interviewed six of the plaintiffs and searched Mr Marsh's offices, removing certain items, as part of a criminal investigation into the alleged abuse. Cadillacs: Mr Marsh is famous for burying 10 vintage Cadillacs nose-down in an Amarillo field, pictured . Mr Marsh's lawyer Kelly Utsinger told The Times his client was cooperating with the police. 'Any suggestions about the truth of these allegations needs to be reserved until the evidence is fully developed,' he said. 'We will file responsive pleadings that challenge and deny these allegations.' Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s. The bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen song a decade later which only boosted its popularity. He is also known for owning a pig with tattooed wings on its sides. The city's residents are giving their millionaire neighbour the benefit of the doubt and not letting the allegations taint his mechanic masterpiece. Memorable: Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s . 'I think most people in Amarillo appreciate it as a work of art, and really don't think of it in the context of its donor any more than people concentrate on whatever Van Gogh's psychological problems were in appreciation of his art,' State Senator Kel Seliger, a Panhandle Republican and the city\u2019s former four-term mayor, told The Times. 'One should always take allegations of indecency with a child seriously. But at this point they are just that, they're allegations.' But the allegations aren't the first he's faced relating to youngsters. Nearly 17 years ago, he was arrested on charges of kidnapping and aggravated assault after he was accused of threatening a high school student with a hammer and locking him in a chicken coop. He paid a $4,000 fine and the assault and kidnapping charges were dropped.",

Sad story: The ewe was found in Greenleaf, Idaho, earlier this month in a field where she had been left for more than five days without food or water . It was unclear how long the sheep's coat had been left unsheared. She was also suffering from hunger and dehydration. Now she's improving daily and will be looking for a new home when she's given the all-clear by vets. The sheep was found west of Boise, and her owner has not been identified. They will likely be charged with animal neglect. Sheriff's Lt. William Adams says that sheep need regular shearing so they can move freely. Workers at the Canyon County Animal Shelter told KBOI-TV that it took three people almost an hour to 'to cut her free from her wool shackles' On the mend: Now the sheep, nicknamed Dolly, is improving daily and will be looking for a new home when she's given the all-clear by vets . He says it was obvious the ewe, since nicknamed Dolly, hadn't been properly cared for. 'Being a domestic sheep like that it needs to be regularly sheered so it can get the extra weight off it so it can move freely,' he added. 'In this instance the sheep was not cared for and caused it to lose mobility.'",

A human foot still wearing its athletic shoe washed onto a San Francisco beach Sunday morning. A black size 11.5 Puma sneaker contained the extremely decayed remains and no signs of the rest of the body were found. National Park Service personnel found the foot after a beachgoer called to report the gruesome sighting. Scroll down for video . Horror: This Puma containing a decayed human foot was found on a San Francisco beach Sunday. No sign of the rest of the body was found . 'What we have is a human foot, with some associated tissue, inside of a shoe,' Mark Powning, an investigator with the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, told the San Francisco Chronicle. The find at the city's Ocean Beach, while gory, is not all that uncommon. According to SFist, at least 13 or 14 such feet were found in the Pacific Northwest between 2007 and 2012. One theory about the origin of the feet--and their lack of a body--is that the shoe somehow protects the foot from being eaten or fully decomposing. Long gone: The gruesome discovery was made at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. Experts say the foot was likely rolling around on the ocean floor for a long time . As the body decays, the foot may detach and float away, eventually washing onto shore. This can even happen many years after death. Two feet that came ashore in 2011 were traced to a suicide in Vancouver from seven years prior. Mark Powning suggested something similar in the case of the San Francisco foot. 'It probably was rolling around the seabed for awhile,' he said.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Racing at the Daytona International Speedway can be like playing the lottery against 42 other drivers who all have a ticket, all seem to have an equal shot at winning. While luck can certainly help, so does experience, something Jimmie Johnson put to use as the laps wound down in NASCAR's season-opening and most prestigious race of the season. Johnson won the Daytona 500 on Sunday, edging out Dale Earnhardt Jr., who finished second for the third time in four years. Johnson, who won the race for the second time, led 17 laps on the track where speeds are limited by a restrictor plate. The result is close racing, with cars separated by hundredths of a second. It's a race that often involves a big wreck near the end, so Sunday drivers were content to line up one by- ne and go around and a round and around for the first 180 laps. Then Johnson took over. \"I had a lot of confidence leading the train,\" Johnson said of being the first car in line as drivers raced around the 2 1/2-mile track. \"I knew I had a fast car.\" Bleacher Report: Johnson finds way to win . His crew chief, Chad Knaus said that despite the uncertainty of racing this season with the latest generation of NASCAR cars -- which are lighter and sleeker -- they knew for weeks what they wanted to do. \"Jimmie did a great job of following that plan,\" said Knaus, who sat out the team's 2006 Daytona 500 win because of a suspension. Bleacher Report's snap reaction . Danica Patrick, the first woman to win the pole position at the Daytona 500, led three times, including five laps under green -- also becoming the first woman to lead a lap at the race not under a yellow flag caution. She finished eighth, the highest finish ever for a female driver at the race. \"At the end of the day, it was a solid day,\" she said. \"We stayed basically in the top 10 all day, so it was nice.\" Crew chief Tony Gibson beamed after the race. \"She did great under pressure,\" he said. Bleacher Report: Danica Patrick proves her chops . Earnhardt did his best to earn his second win in the \"Great American Race,\" but his last-lap charge came up short. With just over a mile to go, Earhardt, followed by veteran driver Mark Martin, went low on the track. With Martin's car pushing Earnhardt's the two pushed into contention, but Johnson maneuvered in front of his teammate Earnhardt. The 54-year-old Martin crossed the finish line third. \"We just kinda ran out of steam out of (turn) four,\" Earnhardt said. \"We made a good move, but there just was not enough race track.\" Some of the fans who were injured by flying debris Saturday during a crash late in the Nationwide Series Drive4COPD 300 were to attend the Daytona 500, speedway president Joie Chitwood said Sunday morning. At least 28 fans were injured when more than a dozen cars piled up in the final curve of Saturday's race. Some of the debris went over a 22-foot-high fence that was built in 2010, and some of it went through holes as the fence was mangled when a car slammed into it and bounced back onto the track. Saturday's wreck occurred when several closely packed cars were jostling for position at top speeds of about 175 mph. They got tangled up, setting off a dangerous chain reaction that ensnared several vehicles. Driver Kyle Larson's vehicle ended up flying into a fence that separates the track from spectators. The car broke into pieces, including tires and a fiery engine. Larson walked away from the crash, even after the front part of his No. 32 car was gone. He and the other nine drivers involved told reporters that they were checked at a medical tent on the Daytona infield and released.",

Moyes. who was sacked by the Red Devils in April after less than a season in charge at Old Trafford, was given a tour of the Basque club earlier this week and held talks on Friday. Spanish newspaper AS now claim that Moyes has decided to relaunch his managerial career with Sociedad but Sportsmail understands that he remains unsure about taking the job and is set to make a decision on Sunday. Former Manchester United manager David Moyes was given a tour of Real Sociedad on Friday night . Moyes' reign at Old Trafford lasted just 10 months as the Scotsman failed to get the best out of his players . Sociedad, where Wales manager Chris Coleman was once in charge, have turned to Moyes after a disastrous start to their La Liga campaign which has left them with just six points from 10 games. But the potential at a club which gets regular gates of 24,000-plus and was in the Champions League a year ago might be enough to persuade Moyes he has found the right opportunity to start again. He told Sportsmail recently: \u2018I\u2019d like to find a job, if I can, that gives me a chance of being successful. \u2018I have always felt it could enhance me as a manager to go abroad, so that is a possibility.\u2019 Real Sociedad are looking for a new manager after\u00a0Jagoba Arrasate was relieved of his duties . Former Real Sociedad boss Chris Coleman believes Moyes should accept the La Liga side's job offer .",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- It's that time of year again: You can't open a paper or click online without being subjected to April Foolery, from hard-to-swallow hoaxes to nearly-believable news. So did you spot the spoofs? Check out our favorites, and nominate your top tricks in the comments. They may be the biggest boyband in the world, but Britain's Daily Mirror says that won't help One Direction's plans to tour North Korea -- unless, that is, Harry Styles and co. are willing to swap their super-styled locks for Kim Jong-un's short-back-and-sides hairdo. The paper says that with the band unlikely to meet his demands, Kim is launching an \"X Factor\"-style search for the North Korean equivalent, \"Un Direction.\" Financial woes aren't normally a joking matter, but the UK's Sun newspaper reports that the Queen has found a novel solution to boost the monarchy's income: fracking in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Other British papers see the upcoming vote on Scottish independence as ripe for giggles, with the Guardian revealing that, should Scots back a break with the rest of the United Kingdom later this year, the nation plans to show its solidarity with mainland Europe by switching to driving on the right. The paper says a newly-independent Scotland would scrap its current road signs, ditching \"the famous road sign font known as 'Transport' with a new Celtic-tinged typeface, 'Proclaimer'.\" And street signs aren't the only thing set to be dumped: The Daily Telegraph reports that, should his campaign succeed, pro-independence leader Alex Salmond will replace the Queen on Scottish coins, with the currency to be known as the \"Salmond Sterling.\" The Independent, meanwhile, announces that the U.N. is drawing up plans to send in peacekeepers in the event of post-independence tensions between Scotland and England. Quoting unnamed sources, the paper says the U.N. is concerned a \"Yes\" vote could result in \"pre-arranged 'face-offs,' modelled on the film 'Braveheart,' between rival militias who it is feared could travel to towns such as Gretna Green and Berwick-upon-Tweed for weekend showdowns.\" The Daily Mail reports that those south of the border are also making plans for life after a split, with \"secret government papers\" revealing just what the Union Jack would look like without the blue and white Scottish flag, known as the saltire. In Australia, there is news that Hollywood bigwigs had found inspiration for the latest big-screen biopic down under, with former Prime Minister John Howard set to be immortalized on film. The New Daily said the movie, which had been given the working title \"Man of Steel,\" was backed by The Weinstein Company, which also supported Margaret Thatcher movie \"The Iron Lady.\" The site claims Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins were vying for the role of cricket-loving PM Howard, with Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey lined up to play former U.S. President George W. Bush, and Meryl Streep in the running as Howard's wife Jeanette. It isn't just newspapers -- companies were in on the April Fool's act too, with carmaker BMW posting an advert for its latest product, the BMW ZZZ Series -- a high-performance baby crib. And Amazon has reportedly bowed to pressure from old-school book fans keen to combine the convenience of an e-reader with the smell of real books: behold the Kindle Paperscent. The device, a faux-leather cover which wraps around the e-book, is reported to use the same technology as that in room scent diffusers -- and comes with a choice of old and new book smells. British baker Warburtons took to its Facebook page to announce plans for what would surely be the best new offices since sliced bread -- two toast-shaped tower blocks situated either side of London's famous Swiss Re tower -- dubbed the \"gherkin\" by locals -- creating a skyscraper sandwich on the city's skyline. And if that wasn't enough to whet your appetite, Australian breakfast spread Vegemite -- known around the world as an acquired taste -- unveiled a new energy drink, iDrink2.1, suggesting fans of the distinctive flavour \"Swap your Vegemite toast for this when you're on the go.\" Talking of being on the move, London's Docklands Light Railway revealed plans to make commuters' lives more fun, by adding a loop-the-loop section in the Canary Wharf business district. CERN, home of the Large Hadron Collider and some of the world's smartest scientists, picked April 1 to debut a whole new look, announcing that from now on the organization's website, and all its official communications, would be presented in Comic Sans font. In a statement on its website, scientists at CERN announced that they would change its image by adding a Justin Bieber selfie to its logo; it also plans that in future \"especially important physics results [will] be accompanied online by animations of little clappy hands.\" So which April Fool's Day efforts do you think are worthy of applause?

        "article": "A district attorney has decided against charges in the case of a police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man more than a dozen times in Milwaukee. The officer, Christopher Manney, killed Dontre Hamilton during a confrontation in April. The officer says he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney has since been fired for not following protocols, but he will not be charged. \"I've come to the conclusion that criminal charges are not appropriate in this case, and I am releasing all of the information related to this investigation so that you, the public, can see all the facts related to this decision,\" Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm told reporters Monday. In a report, he wrote that the officer's use of force was \"justified self-defense and that defense cannot be reasonably overcome to establish a basis to charge Officer Manney with a crime.\" Chisholm anticipated that some might be upset with his decision and, in fact, protesters took to the streets Monday night. According to local media, the officer is white; Hamilton was black. \"On a human level, of course it's tragic. Anytime I have to tell a family that I can't bring justice to them when one of their loved ones has died, it's always tragic. It's terrible,\" Chisholm said. \"The reason that our job is unique is our obligation is not to tell people necessarily what they want to hear. We have to follow our ethical obligations and the law, and sometimes that's very difficult ... But it's a privilege to be able to do the job, and we're committed to doing it the right way,\" he told reporters. Following Chisholm's announcement, the U.S. Department of Justice said that it would conduct a federal civil rights review of the case, which comes amid ongoing protests around  race and law enforcement in America. \"There is a lot of media trying to fit this incident into the national conversation, but it is important to note that the individual who was shot was not unarmed.  He was armed with the officer's baton at the time that he was shot,\" said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer of the Milwaukee Police Department. Earlier this year in Ferguson, Missouri, a jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, a white officer who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager. Charges were also not filed in the death of Eric Garner, a black man, who died in Staten Island, New York, after an officer put him in a chokehold.",

        "article": "By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, a double amputee, has revealed that she is pregnant. The 46-year-old Iraq veteran, who lost both of her legs and suffered serious injuries to her right arm while serving in 2004, announced she and her husband will welcome a baby girl in December. 'Bryan and I are expecting!' she wrote on her Facebook page on Monday. 'Thank you for your support and kind words during this exciting time in our lives.' In a segment on the Today show on Monday, Duckworth revealed that she 'went through all the different varieties of IVF' before conceiving and admitted it was hard to keep the process quiet. Good news: Iraq veteran and Illinois Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth, pictured left and right with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey, has announced that they are expecting their first baby - a girl - this December . The baby girl will be her first child with husband Bryan Bowlsbey, whom she met at George Washington University and married in 1993. He is a Major in the National Guard. Due to her age, her pregnancy is considered high risk, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Duckworth was flying a Black Hawk helicopter over Iraq on November 12, 2004 when she was shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade, losing both of her legs and shattering her right arm. After returning to the U.S. and learning how to walk with the help of prosthetics,\u00a0she worked for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and as the Director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs between 2006 and 2009. She was elected to Congress in 2012. Service: Duckworth is pictured serving with the Illinois Army National Guard during her tour of duty in Iraq. In 2004, she lost both legs when the helicopter she was in was shot down on a mission near Baghdad . Fighter: She is pictured wearing her Purple Heart medal at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2004 . Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to an American U.S. Marine Corps father, is the first disabled female veteran and the first female Asian American from Illinois to serve in the House. She is also one of five female veterans who lost limbs in Iraq and, coincidentally, four of them are pregnant or recently gave birth, the Today show reported. Melissa Stockwell, who lost most of her left leg from a roadside bomb in 2004 before going on to compete in the 2008 Paralympics, also appeared on the show. Her son is due in November. 'Tammy and I as being lower limb amputees I think very initially wondered if it would be possible to have children and learned pretty quickly you can still have children and provide, but I think you have to find yourself first,' Stockwell said. Band of mothers: On Monday, she appeared on the Today show with fellow veteran amputees, Melissa Stockwell, left, who is also expecting a baby, and Dawn Halfaker, right, who gave birth four months ago . They appeared on the show beside Dawn Halfaker, who lost an arm in Iraq, and who is now mother to a four-month-old boy. Then finally, Danielle Green-Byrd, who lost an arm during combat in 2004 before helping vets with PTSD, gave birth to a son 10 days ago. 'These women were there for me as the band of sisters when I went through the greatest pain, the greatest trauma in my life,' Duckworth said. 'And now we get to be together for the time of greatest joy.' See below for video .",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 02:21 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:09 EST, 26 February 2014 . Thirty-one of the passengers who were aboard the ill-fated February 2013 Carnival Triumph voyage turned cruise from hell are looking for compensation for their pain and suffering in a civil case that began last week. Emotions were high in the Miami courtroom as passengers took the stand to describe the five days adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with very little food, sewage-filled decks and near total darkness at night. 'I think about the smell, the stench and the bad things. All the memories come flooding back, and I can't stop them, testified 74-year-old Jean Cripps, who like the rest of the plaintiffs says the experience left emotional marks that have remained in the year since the headline-grabbing cruise. Nightmarish: Passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, feces-covered decks and overpowering stench . 'I did not get physically injured. I got mentally injured,' said Cripps, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and whose husband is diabetic. 'The whole experience never ends...It's over and over again.' According to CNN, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham made a sweeping ruling prior to testimony that Carnival is indeed responsible for the fire that left the cruise helpless and adrift. 'It is highly likely that Carnival was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be (sic) attributed. Here, the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence,' Graham wrote. However, the judge also ruled that the passengers, per their agreements with Carnival, were not guaranteed a safe cruise and therefor the company was not in breach of contract. Nevertheless, the passengers will . continue to testify to the extent of their emotional distress and . injuries for at least another week in an attempt to convince the judge . they deserve compensation from Carnival. Those . include testimonies like the Cripps', who emphasized an extreme fear of . physical injury during the debacle--not least of all because Alton . Crisp went without his diabetes medication for days--and other . passengers' with less tangible but far more stomach-turning flirtations . with disaster. Carnival failure? The Carnival Triumph was anything but after a fire knocked out power and left 3,000 passengers without power, with very little food, and fearing for their lives in some cases . Suffering after a year: Now 31 passengers have filed a civil suit against Carnival and want compensation for the emotional trauma some of them say they relive even now, a year later . Like Fleda Key, who described having terrible diarrhea on the already feces-covered ship and the distinct lack of usable toilets. 'There was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one,' said the 68-year-old. '(I) choked away the smell...I was fearful, downright afraid and scared.' 'I walked through water and feces and urine, no telling what else,' Key's daugher Michelle Key agreed on the stand. 'We would slip and slide through greasy, gross, slippery muck.' Like many of the passengers, the Keys said they feared they wouldn't make it home alive from the trip. Houston-based plaintiff's attorney Frank Spagnoletti said each passenger should receive anywhere from $30,000 to $1 million in compensation, depending on the severity of their injuries. 'There's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured, and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this,' he said in his opening statement. Miami attorney Curtis Mase, representing Carnival, said the claims of injuries are overblown. 'There are a number who I believe deserve nothing. And I will tell you this, the one or two that I can think of who have significant injuries, they're very much in the minority and there are only one or two,' Mase said. Steep: The attorney representing the plaintiffs said they're asking for between $30,000 and $1 million for each of the 31 passengers . Inhumane conditions: Passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways .",

        "article": "By . Sam Webb . The picture, of four Chinese officials meeting a 103-year-old woman in her home, was probably meant to convey the impression of a government in touch with the masses. The image, from Ningguo in eastern China, even bore the caption: 'Love and consideration for the elderly is a cherished Chinese tradition. They should feel the warmth of the party and the government.' However, the media stunt backfired spectacularly as the image was an ineptly edited montage that exposed all involved to ridicule from China's increasingly vocal online commentators. Utterly bizarre: This poorly manipulated image was released by Chinese officials keen to highlight their concern for the elderly . A close-up of the manipulated area. The woman looks like a doll and the officials torso hovers in mid-air . Four grinning men tower above centenarian Cheng Yanchun, who has obviously been edited into the photo from another image but appears almost doll-sized. One of the party officials has been chopped off at the thigh to incorporate the image, leaving him bizarrely hanging in mid-air. Chinese users of Weibo, a micro-blog site, were not impressed. 'The brainless propaganda staff will probably be sacked along with these officials,' said one. Another added: 'This picture really shows the distance between leaders and commoners in the eyes of your average government official. Very sad and depressing.' Another photo of the visit: The government has apologised for the picture, saying the photographer had struggled to get everyone at the event into the frame . Even Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, put the boot in. 'The officials appear to be floating in the air. In addition the woman\u2019s proportions do not match those of the officials indicating that the photo may have been faked,' it reported. Officials told The Honk Kong Standard that they had visited centenarians during a Chinese festival, but an employee had merged two shots because the layout of the room had prevented the photographer from capturing the woman and the officials in the same frame. 'Cheng was sitting on a chair on the balcony, under the sun. The balcony space was very small and the camera lens could not cover the whole scene\u2026 When the employee of the municipal civil affairs department uploaded the photos \u2026 he simply merged two shots,' the government said. 'We express deep regret to internet users for its negative influence\u2026 We will learn from the experience, to improve civil affairs work.' Photoshopped : This clearly doctored picture, published last year, showed three Chinese officials proudly showing off their newly laid road . Spoof: A number of viral pictures have appeared around the world showing the three Chinese officials in various locations .",

        "article": "Barring a late injury scare, Gareth Bale is all set to join an elite list of Britons plying their trade abroad to line up in a Champions League final. It's a monumental moment for the Real Madrid winger, who has enjoyed a season to surpass the expectations of most after his \u00a386million world-record transfer from Tottenham. Twenty-one goals later and Bale is really showing why the club splurged so much money on him in September. The 24-year-old is ready to start for Carlo Ancelotti's side against city rivals Atletico in Lisbon on Saturday night and here, Sportsmail looks at the seven other Brits abroad who've had the pleasure of playing in Europe's showpiece fixture. Inspiration: Paul Lambert (challenging Didier Deschamps) was superb for Dortmund in the 1997 final against Italian giants Juventus . Paul Lambert - Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus (1997) The Scotland man bossed midfield for Dortmund during his solitary season in Germany and immediately became a cult hero with supporters. Not hard to see why really. The Aston Villa boss assisted one of the goals and nullified the threat of a certain Zinedine Zidane, who was just starting to become a real influence on the world stage. Lambert is still talked about over there. In typical straight-talking style, he said: 'I gave the shirts I swapped with the Juventus players after the game to my dad,' he reflected. 'But he's a roof-tiler, wore them to work and they're ripped to pieces. As for the medals, they're round the house somewhere, I don't know where. 'But all the experience that came with winning them is up here [in the mind].' Steve McManaman - Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia (2000) Definitely a midfielder whose talents have now been largely forgotten, but McManaman in his pomp - the run up to his move to Real Madrid and immediately after - was one of the country's more frightening wingers. And he can lay claim to having scored in a European Cup final. Operating centrally, McManaman was at his sublime best. The goal was a stunning volley . Madrid swept Valencia aside at the Stade de France, and it was in part down to the brilliance of the Scouse lad they signed from Liverpool a year beforehand. That's about as good as it got for him. Absurd really that McManaman never truly kicked on after that night in Paris. What a hit! Steve McManaman scored a super volley and was named man of the match against Valencia . That was the one: The Liverpudlian enjoyed his finest night in football at the Stade de France in May 2000 . Owen Hargreaves - Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 pens) (2001) One of those nights where the English press stood up and wondered who this scrawny midfielder - eligible for the national team - was, completely bossing a Bayern Munich midfield. Next to the legendary Stefan Effenberg, keen to banish the nightmare final moments of the 1999 final against Manchester, Hargreaves shone. He had been key in the semi-final win against Real Madrid weeks previously, while the Canadian went on to star at the World Cup in 2002 for Sven-Goran Eriksson. Coming of age: Owen Hargreaves was exceptional for Bayern Munich in their run to the 2001 final . Steve Archibald - Barcelona 0-0 Steaua Bucharest (0-2 pens) (1986) Joined Barcelona in 1984 from Tottenham and Archibald started brightly at the Nou Camp. By the time 1986 came around, he wasn't a regular but did play in the final under Terry Venables. Archibald played a key role in defending from the front in the goalless draw but had been substituted before the penalty shootout. Laurie Cunningham - Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool (1981) Cunningham is one of the most exciting players to have ever graced the English game, tragically dying in a car accident while at Ray Vallecano in 1989. The winger started his career at Leyton Orient but truly made his name at West Brom before a move to Real Madrid. He was electric for the Spanish giants, but - on the biggest club stage of them all - Cunningham wasn't able to impact on the final. A shame: Steve Archibald wasn't able to add a European Cup winners' medal during his Barcelona career . Struggle: Laurie Cunningham (tackled by Liverpool's Graeme Souness) wasn't able to impact upon the final . Chris Waddle - Marseille 0-0 Red Star Belgrade (3-5 pens) (1991) You could hardly blame him, but when offered the opportunity to step up for Marseille in the final's penalty shootout, Waddle turned it down. After all, it was under a year since that night in Turin when the former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder blindingly smashed over the crossbar at the 1990 World Cup. Kevin Keegan - Hamburg 0-1 Nottingham Forest (1980) His final season over in Germany almost looked like ending perfectly, but Hamburg inexplicably came unstuck against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. Keegan - much like the favourites - never got going at the Bernabeu and left the club for Southampton that summer. He knew the final was to be his last game, but still it ended in a damp squib. Head in hands moment: Chris Waddle watched his Marseille side lose on penalties at the end of the 1991 final .",

There are only four days until the first shoppers get their hands on an iPhone 5. But for those who have pre-ordered, they can watch their phone make its way slowly from overseas from China, with crates stacked high with iPhones due to land in both the U.S. and UK by the end of the week. Fans have been using the UPS delivery company's website to figure out when their phone will arrive, and by doing so have shown that that the first shipments left ZhengZhou in China yesterday. If people still want more information, then Apple has released detailed specifications about the phone, to allow third-party manufacturers to create cases for the phone. Waiting for your iPhone 5? This is what you will be getting: Apple has released these specifications of its new device . The specifications show every individual measurement of the iPhone - from the width of the lens to the spaces around the buttons. This means that third-party case-makers can get to work creating different covers for the phone, and a rush of covers are now likely to start appearing on eBay and other merchant websites. Apple states its design aims and warnings to manufacturers with the specifications. The company says that 'a well-designed case will securely house an Apple device while not interfering with the device\u2019s operation. 'Significant factors in mechanical design include access to the device\u2019s sensors, controls, and connectors. 'A case that encroaches too closely on the perimeter of any camera lens may produce image degradation, even without obstructing the lens. The case should not cause contrast decrease, color shift, image blocking, or flash interference through any camera lens.' Taller yet thinner: The iPhone 5 has gained an increased screen size and a new dock connector . To show the care Apple puts into ensuring a premium experience, it even offers a template against which manufacturers can take pictures to ensure image degradation does not take place. The avid buyers who have pre-ordered their iPhone have used UPS's order page as well as Apple's serial code checker to tease out new facts about their phones. For instance, the earliest manufacturing date discovered so far is August 5th-11th - showing just how tightly Apple runs its ship. An estimated 50million iPhone 5s are likely to be sold over the next year, meaning all of Apple's factories are outputting at maximum capacity to supply demand. Meanwhile, for those who want their hands on the first model, be warned that queues have already started forming outside Apple Shops in London and New York in preparation for the official launch this Friday.",

        "article": "Michelle Obama arrived in China on Thursday for a weeklong visit that will steer clear of politics and instead focusing on education and community. The First Lady arrived in Beijing today, accompanied by . daughters Sasha and Malia as well as her mother Marian Robinson. On Friday, she is to spend the day with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping, something which diplomats hope will build bridges between the two countries. Scroll down for video . Touchdown:  Michelle Obama lands in Beijing with her daughters Sasha, centre, and Malia, right, for a week-long tour of China . Force of one: Although Mrs Obama will avoid politics and instead focus her trip on education, she is set to meet  the wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping tomorrow . 'I think this is a very good . opportunity to improve the China-U.S. relations, as the first lady can . represent the soft side of diplomacy,' said Wang Dong, a political . scientist at Peking University's School of International Studies. 'Michelle . Obama herself has been accomplished in areas such as women's rights, . children issues and education, and I think members of the Chinese public . are anticipating her visit with a positive attitude,' Wang said. During her trip to China, Mrs Obama will visit several schools and universities in Beijing as well as hosting . a roundtable on education and promoting exchange programmes. By her side will be her two daughters, but also her 76-year-old mother Marian Robinson. Mrs . Robinson, the first live-in grandmother in the White House since the . 1950s, is the only living grandparent of Malia, 15, and Sasha 12. United: Michelle has taken both her teenage daughters as well as her mother Marian Robinson on the trip . Well dressed: Ahead of the trip, Mrs Obama's fashion sense has been compared with that of the Chinese First Lady, and she did not disappoint when she disembarked in Beijing . The girls were both in skater-style skirts, black tights and Sasha wore trendy black-laced shoes . The First Lady is no slouch in the footwear department and wore thigh high black heeled boots . True elegance:  Michelle Obama and her daughters are met by Max Baucus,  the new U.S. Ambassador to China, as they arrive at Beijing Capital International Airport . Home team: Mrs Obama is greeted by Baucus, center, and his wife Melodee Hanes, left, after disembarking . She . is a constant presence in Malia and Sasha\u2019s daily lives, helping them . with homework, taking them to and from school and caring for them when . their parents are out of town. White . House officials hope that by accompanying her daughter and . granddaughters, she will \u2018resonate with the Chinese people,\u2019 as it is common . for grandparents help bring up children in the Asian powerhouse nation. In China, and a majority . of South-East Asian countries, families keep multi-generational . households and grandparents are seen as secondary care providers. \u2018I . think they understand the significance as well of family and of three . generations of family traveling together, which I think the Chinese will . appreciate, and will appreciate the ties and the bonds that the Obama . family have with one another across generations,\u2019 the first lady's chief . of staff Tina Tchen said. \u2018This . is a great opportunity for the Obama family to experience that, and I . think for the Chinese to see that as well in an American family.\u2019 The president himself, meanwhile, appears to be suffering from empty-nest syndrome as he addressed an audience at the White House. \u2018Michelle and the girls are on their way to China, it's very lonely at home,\u2019 President Obama said, according to NBC News. Close knit: Mrs Robinson moved in to the White House to help the Obamas care for Sasha and Malia, something which White House officials hope will resonate with the Chinese people . Two sides: U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, . pictured in February, will meet with her Chinese counterpart Peng Liyuan . in Beijing tomorrow . Born: January 17, 1964 (age 50) Education: Bachelor of Arts in sociology (maj) and African American studies, Princeton University and Juris Doctor, Harvard Law . Children: Daughters Malia, born 1998, and Natasha 'Sasha' Obama, born in 2001 . Job before becoming 'First Lady': Vice President for Community and External Affairs at University of Chicago Hospitals. Philanthropic work: 'Let's Move!' campaign to battle childhood obesity, LGBT rights advocate, promotes organic food and healthy eating . Born: November 20, 1962 (age 51) Education: Masters in 'traditional ethnic music' from China Conservatory of Music . Children: Daughter Xi Mingze, born in 1992 . Job before becoming 'First Lady': . After leaving China's People's Liberation Army, she remains a famous . patriotic singer and Dean of the People's Liberation Army Art Academy. Peng is a civilian member of the Chinese army and holds major general . rank. Philanthropic work: Peng has served as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS since 2011 . Xi Jinping (centre) and Peng Liyuan arrive in Kuala Lumpur in October last year. Peng's presence is unusual insomuch as wives of Chinese leaders are rarely seen . Speaking ahead of a screening of Cesar . Chavez, a film about the life of the farm labor activist, President . Obama showed that even the most powerful man in the world can get . confused by technology. \u2018I . cannot stay for the screening; somebody's going to get me the CD. Or . whatever, I'm a little technologically challenged - the DVD!\u2019 Mrs Obama's trip provides an opportunity for the U.S. President and Chinese . President Xi to cultivate a personal relationship through their . wives following their meeting in Sunnylands in California last year, . Wang said. 'Such a personal . relationship with mutual trust is crucial, as the China-U.S. relationship has entered a more challenging phrase,' Wang added. Peng, . Xi's wife, accompanied her husband on the Sunnylands visit but did not . meet Mrs. Obama, who stayed in Washington. Her absence left some Chinese . grumbling and the visit allows the first lady to make up for it. 'I think this provides a natural reason to stay engaged' before Xi and Obama meet again, Wang said. Forever Alone: President Barack Obama, pictured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Thursday, said it was lonely in the White House without his wife and daughters . The trip also gives Peng unusual prominence in a Chinese official culture that usually keeps leaders' spouses in the background. Peng, a popular folk singer, was better known than Xi before he became Communist Party leader and president. 'She has a good presence on television,' said Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. THURSDAY: Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama and Marian Robinson arrive in Beijing. FRIDAY: Joins . China's first lady Peng Liyuan at Beijing Normal School; visits . Forbidden City; meets with Peng and joins her for dinner and . performance. SATURDAY: Addresses . students at Stanford Center at Peking University; participates in . virtual discussion with American youth; visits Summer Palace; meets with . staff and families of U.S. Embassy. SUNDAY: Hosts roundtable on education; visits Great Wall. MONDAY, March 24: Arrives Xi'an, visits Terra Cotta Warriors Museum, Xi'an City Wall. TUESDAY, March 25: Visits Chengdu No. 7 High School; meets with staff and families of U.S. Consulate. WEDNESDAY, March 25: Visits Chengdu Panda Base; has lunch at a Tibetan restaurant. 'This is a formidable soft power China can use for the world to see China is not a monolithic society.' Earlier today it emerged that Michelle . Obama will not take questions from reporters or give interviews during . her tour of China, and members of the press corps who . usually follows the first family everywhere can't travel with her . entourage. And although she . will make a few speeches with reporters in the room, the picture is . largely one of an expensive, taxpayer-funded tourism exercise for Mrs. Obama, her two daughters, and her mother \u2013 not the official trip the . White House has projected. White . House press officials haven't comment on the record about whether a . reported ban on question-and-answer interviews applies equally to . American journalists and international reporters. Limited information made available to MailOnline suggests that only two . out of 22 scheduled events on the trip will afford journalists a chance . to do any significant reporting. The White House also indicated that the two . events during the trip that are completely open to journalists will not see the first lady be interviewed or . take questions, and they are marked 'space . limited' on her itinerary. 'Throughout . the week she will participate in open press and pooled events including . speeches at two schools, questions from students online and forums . including a CNN iReport,' a White House official told MailOnline .",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- The British government has rejected requests to hold a public inquiry into the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, a spokesman for the coroner's inquest said Friday. Litvinenko's widow has been pressing for a public inquiry in addition to a basic inquest -- a coroner-led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in England, where Litvinenko died after being poisoned. UK officials will apprise Coroner Sir Robert Owen in writing early next week of why the public inquiry was rejected, according to a transcript of a hearing held Friday in the matter. A public inquiry, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors. In Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security, and his widow, Marina Litvinenko, had argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. In a deathbed statement, Alexander Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his poisoning, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. Putin foe, exiled Russian oligarch found dead in UK home . Marina Litvinenko told CNN on Friday that \"everybody is down, because we didn't expect this.\" She said that with the coroner's backing, she pressed for the public inquiry \"when we realized that the coroner isn't able to prove the Russian state's involvement in what happened.\" She called for a judicial review of the government's decision. \"I believe that we will find the truth, because I believe that British law can work,\" she said. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital on November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. CNN's Michael Martinez, Jason Hanna and Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.",

Scores of firefighters from two counties converged on the Yorkshire Moors to battle widespread fires that blazed through the night. More than 40 firefighters from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service joined West Yorkshire crews to help tackle pockets of fire that stretched from Mytholmroyd, in Yorkshire, into Littleborough, in Rochdale. At least 14 fire engines were called to the scene, where one blaze at its height stretched for more than a mile, threatening isolated cottages and farmhouses. All night operation: The dry ground was still smouldering today after firefighters spent the night battling flames on the Yorkshire Moors . Damping down: Crews maintained a presence on the moors all night to ensure the safety of remote properties, before once again starting to tackle the flames at first light . The fires had spread across dry vegetation from West Yorkshire and across the county border. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said six fire engines and an operational support unit were called to land behind the Summit pub on Todmorden Road at around 7.30pm last night. Another fire engine from Rochdale and one from Littleborough joined six Yorkshire fire engines in tackling pockets of fire dotted across the moorland. After battling for hours to keep the raging flames under control, crews were forced to withdraw from the hillside for safety reasons as darkness fell. Firefighters maintained a presence on the moorland throughout the night, damping down remote properties under threat from the pockets of fire. They used strategically placed fire engines to protect the properties, crews said. Flames and smoke: A ranger uses a power hose to try to stop the fire flames from spreading further on the smouldering Yorkshire Moors . Quelling the flames: The strong wind and dry ground has allowed pockets of fire to spread across the moorland . Heat: Crews from Manchester and Pontefract attended to support local firefighters as they battled the flames sweeping the landscape near Baitings Reservoir . Moorland fires: Firefighters battled throughout the night to bring the flames under control . Joint effort: Fire crews from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service teamed up with West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service to help tackle the pockets of fire . Station manager Pete Buckley said this morning: 'Overnight we maintained a presence protecting some remote property with a spray of water and we were able to monitor any fire spread and wind changes.'The fire had spread across the dry vegetation from West Yorkshire and we had eight fire engines and an Operational Support Unit tackling the fires at its height.'First light will give us the optimum time and temperature to begin offensively fighting pockets of fire again and continue to defend and protect remote property from any fire spread.' Keeping vigil: GMFRS station manager Pete Buckley said crews had maintained a presence overnight protecting some remote properties using sprays of water . Under threat: Firefighters used strategically placed fire engines to damp down remote cottages and farmhouses under threat from the flames . Dramatic scenes: Two firefighters survey the scene as moorland fires rage overnight . West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews used beaters, back packs, ultra lightweight pumps and water shuttles to tackle the moorland fire. Crews from Mytholmroyd, Todmorden, Halifax, Huddersfield, Mirfield and Skelmathorpe attended the incident, along with specially trained wildfire officers. The cause of the fires has not yet been established, both Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire fire services said today. Pockets: Flames also broke out near Baitings Reservoir, near the M62 motorway, yesterday evening . Specialist wildfire crews: At least 14 fire engines attended the pockets of moorland fire overnight . Remote: Crews began 'offensively fighting' the flames again at first light this morning, Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said .

        "article": "By . Leslie Larson . PUBLISHED: . 16:23 EST, 29 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:42 EST, 29 August 2012 . A South Florida high school could be getting a new quarterback \u2013 with a long, blonde ponytail. High school senior Erin Dimeglio in on track to be one of the first female quarterbacks to take the field in Florida, after strutting her stuff in a preseason game last week. The 17-year-old is a backup quarterback for the South Plantation High School Paladins, in Sunrise, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. Scroll down for video. You go girl: Erin Dimeglio was recruited for the flag football team, when her natural talent was spotted and she began to train with the school's varsity football team in May . The Florida teen has been practicing with the team since May and was able to hold her own during the fourth quarter of the Paladins game on August 24, calling plays and completing two passes, a sign that more field time could be in the cards during the upcoming season. Unfortunately, the game had to be called off early, with 2:43 remaining, due to heavy lightening in the area and the Paladins lost to Seminole Ridge High School, 35-20. 'I couldn't take the smile off my face,' she told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel about her field play last week. 'The other players have been great. After the game, they shook my hand and said it was great I was playing football.' A basketball star in her own right, Dimeglio was actually recruited to play flag football but as she trained, her natural talent for the sport became evident. Paladins football coach, Douglas Gatewood, observed her moves and invited her to train with the varsity team - and a star was born. No special treatment: Dimeglio's coach and fellow team members praise her talent and sportsmanship, insisting that she has to hold her own . Football in Florida is like a religion. The Sunshine State has been a breeding ground for NFL greats like Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and current up-and-comer Jets QB Tim Tebow. The state is joined by Texas and California in producing the most NFL players. Though high school football has seen female participation in the past, most have been in spots like kickers, receivers, defensive backs and offensive linemen (or linewomen). Rarely has a woman ascended to the high profile position of quarterback on the team. Logistically speaking, Dimeglio joins the team in pretty much everything - except the locker room. She changes into her uniform in the empty girls locker room, on the other side of her school. Off the field: Erin Dimeglio (left) says her older sister Amy (right) thinks she is crazy for playing with the boys . 'She doesn't ask for any special treatment,' Coach Gatewood said about his no-nonsense approach to incorporating Dimeglio. 'She's not trying to show anybody up, she really just trying to do her thing and if a boy takes it the wrong way, that's on him, not on her.' 'She's got to walk in the middle of [the football huddle] and tell them what to do and when to do it and they better listen to her ... and they do,' the coach added. State records show a total of 523 female Floridians have taken to the field in high school football since 1973. In 2011, a total of 36 girls played for teams across the state. 'We've had girls in South Florida that had the ability to [play quarterback], but they never have,' Larry Blustein, a Florida high school football analyst, told the Sun-Sentinel. 'You have to give her credit. I've never seen anything like this before,' he said. Leader: As QB, Erin has had to earn the respect of her teammates 'they better listen to her ... and they do,' her coach said . Erin said her older sister, Amy, thinks she is crazy, but 'I just think this is so much fun,' she said. 'I've played flag football since the fourth grade. Scoring on boys is really fun, just to see their reactions, see the coaches get mad. I'll be nervous, yeah. But this is like any other game. You just have to get in the zone and play.' Despite Erin's enthusiasm, her parents are carefully monitoring their daughter in the contact sport known for harrowing injuries. As a veteran athlete, the high schooler has had her fair share of injuries from her tenure on the basketball team, including a broken nose, a broken finger and multiple concussions. 'I've often joked that I wanted her to play basketball with a helmet on,' Kathleen DiMeglio, Erin's mother, said. 'She's no weakling and I think I have confidence after seeing her strength. But of course my greatest fear is injury,' the concerned mom added. And her mom isn't the only one concerned for her safety. Paladin lineman Kevin Avila said that having a girl on the team makes the defensive line feel like they need to step it up. From the court to the field: The 17-year-old high school senior got her start on the basketball team . 'I see her like a sister and you wouldn't want nobody to hurt your sister,' Avila said. 'Since she's a girl, you don't want her to get hurt,' Avila said. 'We want to have more protection for her.' Coach Gatewood has assured her parents that she'll have minimal field time, and would only be brought in to play when the game is going favorably for the team, to avoid unnecessary roughness. With all the fanfare surrounding her athletic pursuits, the teenager insists that it isn't all about sports to her. \u2018As important as playing basketball is in my life, school and my education are a priority,\u2019 she wrote in her profile on a local sport's recruiting website. Adding that her motto is \u2018work and train hard, both on the court and in the classroom. It is as important to take care of your body as it is your mind.' Despite her tough-guy approach on the field, Erin isn't afraid to show her girly side. After her momentous field time last week, her coach encouraged her to take off her helmet to greet the crowd as she exited the field . 'Coach, my hair's all messed up,' she said in protest. 'Don't worry,' he said 'You just played football. Get used to it.'",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Three Mexican migrants were found squeezed together inside a wooden box in the back of a camper van when it was stopped by Border Patrol at a checkpoint near the California-Mexico border. Agents discovered the illegal immigrants after a Border Patrol sniffer dog raised the alarm when the vehicle was stopped near Indio, in the Coachella Valley. The trio were stuffed tight in a storage compartment beneath a bed in the camper van. A wooden lid had been tightly screwed into place above them. Stuffed tight: Mexicans crouch in a box after being discovered in a storage compartment under the bed of a recreational vehicle near San Diego as they tried to make their way illegally into the U.S. When agents unscrewed the lid they found three males, aged 17, 19, and 21, folded over inside the box. The vehicle's 23-year-old male driver and an 18-year-old female passenger, both U.S. citizens, were arrested on suspicion of migrant smuggling. The discovery came as a Mexican woman who received widespread attention for taking refuge in a Chicago church before she was deported in 2007 was released from U.S. custody. Elvira Arellano, 38, was paroled with her 5-month-old son, Emiliano, two days after they openly crossed the border in a challenge to the Obama administrations record numbers of deportations. They are among about 150 people who have sought to enter the country without legal documents at San Diego's Otay Mesa port of entry since last week in protest at U.S. immigration policies. Many planned to claim asylum. The vehicle's 23-year-old male driver and an 18-year-old female passenger, both U.S. citizens, were arrested . 'We are pleased to be here with friends who have helped us,' said Ms Arellano. 'We are going to continue fighting for other fathers and mothers to also be freed.' People who claim fear of persecution are often released from custody while they wait for a judge to decide their cases. It was unclear how many protesters who crossed in San Diego were in custody and how many were paroled. Immigrant rights activist Elvira Arellano waits in Tijuana, Mexico, to enter into the U.S. where she planned to ask for asylum. She is famous for spending a year in a church basement as she fought deportation in 2007 . Unlike similar protests last year in Arizona and Texas, many were not 'dreamers' \u2014 young adults who came to the U.S. as children and were raised here but who were subsequently thrown out by immigration rulings. Some, like Ms Arellano, were parents of young children, while others were indeed 'dreamers', Democracy Now reported. Ms Arellano said she would return to Chicago, where she has an immigration hearing next month. She reunited yesterday with her 15-year-old son who was born in the U.S. and joined her crossing the border two days earlier. For years, Ms Arellano has been an outspoken critic of U.S. immigration laws and and President Barack Obama for the roughly 2million deportations that have occurred during his administration. During marches last week in Tijuana, she rallied the crowd with a bullhorn. Brave: Ms Arellano leads the way through the metal turnstyle during the protest against U.S. immigration policies in which she was joined by around 150 others who were seeking asylum in the country . Ms Arellano hired a smuggler to come to the U.S. illegally in the Nineties and, after three years in Yakima, Washington, moved to Chicago, where she cleaned airplanes for a contractor at O'Hare International Airport. She was arrested in an immigration sting in 2002 but rather than surrender to immigration authorities, she took refuge at the Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago in August 2006. She left after more than a year for a publicity tour that that took her to Los Angeles, where authorities arrested her near a church and swiftly deported her to Tijuana. The latest discovery comes only a day after police in Texas found a stash house crammed full with more than 100 suspected illegal immigrants.The boarded up house in Houston was so full that the occupants were sitting on top of each other and were surrounded by trash bags filled with old clothing.It is thought many of the 108 men and women found inside the 1,500sq ft home had been brought there under a human smuggling operation.",

        "article": "Caroline Foxley, pictured outside Gloucester Crown Court today, denied the money in the Swiss bank account was hers . A mother of two accused of claiming more than \u00a320,000 in benefits when she had \u00a3300,000 deposited in a Swiss bank account has told a jury today that the overseas money was for her children, not herself. Caroline Foxley, 59, said the \u00a3306,000 she put into the Swiss bank was the proceeds of sale of a Cotswold house that her German ex-partner Dr Kurt Mayer had paid for. Although the account was in her name she regarded the money as 'in trust' for Dr Mayer and their children Freddie and Miranda and not hers to use, she told Gloucester Crown Court. The prosecution has alleged that she was a 'greedy and dishonest' woman who milked the State just for 'pocket money' to top up a luxury lifestyle which included putting her children through fee-paying schools including Cheltenham Ladies College. Prosecutor Stephen Mooney claimed at the start of the trial that Ms Foxley made a 'calm, calculated and rational' decision to abuse the benefits system. She claimed income support, Jobseekers allowance and council tax and housing benefit despite having the \u00a3306,000 in the Swiss bank Habibsons after the sale of the house at  Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. But Ms Foxley said she did not use the money except for paying the children's school fees or any other expense on their behalf which Dr Mayer authorised. She herself was without a home after the house sale and was heavily in debt, ultimately being declared bankrupt in 2012, she told the jury. Giving evidence on the second day of her trial she said she always considered the Habibson's account to be Dr Mayer's because the money resulted from the sale of the house he had bought. He had been an Italian based businessman who was often away from home but she regarded him as the 'love of my life,' even after their relationship ended, she said. She told the jury he died in May last year from bowel and colon cancer but she still regarded the Swiss bank money as for the benefit of her children - 24 year old Freddie, who now lives in Moscow, and Miranda, now a geography student at Newcastle University. When she first applied for benefits in 2006 - 2007 it was because Dr Mayer had stopped financially supporting her and the children, she said. He later became embroiled in a court case in Berlin where he was accused of fraud, she added. At that time, because she was worried they might lose the house, she went to Berlin and got Dr Mayer to agree to transfer the house into her name. But she insisted that after the sale of the property she had always received authorisation to pay money out of the account. Defence lawyer David Leathley asked why if she was in such difficult financial circumstances she did not pull the children out of private education to save money. But she said she wanted them to continue with their education uninterrupted. She told how after the relationship with Dr Mayer ended she began a relationship with a GCHQ spybase worker, Paul Watson, who moved into the house with her. They took out a joint mortgage on the property to pay for repairs and an extension but when Dr Mayer found out about Mr Watson he was 'beside himself with anger,' she said. 'He called me a whore and sentiments along those lines,' she said. 'He said the house was for the children, how could I have done such a thing, how could I have another relationship. He had every right to be angry and I was devastated.' Her relationship with Mr Watson ended a few weeks later and the house was sold and the \u00a3200,000 mortgage paid off - leaving her with the \u00a3306,000 equity, she said. She paid the money into an Indian bank and then started using the money which included paying fees to Cheltenham Ladies' College (pictured), the court heard . The cheque for that was given to her in 2007 and she put it into the Habibson's Bank, later transferring 200,000 euros to the Zurich branch. 'Whose money was that?' asked Mr Leathley. 'Kurt Mayer's, it was not mine,' she replied. She said that Dr Mayer later came back into her life and he ran up debts of \u00a3140,000 on her Lloyds TSB bank account after she made him a joint signatory to it. That was one of the debts she was left with when he died, she said. She told the jury that she also had a \u00a360,000 school fees debt, she owed a friend \u00a330,000, another friend \u00a310,000 and had rent arrears of \u00a39,000. She was registered bankrupt in 2012. Mr Leathley asked why she had not solved all the financial problems by using the Swiss account money. She said: 'Because it was never my money.' However, the prosecution say that as the money was in her name it disqualified her from receiving benefits because no-one with assets of more than \u00a316,000 is entitled to claim. Ms Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, but now living in Teignmouth, Devon, denies four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 11:10 AM on 29th November 2011 . A young mother who was left paralysed after a row over a spilt drink broke down in court yesterday after her attacker was allowed home for Christmas. Claire Hilton, 29, yelled at Christopher Towers: \u2018Look what you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve ruined my life.\u2019 She wept as Towers was granted bail, meaning he can spend the festive season at home with his family. He will almost certainly be jailed when he returns in the New Year to be sentenced. Outraged: Claire Hilton outside Newcastle Quayside Crown Court today. She was left paralysed after a pub row over a spilt drink . 'You've ruined my life': Miss Hilton told the court it 'was not fair' was able to spend Christmas at home with his family . The court had heard how Towers, 24, . chased Miss Hilton and then punched her in the face after an argument . over a pint of cider costing \u00a32.80. The impact threw Miss Hilton back on to a dry stone wall and she broke her back and neck. Yesterday . Miss Hilton, who was sat just a few feet away from Towers in her . wheelchair, was unable to contain her anger as he was given bail and . interrupted: \u2018So he gets Christmas out and has ruined my life? It\u2019s not . fair.\u2019 She then waited for . him to leave the dock with his co-accused before looking him in the face . and demanding: \u2018Look at what you have done to me. Look at what you have . done. You have ruined my life.\u2019 Thug: Christopher Towers admitted grievous bodily harm but was bailed until the New Year . Towers, . whose mother and girlfriend were in the dock alongside him, refused to . look at his tearful victim after admitting a lesser charge of grievous . bodily harm and instead strode past her and out of\u00a0 the court. He . had originally been accused of GBH with intent \u2013 a crime that carries a . maximum sentence of life \u2013 but after an eleventh-hour plea-bargain the . charge was dropped for the lesser offence which carries a five-year . limit. He will return to Newcastle Crown Court on January 6 when he will be sentenced. Outside . court Miss Hilton, who is paralysed from the waist down, said: \u2018I . cannot see why he should have Christmas out with his family. He\u2019s ruined . my life forever. I can\u2019t understand why he was bailed. \u2018I . feel totally let down by the justice system. I have been given the . short straw of this throughout. I\u2019m absolutely devastated. My Christmas . is over this year \u2013 all because of him.\u2019 Miss . Hilton, a former telesales worker, was enjoying a quiet night out at . her local pub in June when her cousin, Lauren Mould, 18, accidentally . knocked over the \u00a32.80 drink with her handbag. She . and Miss Mould apologised to Towers, his girlfriend, Kelly McCone, and . his mother, Lynn Faherty, and even offered to buy them a drink by way of . a goodwill gesture, but they refused to calm down. Towers, . his mother and girlfriend, who had spent the day drinking, were asked . to leave the pub and escorted out. But they waited outside the . Wheatsheaf pub in West Boldon, South Tyneside, for Miss Hilton and her . cousin to leave. They then . followed the pair as they made their way home with two friends before . launching the mindless attack. 'Party girl': Claire Hilton, pictured right, with friend Joanna Teasdale, suffered a broken neck and back . Attack: Claire Hilton was attacked close to the Wheatsheaf Pub in an argument about a \u00a32.80 pint of cider . Miss Hilton, who has been told she will . never walk again after the attack, recalled yesterday: \u2018When we got so . far away they seemed to be behind us somehow. \u2018Christopher . Towers seemed to take a run up and punched me full in the face. I was . thrown against this wall with such force that it broke my neck. \u2018A . friend tried to protect me and he got punched. I was knocked . unconscious for a few seconds. As I was lying on the ground he hit me . again. He was like a man possessed. Towers's mother Lynn Flaherty arriving at Newcastle Crown Court . \u2018I . just remember telling my friend \u201cI\u2019m paralysed, I\u2019m paralysed\u201d. I told . him to call an ambulance and said \u201cI can\u2019t feel my legs\u201d. I knew . straight away.\u2019 She added: . \u2018It was all over a spilt drink. It wasn\u2019t even half a glass. We offered . to buy Kelly McCone a fresh drink but they refused. They had been out . all day and were picking fights with other people. We were the . unfortunate ones.\u2019 Miss . Hilton, who spent a month in intensive care, said the assault had . destroyed her family life. She has been unable to live with her son . Callum, 11, and he is being cared for by her mother. \u2018He (Towers) is going to get at the most five years, if that. He has ruined my life and Callum\u2019s life forever,\u2019 she said. She now relies on the support of her parents, Paddy and Jan, and sisters Sam, 24, and Amanda, 33. Towers, . from Boldon, South Tyneside, also admitted assaulting Miss Hilton\u2019s . friend, Hugh Anderson, 47, who was attacked as he tried to protect her. McKone, 30, of Jarrow, admitted common assault on Miss Hilton. Flaherty, 46, of Boldon, admitted assaulting another woman. Judge Esmond Faulks adjourned the case for pre-sentence reports.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- In his first New Year's address, the young North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the nation to embark on \"an all-out struggle\" to overhaul its destitute economy, while striking a conciliatory tone on relations with the South. Broadcast on state media, the speech Tuesday was a break from the approach of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who died more than a year ago and never made televised addresses during his 17 years in power. Although Kim Jong Un has cultivated a much less austere public image than his father, he has still maintained the strong emphasis on advancing the reclusive state's military capabilities, and putting a renewed strain on ties with the United States and South Korea. In his speech, Kim celebrated North Korea's controversial launch last month of a long-range rocket that put a satellite in orbit. Condemned by the United Nations, the move was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. Koreas in 2013: Watch the generational politics . The launch was \"a great event which inspired all the service personnel and people with confidence in sure victory and courage and clearly showed that Korea does what it is determined to do,\" Kim said, according to a transcript of his speech published by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. He linked the launch of the rocket to his call to revamp the nation's poverty-stricken economy, which relies heavily on trade with its key ally, China. \"Let us bring about a radical turn in the building of an economic giant with the same spirit and mettle as were displayed in conquering space,\" Kim said, stressing the need to improve the standard of living of the country's malnourished population. He didn't however provide details on what kind of measures would be introduced to increase industrial and agricultural output. Turning to the tense relationship with South Korea, Kim said that removing \"confrontation\" between the two sides would be important in bringing about their reunification. He criticized the \"hostile policy\" of \"anti-reunification forces\" in the South. His comments come less than two weeks after the election of a new South Korean president, Park Geun-hye, who has promised to pursue greater engagement with Pyongyang than her predecessor did. But her task has been made more complicated by the North's provocative rocket launch last month. In a speech following her election victory, she said she intended to \"open up a new era for the Korean peninsula with strong security and credible diplomacy.\" 2013: Asia's time? The two countries are technically still at war, since no peace accord was reached after the all-out armed conflict they fought in the 1950s. The leader of North Korea at the time of the Korea War was Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. In making Tuesday's televised New Year's address, the younger Kim appears to have rekindled one of his grandfather's traditions. The last time a North Korean leader made such a speech was in 1994 -- Kim Il Sung's last New Year's address before his death. During Kim Jong Il's rule between 1994 and last year, the spoken address on January 1 was replaced by an editorial published by state-run newspapers. The editorial was mandatory study for all citizens, recollecting the achievements of the past year and laying out the tasks for the year ahead, themes apparent in Kim Jong Un's speech Tuesday.",
        "highlights": "Kim Jong Un wants a \"radical\" change in North Korea's economic development .\nHis New Year's address is the first by a North Korean leader since 1994 .\nHe says \"confrontation\" needs to be removed from relationship with South Korea .",

        "article": "The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the Queen looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed. But while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the Royal Family, in reality, they are a clever spoof created by artist Alison Jackson. Inspired by next week's Mothering Sunday, Jackson has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the Queen. Giving the corgis a bath: Charles and Camilla give the Queen's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom . And according to Jackson, that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with bearskin and crown covers. The next photo shows Charles and Camilla, who, as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next Sunday, bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic Union Flag towel. Amusingly, the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry, with Camilla grimacing as Prince Charles accidentally blows hot air in her face. Next comes the big reveal, with the Queen looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray, a card that reads 'Keep calm and reign on' and three pots of the Body Shop's Vitamin E moisture cream. Anyone for a blowdry? Charles' poor aim leaves Camilla needing to close her eyes . A card fit for a Queen: Prince Charles is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan: 'Keep calm and reign on' Decoration: Charles is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover, complete with a crown . Finally, Her Majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis. Jackson is no stranger to reinventing the Royal Family, having previously worked on 'photos' of all the senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Others to feature in her work include Pippa Middleton, who was the subject of her Christmas pastiche, which depicted Miss Middleton desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the Queen. More risqu\u00e9 depictions of the Royal Family include a photo of the Duchess of Cornwall on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of Camilla, this time smoking a cigarette. Doing the wrapping: A suited Charles and a dressing gowned Camilla wrap up their gifts for the Queen . Breakfast in bed: The Queen, clad in a fetching green nightie, looks delighted as she is given her breakfast . Some for you too: The freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share Her Majesty's meal . One particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of Prince George's 2013 Christening, with one photo showing the Queen looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her. Others show a nude William and Kate in the bath with George and another in which the Duchess of Cambridge carefully changes her son's nappy. The latest set of photos were created as part of a 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign being run  by the Body Shop ahead of Mothering Sunday. Campaign: The photos were taken to promote The Body Shop's 'Treat your Mum like a Queen' campaign .",

        "article": "An outspoken, liberal multimillionaire congressman from Florida believes his 24-year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife 'committed bigamy'. Rep. Alan Grayson, 56, whose pretrial hearing was likened to an episode of the Netflix drama 'House of Cards', is set to make claims in court on Monday that his wife, Lolita, was\u00a0still married  when they wedded in Virginia in 1990. The outspoken liberal gained national attention during the debates over health care reform when he said the Republicans' opposing plan was 'don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.' Alan, a Democrat and highly successful trial lawyer, said his wife's marriage to Robert Carson was not dissolved until 1994 in\u00a0Broward County, Florida. However, she claims she divorced Carson in Guam in 1981, and she also disputes that she was divorced in Broward County. If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita  alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers. An outspoken liberal congressman from Florida believes his 24-year marriage should be annulled because his estranged wife 'committed bigamy' (above 56-year-old Rep. Alan Grayson pictured during a House Democrats' new conference in January) Besides bigamy, the divorce has featured mutual allegations of battery, accusations by Lolita of financial abandonment by the congressman and a trial delay caused by her leaking breast implants. Last year, it was reported that Lolita was approved for public assistance by the state of Florida to help feed her four minor children that she has with Alan, according to WFTV. It was shortly after he was named the 17th richest man in Congress. Lolita has claimed she is not the 'Lolita B. Carson' cited in a dissolution of marriage final judgment that Alan said is proof that she was still married to Carson when they wed. Neither side has found Carson. During a recent pretrial hearing, when attorneys were arguing over who had access to the couple's financial documents, Circuit Judge Bob LeBlanc likened the scenario to the well-known Netflix political drama. He said: 'This is starting to sound like 'House of Cards\".' If the marriage is annulled, Alan would avoid having the court divide personal property or decide whether he owes Lolita alimony - his worth is listed by her at $31 million, according to court papers (above 2005 picture of Alan Grayson with his daughter, center,  Lolita, right, and John Edwards, left) Attorneys at the hearing suggested that politics, in part, may be preventing any effort to reach a quiet, confidential settlement that the judge hinted is the best option for the Graysons, who are the parents of five children. 'When lies are told about you and you're in the media, your detractors are going to use it and use it forever more. You have to neutralize that and the only way to do that is to get the truth out,' said Mark NeJame, one of Alan's attorneys. Alan, whose divorce case is likened to an episode of the TV show 'House of Cards', is set to make claims in court on Monday that his wife, Lolita, was still married when she and the multimillionaire congressman married in Virginia in 1990 (Alan, right, and his estranged wife Lolita, left, pictured in an undated photo) When the judge said that both sides had 'calmed down' from the initial acrimony of last year's divorce filing, NeJame shot back, 'except the Republican Party.' Lolita' attorney, Mark Longell, said the congressman was going to 'drag her through the mud' so that he does not look bad. Longwell, who only got the case within the past month, is her third attorney. He requested a trial delay so he could have more time to prepare, and the judge will consider another delay Monday. The trial will move ahead if the judge decides against it.",

        "article": "By . James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 05:03 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 23 April 2013 . We all like the occasional midnight snack, but Lesley Cusack claims to have midnight feasts of up to 2,500 calories every night \u2013 in her sleep. Mrs Cusack, 55, insists her raids on the fridge are not merely a massive attack of the munchies, but are the result of a rare medical condition. The mother-of-three said she only discovers what she has eaten overnight when she sifts through the leftovers and empty packets strewn around her house in the morning. Lesley Cusack cooks even while she is asleep, but says her raids on the fridge are the result of a rare medical condition . The mother-of-three's nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder . Alarmingly, she even chops up food and tries to cook it on her gas hob while asleep. But her nocturnal bingeing is not confined to food. The retired department store manager says she has also tried to eat paint, Vaseline and washing powder. Because her nightly calorific intake is the recommended daily amount for a man, her weight ballooned to 16 and a half stone. As a result, she eats just fruit and salads during the day and has joined a slimming club to keep her weight under control. Her doctors have not been able to give an explanation, but Mrs Cusack believes she suffers from a syndrome called nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder (NSRED). She said: \u2018I had started to find bits of mess downstairs, but I didn\u2019t realise it was me. It was a while before I worked it out, but when I did, I felt very embarrassed and guilty. Lesley, 55, must eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables during the day because she unconsciously eats junk food in her sleep . The mother-of-three must reserve morning fry-ups for special occasions because she has been known to rustle up a cooked breakfast in her sleep . \u2018There were times when I felt extremely depressed through trying to hide it.\u2019 Mrs Cusack, from Warrington, Cheshire, believes she has been suffering from NSRED for several years. But she has only just told her family and sought medical help. She says she has broken some of her teeth and bruised herself by trying to cook and eat food in the dark while asleep. The illness that strikes at night . She finally decided to seek help after realising she was going outside to raid the freezer in her shed. \u2018I was terrified at the thought of leaving the door open or having an accident outside,\u2019 she said. Using the cooker, kettle and sharp knives means it\u2019s only a matter of time before something more serious happens.\u2019 The divorcee, who lives alone, examines her kitchen every morning to find out what she\u2019s eaten at night \u2013 much of it junk food. She added: \u2018I tend to find opened tins of things or packets and I\u2019ve no idea whether I\u2019ve eaten some of them cold or not. \u2018I\u2019ve found soup in pans, but also in bowls. It all can get rather messy. I\u2019ve put alarms on my doors in the hope it will wake me up. I simply turn it off in my sleep. I\u2019m trying to lose weight but it\u2019s a constant battle. I can follow a diet to the letter but it goes to pot at night. \u2018One weekend, I came down to find the cake slice covered in butter. I\u2019d used it while making cheese sandwiches. \u2018The worst things that I know I\u2019ve eaten are emulsion paint, Vaseline, cough syrup, raw potatoes and soap powder. The night I ate paint was the only time I\u2019ve ever woken up. I can still remember standing in the kitchen touching my mouth and being very confused. \u2018My bedding and night clothes are constantly getting stained and need washing. I\u2019m always finding a trail of food leading downstairs. \u2018The disturbed nights, waking exhausted with stomach cramp, feeling sick and finding food in the bed has become almost normal.\u2019 Dr Paul Reading, President of the British Sleep Society and a consultant neurologist at James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, said such cases were rare but not unknown. Lesley has been keeping a visual diary of her nocturnal habits. In this instance she has eaten an unusual combination of a satsuma, a banana, cherry tomatoes a Kit Kat and a Fudge bar . This photo provides evidence of a midnight meal comprising of beetroot, cottage cheese and pickled onions. Hazard: From this photo you can see that Lesley has attempted to poach eggs, which would require using a cooker in her sleep . \u2018A proportion of adult sleep-walkers will eat and even cook during apparent sleep, often consuming foods they would not normally enjoy,\u2019 he said. \u2018Weight gain and guilt are common consequences.\u2019 Mrs Cusack is now waiting to see a specialist who she hopes will confirm she has NSRED. \u2018Living with something that no one sees but that affects my life so much is sometimes impossible to cope with,\u2019 she said. \u2018There have got to be more people struggling with this condition. I can\u2019t be the only person.\u2019 Holiday hell: Lesley's condition makes staying with friends difficult because she is frightened she will raid their kitchen too .",

        "article": "A Pennsylvania prosecutor says two boys charged with the murder of a 21-year-old woman boasted about wanting to rob and kill someone for several weeks and thought they were 'some kind of gangstas'. Ryan Hardwick, 15, and\u00a0Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16, allegedly orchestrated the 'senseless' killing of Stephanie Waters, of Roaring Spring, last week and have now been charged as adults. Waters went missing on January 8, but police found her body two days later on the backseat of her car near an abandoned house in Woodbury. She was lying alongside her dog. Both had been shot dead. 'Senseless killers': Ryan Hardwick, 15 (left), and Deauntay Dontaz Moye, 16 (right),\u00a0allegedly boasted they wanted to live a 'gangsta lifestyle' before robbing and gunning down a 21-year-old woman last week . 'Gangstas': Hardwick and Moye - seen here from Hardwick's Facebook - have been charged as adults with the killing of Stephanie Waters . Murdered: The pair did not know they were meeting Stephanie Waters (pictured), expecting her boyfriend, however went ahead with their planned killing anyway, prosecutors say . According to The Wellsboro Gazette, Moye and Hardwick believed they were buying marijuana off Waters' boyfriend, however she arrived at the location instead. Moye got into Waters' car and sat in the passenger seat, while Hardwick sat in the back with her dog. They drove a short distance and parked, which is when Moye produced a revolver, police say. He then shot Waters in the neck. Seconds later Moye shot her in the head. One of the teens then killed the dog, but it is unclear which. The pair then allegedly moved Waters' body into the back seat and drove her Mazda around smoking weed. Charged:\u00a0Moye (right) faces charges that include criminal homicide, robbery and aggravated assault, while Hardwick faces charges including conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, robbery, and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault . They parked the car at Moye's house and stayed there the night. The next day, Hardwick dumped the car at the location it was found. He then hid the gun and car keys in his closet, where they recovered by police. 'To think that a 21-year old girl \u2013 with a full life ahead of her \u2013 was senselessly murdered over some weed is just heartbreaking,'\u00a0District Attorney Bill Higgins, Jr. said. 'The next time someone tells you that marijuana is a harmless drug ... \u00a0think of the family of this young lady \u2013 21 year-old Stephanie Waters. 'Now even more young lives will be wasted away behind prison bars. 'Marijuana is a harmless drug? Not to these families.' Murder plans:\u00a0During the the investigation, police determined Hardwick and Moye had discussed robbing someone for marijuana for weeks. Moye had also been talking about shooting someone for several weeks . Higgins said the pair set up the drug deal to fulfill their desire to rob and kill. 'These two men wanted to live the ''gangsta lifestyle'',' he said. 'They talked tough and acted tough, and now, they can be tough from the inside of a prison for as long as I can possibly keep them there.' Moye is charged with homicide, robbery and other offenses. Hardwick is charged with conspiracy to commit homicide and other offenses.",

        "article": "By . Daniel Mills . The parents of murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe have revealed their outrage at news a key police interview will be kept secret to protect the privacy of their son's killer. Bruce and Denise Morcombe claim details from an interview Northern Territory police conducted with Brett Peter Cowan could be the key to ensuring he never secures parole. The interview with Cowan is not in relation to Daniel Morcombe but an attack on a six-year-old boy in 1993, Channel Seven reports. But it will not be revealed after it was ruled that doing so would amount to an 'invasion of Mr Cowan's privacy'. Cowan was in March jailed for life for the 2003 murder of 13-year-old Daniel, who he abused and killed in an abandoned house after abducting the teen from a Sunshine Coast bus stop. Scroll down for video . Daniel Morcombe's killer Brett Peter Cowan had requests for the chocolate cereal Coco Pops in jail turned down but is still looking fit and healthy . How Brett Peter Cowan looked - a frail and gaunt figure - before he was locked away in Wolston Correctional Centre . Daniel Morcombe went missing from a Sunshine Coast bus stop back in 2003 . 'That intimate detail and certainly that vision has never been seen,' Bruce Morcombe told Seven about the secret interview. 'He's not entitled to rights, he should be exposed for the person he is.'Denise Morcombe claimed that the interview could provide key information that could ensure Cowan never leaves prison, adding: 'We don't want another child to be murdered or molested.' It comes after the TV network published the first picture of Cowan behind bars, showing a fitter and healthier looking man inside the maximum security Wolston Correctional Centre. It is the first time Bruce and Denise Morcombe had seen their son's killer since he was led away from Brisbane Supreme Court following his sentencing. When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell. Bruce and Denise Morcombe speak after the first photo of Brett Peter Cowan from behind bars emerges of him looking fit and healthy . When he was imprisoned, he had special food requests such as Coco Pops rejected, but in his cell he has his own TV, radio, toilet and shower. Himself a father, Cowan has three children but they won't be seeing their dad for at least 20 years when the 44-year-old is eligible for parole from his maximum security cell. He will be kept in solitary confinement during his time inside purely for his own protection from prison inmates. In some cases, according to prison staff, Cowan requires high level escorts when he leaves his cell to guard him down the halls during weekly visits to the doctor. He visits a gym, a concrete room with a single sun-drenched window, which is the only time he ever gets to see life life outside. Bruce Morcombe said he knows Cowan would be doing it tough, and quite frankly, didn't care much for his treatment behind bars. In a message to Cowan Mr Morcombe told the father of three neither he nor his wife 'feel sorry for sorry him' 'Suck it up,' he said. The high fences and tough security that keeps high-profile inmates, such as Cowan, locked behind the Wolston Correctional Centre . The first images from inside Cowan's cell - complete with a toilet, shower and bed . The parents of Daniel Morcombe leave Brisbane court after Cowan was found guilty for the murder o Daniel in March last year . Back in March Cowan was found guilty of murder, indecent treatment of a child and interfering with a corpse. The Morcombe family declined to be present for the sentencing, in which Supreme Court Judge Roslyn Atkinson spoke at length about Cowan's crimes. She described his crime as 'entirely abhorrent.' 'You didn't look like a monster, you didn't look like a peadophile, you looked like an ordinary person,' she said. 'You knew if he ran away, you'd be caught. So you killed him. You killed him because you didn't want to get caught. 'Everything you did to that boy is horrific and disgraceful. I've seen no evidence in the months you've been in this court that you ever felt any remorse for what you did. 'You have tragically and pointlessly snuffed out a young life.'",

Appearing on the CBS program \"Face the Nation,\" the front-running Republican presidential hopeful repeated his call for some kind of citizen review board to assess whether illegal immigrants would be eligible to get a residency permit and stay in America. Gingrich, a former House Speaker, said the American people would not tolerate the forced removal of someone who has lived in their community for 25 years, has children and grandchildren, and belongs to a local church. However, Gingrich said he expected about 1 million of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants to qualify under the review board process to remain in the country, adding that they would have to be sponsored by an American family. The rest would have to leave, Gingrich said. \"My guess is that 7 or 8 or 9 million would ultimately go home to get a guest or worker permit and return under the law,\" Gingrich said. His immigration policy has come under attack from some rival candidates who call it a form of amnesty -- a virtual dirty word for the conservative tea party movement.",

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . Nigeria's National Council of State is promising to deliver 'some good news' very soon about more than 200 schoolgirls held captive by Islamic extremists for nearly three months. The council, made up of past presidents, state governors and leaders of parliament, is 'satisfied the security agents know very well where the girls are located,' Governor Godwill Akpabio said. The rescue of the girls was top of the agenda at the meeting yesterday, he said, and 'military authorities also confirmed that efforts were being made and that very soon we will have good news.' Waiting for news: Solome Ishaya, sister of kidnapped school girls Hauwa Ishaya stands outside their family house in Chibok, Nigeria. Some 276 schoolgirls were abducted April 15 from a school in northeast Chibok town . The governor added the question is not whether the girls can be rescued but how to do it without endangering their lives. He said the council, which was addressed by President Goodluck Jonathan and his national security advisers, was left confident that the president and the military are 'on top of the situation.' Tuesday's council commended Nigeria's military and security agents, who have been roundly criticized at home and abroad for their failure to swiftly rescue the girls and to curb an escalating Islamic uprising by Boko Haram that has killed thousands. Some 276 schoolgirls were abducted April 15 from a school in north-east Chibok town. Dozens escaped and 219 still are missing. Last week the Defense Ministry reported the detention of a businessman heading a 'terrorists' intelligence cell' who it said 'participated actively' in the Chibok abductions. Negotiations to free the girls without a fight appear to have stalled, with Boko Haram demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan has rejected those demands. A screengrab taken from a video of Nigerian Islamist extremist group Boko Haram shows girls, wearing the full-length hijab and praying in an undisclosed rural location . Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has threatened in a video to sell the girls into slavery and as child brides if his demands are not met. In the video, some of the girls say they have converted from Christianity to Islam. The extremists are believed to have divided the girls into smaller groups being held at different camps and possibly across borders in Cameroon and Chad, where sightings have been reported. There also have been reports that some of them have been forced to marry their captors. Boko Haram has been kidnapping people for more than a year but received international condemnation for the mass abductions of the Chibok girls, which has led to a worldwide movement called #BringBackOurGirls. Boko Haram - which means 'Western education is sinful' - had attacked many schools and killed hundreds of students, some burned alive in dormitories. This year the extremists have launched a two-pronged strategy of bombings in cities and towns and a scorched-earth policy in villages where they kill residents, set huts and shops aflame and steal livestock and food supplies. Hundreds of thousands of people have been made homeless.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- By pronouncement of the sheriff, there will be no Valentine's Day this Friday. That is, if you live in Georgia, north of Interstate 16 and have to drive to get a gift. Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry has designated northern Georgia a \"NO VALENTINES DAY ZONE\" in a post on the department's Facebook page Wednesday night. Men are \"exempt from having to run out and buy lottery scratchers and Hershey bars from the corner stores until February 18, 2014, due to ice, snow, freezing rain,\" the tongue-in-cheek post said. It's all in fun. But rescheduling the festival of lovers to Tuesday would give the ice storm-battered region time to get roads back to normal and make Valentine's a safer affair. Cutting the monotony . Though it sounds like a pretty practical safety suggestion to motorists, it was more likely something else that drove Sheriff Berry to the decision. \"I think he was just trying to cut the monotony,\" dispatcher John Ogle told CNN. Deputies have been practically snowed in at the office for a marathon 34-hour shift, and the sheriff wanted to give them something to smile at, Ogle said. But not just them. \"I think he was just trying to give our spouses a little laugh,\" he said. Ogle's spouse was unimpressed. \"My wife told me it didn't apply.\" School closure announced with 'Ice Ice Baby' No excuses . Women, who saw the Facebook post, lined up to playfully oppose the sheriff's order. 'No excuses!' was their refrain. \"Not my man cause it is my birthday also,\" commented Glenda Robertson, \"so he is not going to get away with this excuse lol.\" Men, predictably, backed the lawman. \"T H A N K Y O U !\" said Ken Darsey's comment, leaping off the page. \"Can you make sure my wife gets a copy of this memo?\" wrote Mark Martin. Other women warned: You knew the day was coming, and you knew the weather forecast. You should've planned ahead. Ogle, the sheriff's dispatcher, did. \"Mine's covered.

        "article": "It seems love might be in the air for a Scottish backpacker who managed to woo a handsome man she saw on the beach by painting him a poster that went viral. Glasgow artist Sarah Milne was relaxing at the beach in Picton - north of Christchurch on New Zealand's South Island - when she spotted her mystery man 'shirtless, wearing black shorts with stars tattooed on his torso and running with a curly, bouncy and blonde dog'. She decided she had to see him again, and despite not knowing anything about him apart from how he looked, decided to create a poster which she hung next to the beach in the hope he would see it. And on Tuesday, she met the elusive gentleman, now revealed as William Chalmers, after her note went viral on social media. Scroll down for video . Love at first sight? Sarah Milne, a backpacker from Scotland, meets William Chalmers, after her note brought them together . He works at a local burger joint and the pair met for the first time on Tuesday in front of a small audience who had gathered at beach to witness the meeting. They were still on the date when they spoke to Daily Mail Australia later that night. Mr Chalmers said the date was going 'fantastically\u2019. \u2018We had a bottle of sauv blanc and sparkling pinot gris. We had a great night. Now we\u2019re grabbing a box of cheap beers... and we\u2019re going to have a party,' he said. When asked if there will be a second date, Mr Chalmers joked to Daily Mail Australia: 'I'm not too sure. You might have to ask me tomorrow just in case I've made an ass of myself.' He added that his and Milne's story proved the world was not such a bad place. They finally meet: Mr Chalmers met Milne just after 2pm and asked if she wanted to go somewhere quiet and have a drink . 'There's a lot of s**t in the world but there's a lot of love in the world,' he said. At 10pm local time, the couple sounded like they were still having a good time as\u00a0Mr Chalmers passed his phone over to Milne who described the whole experience as 'surreal'. 'I had no idea it would go the way it has gone,' she told Daily Mail Australia. '[The date has] been going alright, we've had a few glasses of wine. 'It was overshadowed by every other person in Picton and... [this] very sweet thing it could have been has become this huge public thing. 'It was very embarrassing. I\u2019m not someone who is used to the spotlight. Thankfully he took me away from [the attention at the meeting point].' Milne also played coy when asked if the couple would be seeing each other again. 'We haven't even finished this one because of everyone\u2019s attention but maybe,' she said. 'We need to get over this one first. We're really struggling to find our own space.' Milne and Mr Chalmers made headlines when a hand-painted note made by the artist started doing rounds on the internet. In her note, entitled 'Is this you?', Milne \u00a0- who studied at Glasgow School of Arts before holidaying in New Zealand - invited Mr Chalmers to meet her on the same beach  on Tuesday. She said she had not been expecting the hype surrounding her handwritten note. Love note: The handmade message Milne used to launch a public appeal to find a  man after a brief encounter on Friday . With a bottle of champagne in his hand for their first meeting, Mr Chalmers walked over to where Milne was sitting and said: 'Hello, I'm William, you know you could have just asked for my number. 'Let's go somewhere and have a drink away from everyone,' he told her, as the crowd watching their date clapped and cheered. Mr Chalmers came forward on Sunday morning to reveal himself as the mystery man. On Monday, he told Daily Mail Australia he planned on heading down to the picturesque spot to ask his brunette admirer on a date for the evening. The New Zealander said he first heard of the poster when his housemate came home at 3am on Saturday night and woke him up. 'He was carrying on and telling me about a poster that two German girls had told him about that described me,' Mr Chalmers said. 'He knew it was me because I'm the only guy in Picton who has star tattoos, Johnny-Bravo hair and a labradoodle.' Mr Chalmers said he and his housemate drove down to the shore in the dark to try and find the note, and even when he saw it for himself, he had a hard time believing it was real. Milne was greeted at the picturesque meeting spot with great fanfare after their story had generated huge publicity . The Glasgow artist was greeted as she stepped off her ferry to a sign that said 'Here's to a happy ending'. The poster in question was tied to a pole down at the shorefront and was posted on\u00a0Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page on Saturday. 'I was sitting on the grass on Friday watching the sea... you were playing with your dog. You ran past me and smiled,' it said. 'Would you like to go for a drink/coffee/walk??? I'm in Wellington just now, my ferry arrives back in Picton on Tuesday 3rd. 'I'm in town for 1 night only... But let's see how things go... On the off-chance you are single, remember who I am and would like to meet for a drink/coffee/walk. Mr Chalmers has revealed himself as the mystery man who captured the heart of the mystery woman . He said he was looking forward to Tuesday and meeting his mystery girl . 'I'll be sitting on the grass, watching the sea from 1-1.30pm onwards on Tuesday... Maybe you'll run past again?!?' On Monday, Mr Chalmers said his mother had called him because she had been told of the sign and thought it was such a coincidence that the man described in the sign had star tattoos as well. 'When I told her that it was me, she started freaking out and telling everyone in the office,' he said. 'She's all for me going down. She told me that she didn't raise me to not show up, so that's what I'm going to do. 'It's a bit overwhelming, I've never had something like this happen before. In high school if you passed a note the teacher would just take it off you.' Mr Chalmers said while he did not know who the woman was, he remembered smiling at a particular woman that day on the beach. 'It's all a bit exciting, it's going to be a big day,' he said. The signs were posted on Beachcomber Fun Cruises Facebook page  and has sparked an online debate . 'Picton is a pretty small town and from the amount of people who have told me they're going to come down and watch what happens it sounds like everyone I know will be there.' Milne may have had some inkling of the stir the note has caused, pleading with the public to not have the sign removed from the premises. 'In the spirit of happy endings, give this sign a chance to be seen by the right eyes,' she penned. 'It may even bring a dozen or so people back on Tuesday, intrigued... who is this girl with the long brown hair and the boy with the star tattoos and the dog and will they meet for a drink? 'I will, on my return to Picton on Tuesday, remove it myself... Whatever the ending may be. Thank you!'",

        "article": "A disturbing video has been released showing the horrifying moment a Melbourne man in his 40's was knocked over by his own delivery van and pinned beneath its wheels. The footage, captured by CCTV from a nearby property in Balwyn, shows the man as he is pushed to the ground, before the van gathers speed and rolls over the top of him, dragging him into the street. The man had been delivering a fridge to the house, and it was in the back of the vehicle when it began to roll towards him. A  man was knocked over by his van, and dragged into the street as the wheels ran over his chest and head . The van comes to a stop just before the front wheels roll over him, and he is shown trapped underneath the weight of the vehicle in the middle of the road. Despite the wheels rolling over man's upper body and head, he remained conscious and able to talk until ambulance officers arrived to rush him to hospital. 'The van began to roll, and he's attempted from the rear end to try and stop that himself, which didn't end too well,' Lindsay Bent from Ambulance Victoria told Channel Seven. The man's colleague jumped into the van in order to turn off the vehicle's engine and prevent it from moving further, before the footage shows a maxi taxi arriving just outside the property. Andrew McArthur, a local resident who had arrived back with his family from a holiday in Hong Kong, immediately try to assist by lifting the van off the man's body, reported The Herald Sun. The footage, captured by CCTV from a nearby property in Balwyn, shows the man pushed to the ground . The man, who is in his 40's, is shown trapped underneath the weight of the vehicle in the middle of the road . 'We stopped the car, got the jack out and jacked it up, took the pressure off and waited for the ambulance to arrive,' Mr McArthur said. 'We also chocked the van up with timber, just in case the jack slipped,' he said. Police confirmed that the man's head was pinned under the car, but believed that because of the angle of the road, the man's head was not under the expected amount of pressure. The man was trapped for 25 minutes, surrounded by those who had rushed to help him.

'He was complaining it was getting increasingly more uncomfortable for him,' Mr McArthur told Channel Seven. 'He was saying his back was really sore and the pressure was getting to him.' The man suffered injuries to his pelvis and chest, and despite being taken to Alfred Hospital in a serious condition he is now stable and is expected to make a full recovery. The fridge in the back of the van stayed upright throughout the incident, shocking ambulance officers who said that his injuries could have been 'catastrophic'. 'Put the park break on whatever you do, and stay safe,' said Sergeant Charl Van Tonder.

        "article": "Chancellor George Osborne has failed to reduce welfare spending by as much as planned . The elderly receive \u00a3500 more every year from their State pension than they did four years ago, says a report. But the fact pensions have increased has slashed the savings the Government had pledged to make in public spending. Controversial cuts aimed at reducing the welfare bill have failed to save taxpayers the sums promised by ministers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said. This is partly due to more generous pension benefits introduced at the same time as the cuts. Over the past four years, Chancellor George Osborne has unveiled cuts to tax credits and benefits aimed at saving \u00a319billion a year. But spending on welfare will be just \u00a32.5billion less this year than it was in 2010-11 in real terms. Ministers are likely to come under pressure to make further savings after the IFS suggested the Government had over-estimated the amount its cuts would save. The IFS said the savings gap was partly due to a more generous State pension, seen as an attempt by David Cameron to win the \u2018grey vote\u2019. Meagre pay rises in recent years have also left many workers reliant on housing benefits and working tax credits, pushing up welfare bills. The IFS said that when adjusted for inflation, Britain had saved \u00a32.5billion this year compared with four years ago. The report\u2019s author, economist Andrew Hood, said: \u2018Mr Osborne wants further cuts to social security spending to help reduce the deficit. But he may end up having to make cuts just to stay on track.\u2019 The IFS said that while some benefits such as Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance had been cut, pensioner benefits had risen. The State pension bill has gone up sharply because of a number of changes including the \u2018triple lock\u2019, introduced two years ago. The lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent \u2013 whichever is the highest \u2013 to protect OAPs from paltry increases. But this will cost an additional \u00a345billion over the next 15 years according to estimates. The IFS think-tank also said the UK\u2019s housing benefit bill will be \u00a31billion higher in 2014\u201315 than it was in 2010\u201311, despite promises it would be slashed by \u00a32billion. The rising state pension has contributed to a \u00a35billion increase in spending on OAP welfare, a new study has revealed . This was blamed on poor wage growth and rising rent prices, leaving many reliant on handouts to make ends meet. Poor pay rises also meant the Government had to pay more in working tax credits for employees on low salaries. Cuts of \u00a34.6billion to tax credits were announced, but will drop by \u00a32.7billion compared with 2010-11, the IFS said. The report also blamed \u2018significant\u2019 delays in implementing changes to the disability living allowance (DLA). The Government had predicted cuts of \u00a31.2billion, but the study said DLA spending would actually rise by \u00a31.6billion. Mr Hood said: \u2018The government haven\u2019t implemented all the cuts that they announced. \u2018But more importantly other things like the number of pensioners and low-paid people have pushed up spending in real terms.\u2019 However falling unemployment meant the Jobseekers\u2019 Allowance bill dropped by \u00a31.3billion, much more than the \u00a3100million ministers had pledged to cut.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- White House hopeful Mitt Romney will tell Americans Thursday morning as he seeks to become the nation's first Mormon president that he shares the same \"moral convictions\" as other people of faith. GOP White House hopeful Mitt Romney says his address won't be a \"JFK speech.\" The former Massachusetts governor is delivering the speech to address religion's role in government but also to address concerns voters might have about the Mormon religion. In excerpts released Thursday morning, Romney talks about the shared convictions of all faiths. But he resists those who would have him explain his own faith. \"There are some who would have a presidential candidate describe and explain his church's distinctive doctrines. To do so would enable the very religious test the founders prohibited in the Constitution,\" according to the excerpt. \"No candidate should become the spokesman for his faith. For if he becomes president, he will need the prayers of the people of all faiths.\" The GOP contender has brushed off comparisons between his speech and John F. Kennedy's famous address about his religious beliefs, insisting it won't be a flashback to 1960. \"I'm not going to be giving a JFK speech,\" Romney said. \"He gave the definitive speech on discrimination relating to a political campaign, and what he said makes sense to me. I'm going to be talking about the role of religion and faith in America, in a free society.\" However, he added, \"I certainly will answer some questions related to how my own faith will inform my presidency.\"  Watch why Romney's faith could trouble some voters \u00bb . The GOP candidate's campaign announced on Sunday his plans for the speech on \"Faith in America.\" Romney will give the address at 10:30 a.m. ET at former President George H. W. Bush's presidential library in College Station, Texas. About 300 people -- a combination of friends, family and religious and conservative leaders -- will be in the audience, according to a campaign spokesperson.   Watch what's behind Romney's decision to talk about faith \u00bb . Nearly a half century earlier, Kennedy took the stage in Houston, Texas, and addressed concerns that the Vatican would influence his policies. \"But because I am a Catholic, and no Catholic has ever been elected president, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured -- perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this,\" Kennedy said before Southern Baptist leaders on September 12, 1960.  Watch Kennedy describe the 'real issues' of his time \u00bb . \"It is apparently necessary for me to state once again -- not what kind of church I believe in, for that should be important only to me -- but what kind of America I believe in,\" he said, adding \"I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.\" Kennedy's move was daring. He had come under attack for his Catholic upbringing, and he was tackling the issue before an audience of Southern Baptists. \"Given the closeness of the vote, you could easily make the argument that JFK won because of that speech,\" said CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider. The man who wants to become the first Mormon president faces a different religious climate. Nearly 77 percent of those questioned in an October CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll said the fact that a candidate is a Mormon would not be a factor in the way they vote for president. But a significant portion -- 19 percent -- said they are less likely to vote for a Mormon. \"Those who have the biggest problem supporting a Mormon are church-going and evangelical Christians -- particularly those who believe that Mormonism is not a Christian religion,\" Schneider said, citing the October poll.  What do Mormons believe? \u00bb . And that also represents a large portion of the Republican base. Kennedy wasn't viewed as a prominent player in Catholic circles. He told the Texas crowd, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who happens also to be a Catholic.\"  Watch Kennedy promise to separate his religion's views from his own \u00bb . \"Non-Catholics expected Kennedy to say his faith would make no difference, which is hardly what today's Republican Christian conservatives want to hear,\" religion reporter Dick Ostling said in an interview with ReligionWriter. Romney, however, is active in his church. At age 19, he became a full-time missionary of the Mormon church, temporarily leaving college to fulfill a Mormon calling and eventually becoming the equivalent of a bishop. Romney later made a fortune in the business world, and played a big role in the financial success of the 2002 Olympic winter games. In 2002, he defeated the Democrats and became governor of traditionally liberal Massachusetts. In 1960, Kennedy was already the Democratic Party nominee when he made his famous speech. Romney, on the other hand, has yet to seal his party's nomination. He is still vying for his party's vote, and the evangelical Christian vote in particular, which some say puts him in a more difficult position than Kennedy. \"Romney will address deeply committed religious Republicans and tell them, 'My values are the same as yours, even if we belong to different churches,' '' Schneider said. Brushing off differences between Mormons and other Christians is not the best campaign strategy, according to Ostling in RW. \"Better to candidly admit there are differences but these should not affect voting decisions,\" Ostling told RW. \"The more effective plea is tolerance, asking voters to follow the spirit of the Constitution's ban on any 'religious test' to hold public office.\" The Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims about 12 million adherents worldwide, roughly half of them in the United States. Followers consider themselves Christians, but elements of Mormon theology -- that the Garden of Eden was located in what is now Missouri, that a lost tribe of Israelites settled in North America and that a resurrected Jesus Christ visited them -- differ sharply from orthodox Christian belief. The church's early belief in polygamy fueled its persecution as followers migrated across the United States, but church leaders banned the practice in 1890.  E-mail to a friend .",

        "article": "This meeting is fast turning into a gala performance by the double act of Irish champion trainer Willie Mullins and his British counterpart Paul Nicholls. Having seen Mullins, ably assisted by stable jockeys Ruby Walsh and Paul Townend, smash the home team on Tuesday with four winners headed by his Champion Hurdler Faugheen, it was Nicholls\u2019 turn on Wednesday. He won the feature \u00a3350,000 Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase with Dodging Bullets as well as the Coral Cup with Aux Ptits Soins, both ridden by stable jockey Sam Twiston-Davies, and the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle with Qualando, the mount of Nick Scholfield. Dodging Bullets (front) delivered a second winner of day two for jockey Sam Twiston-Davies . With Mullins also landing the RSA Chase with Bryan Cooper-ridden Don Poli, the two dominant stables in jump racing have now won eight of the 14 Festival races run so far. Nicholls denied he had driven home on Tuesday depressed or frustrated having drawn a blank in the face of the Mullins\u2019 mullering. But the mood for the journey home last night must have been some contrast. Almost amazingly, Dodging Bullets\u2019 one-and-a-quarter length defeat of 33-1 shot Somersby was the first steeplechase Nicholls had won at this meeting since Kauto Star landed the 2009 Gold Cup. Back in third was Irish-trained front-runner Special Tiara but the big two \u2014 2013 winner Sprinter Sacre and last year\u2019s champion Sure De Grugy \u2014 blew out. Trainer Gary Moore and jockey son Jamie felt the ground had dried out too much for fourth-placed Sire De Grugy, who has endured an injury-plagued season while Sprinter Sacre, a spent force by the home turn, was pulled up before the last by his jockey Barry Geraghty. Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets successfully clear a fence on their way to victory . Twiston-Davies laps up the applause as he is led in after winning the Queen Mother Champion Chase . His trainer Nicky Henderson said there was no evidence Sprinter Sacre\u2019s old fibrillating heart problem had affected his gelding and a scope examination showed no signs of a significant blood vessel break. However, the feeling was an old breathing issue might have re-surfaced. There will be no snap decisions but there must be a chance he has run his last race. Henderson said: \u2018It is disappointing for everybody who has worked their socks off to get him back.\u2019 The outcome once again showed how hard it is to come back and the result had echoes of the 2010 Gold Cup won by Imperial Commander when the focus was on the Nicholls-trained pair of Kauto Star and Denman. This time it was the turn of 9-2 shot Dodging Bullets, winner of this season\u2019s Tingle Creek and Clarence House Chases, to be cold-shouldered in the build-up as the spotlight fell on the big two. And there to cheer him home was his breeder, three-time champion Flat jockey Frankie Dettori, looking like he should be part of Elliot Ness\u2019s crew in his brown trilby and mac. He hoped he was breeding a future Derby winner when he sent the mare Nova Cyngi to the stallion Dubawi. He ended up producing the victor of one the season\u2019s biggest jumps races. Dettori said: \u2018I am only a small part in this amazing story but I am so pleased for Paul and the owners. I can say I have bred the best jumps horse of 2015.\u2019 Dodging Bullets returned at 9-2 after landing the Queen Mother Champion Chase . Twiston-Davies celebrates with the Queen Mother Champion Chase trophy . The result was no surprise to Nicholls, who said: \u2018He was the form horse. He beat Sprinter Sacre at Ascot and I couldn\u2019t see how he could turn that around. With all due respect to Gary Moore, I also thought Sire De Grugy had it all to do. He has had a problem. \u2018I can see the sentiment side of it but the progressive horse normally comes out on top. I was fairly confident I had them covered, Champagne Fever was the one I was getting worried about and he was a non-runner.\u2019 Nicholls puts Dodging Bullets\u2019 improvement this year down to greater maturity and solving a gastric ulcer problem, as he has with tomorrow\u2019s Gold Cup favourite Silviniaco Conti. This success can only serve to strengthen both stable and punter confidence in his chance. Nicholls added: \u2018We felt he was losing his way but couldn\u2019t work out why. We found the gastric ulcer, treated for that, and like Silviniaco Conti he is a different animal. He won the best turned out award and it was as well as he has been.\u2019 The results were also further vindication of Nicholls\u2019s decision to hand the pressure job of stable jockey to 22-year-old Twiston-Davies at the start of the season, a move made earlier than expected when others threatened to sign him up. Nicholls heeded advice from former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. \u2018He said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want the best striker in the league playing for another team.\u201d Someone said Sam will last me until I retire. I don\u2019t know if he will last that long but he is a good lad who will be part of the team for a long time.\u2019 A bad day for Henderson was made worse when Rolling Star suffered a fatal injury in the Coral Cup. It was all smiles for the connections of Dodging Bullets . Frankie Dettori (second right) couldn't hide his excitement after Dodging Bullets' victory .",

        "article": "Forget the wrap dress, one company's answer to a stylish ensemble is more like a wrapper dress. These quirky designs - from a playing card cocktail dress to a floor-length gown - are put together using a range of recycled rubbish, by company Garbage Gone Glam. The innovative eco-fashion line is the brainchild of Kristen Alyce, who spends weeks designing and bringing the ideas to life - made with thrown-away drink cartons, leaflets and unwanted concert tickets. Scroll down for video . Kristen Alyce (not pictured) creates dresses out of recycled rubbish. Pictured: Four prom style dresses made from (left to right) Tropicana wrappers, advert posters, newspapers and sweet wrappers . Based in Palm Beach, Florida and New York, the company says that they have thousands of planet-friendly fashionistas queuing up to snap up their designs. Kristen, 28, says that she began dreaming up bin bag ball gowns while she was in college after becoming irritated with the amount of rubbish she produced and wanted to find a creative outlet for it. 'I realised as a college student living with three girls we created so much waste it was incredible. Kristen began creating the dresses in College when she was irritated with the amount of waste she was producing and wanted to find a creative way of using it. Pictured: Floor length dress made from magazines . Kristen started by making one dress but soon found they were so popular she turned her hand to many more. Pictured: A skirt and tube top made from gym membership brochures . Kristen uses a variety of materials from shopping bags to sweet wrappers to create her unique designs. Pictured: (left) A cocktail dress made from Skittle wrappers (right)\u00a0This dress was made using leaflets . Kristen has began creating dresses for several different clients, here she had made a floor length gown for Hyundai using their brochures and seat belts . 'So I started saving the mass amounts of plastic bags, magazines, boxes and packaging we went through on a daily basis.' Although Kristen originally began her recycling project as a bit of fun she soon found her designs to be more popular than anticipated. 'I created the first dress - mainly for fun to test my creativity - out of plastic bags and rolled magazines. Kristen worked for Couture Fashion Week in New York during college. Pictured: A skater dress made from SunFest concert tickets . Kristen is concentrating on expanding her line for men which includes jackets, trousers and board shorts. Pictured: (left) A cocktail dress made from playing cards (right) and a men's tie made from a deck . Kristen says that the dresses will last the whole evening and can be kept for many more uses. Pictured: A dress made from Nick's diner menu cards . 'People loved it so after years of production assisting and watching shows from the side-lines I created 12 dresses.' Kristen worked for Couture Fashion Week in New York during college and saw first-hand the impact fashion had on society. 'People go crazy over styles, colours, new looks, vintage looks, gowns, pretty people and gorgeous designs. Kristen has also created themed dresses such as this festive one for Christmas made from wrapping paper . Kristen says that the vintage design of her dresses appeals to many. Pictured: A bodycon dress made from bandages and plasters . 'As I worked backstage I knew with my background in Fine Art I could find a way to use that same impact to better our planet.' Kristen has seen her business snowball and now has all kinds of customers lusting after her innovative designs. Garbage Gone Glam now has its own online shop with dresses retailing from around $500 (\u00a3330) to $1,500 (\u00a3990). Kristen's aim is to create beautiful designs that are more eco-friendly. Pictured: A cocktail dress made from Suero Viv wrappers and bottles . The dresses may be slightly more expensive than your standard party dress but Kristen says that people aren't put off by the price. 'Now everyone wants a dress - small businesses, larger companies, teenagers, and socialites - all waiting for something they can buy. 'We specialise in cocktail dresses and ball gowns, but we do have a line for men. Ties of all kinds and custom suit jackets, trousers and board shorts. 'The gowns can be worn all night long and kept intact for many uses.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Apps have changed the way we travel. From helping us pack to checking-in, and from coping with jetlag to booking a hotel once we've landed -- these handy tools can be used every step of the way. With relaxing visions of mobile convenience in mind, I thought traveling from London to Rome using only apps would be stress-free and easy, but it didn't quite work out that way. See also: The future of flight is shape-shifting engines . I began my journey by using the private car service, Uber, to take me to Paddington Station where I was to catch the Heathrow Express. Uber is free to download and all you need to do is pre-register your credit card details. It will then tell you how far away the closest car is to you, along with a photo of the driver. So far, so good. All-aboard . Next up was the Heathrow Express app. This turned out to be the easiest facility I used. Again with pre-registered credit card details it only took a couple of minutes to book my ticket. The QR code turned my phone into my ticket which saved me scrambling at the ticket machine on the platform. Feeling quite pleased with the journey so far, my bubble was truly burst when I attempted to check-in with the BA app. This was the first time I used it as I usually check-in online the night before. To continue in the spirit of booking on the move, I tried to check-in whilst on the Heathrow Express, which was unsuccessful due to patchy signal going underground. Once at Heathrow's Terminal 5, the app still didn't work. Every time I tried to check-in, I had to fill out my additional passenger information which took a lot of time tapping in the same information. After eight attempts, I tried the self-check-in kiosk which said I had already checked in! See also: The $1 trillion business travel industry . The problem was it didn't give me an option to print my boarding pass. Great, I thought -- I haven't even made it onto the plane and I've failed. Then, just as my passport was going to be swiped at a check-in desk, the screen on my phone started refreshing and then suddenly -- my boarding pass appeared. The app challenge continues! Rome-ward bound . Coming out of arrivals at Rome FCO, I didn't even have to look at my phone as I recognized Fabio, my Uber driver from the photo provided. No name boards, no phone calls -- I just waved and said \"You must be Fabio?\" I started looking for a hotel to stay once we reached the Spanish Steps in central Rome -- I had downloaded Hotel Tonight, Priceline and Booking.com to help with the task. As I perused with patience, looking at the photos and the room features, I suddenly began to get text messages informing me how much I had spent on data roaming. $5...$10...$30...$50 \"Ahhh it keeps going up and up and I haven't found anything yet!\" I had failed to book a room at not one but two hotels. The rooms had gone after I tried to process my payment and there was no-one to complain to. I successfully booked the third hotel I tried -- and just when I thought it was too good to be true. It was! The hotel had oversold the rooms and they had moved me to their sister hotel up the road which they said was better. Unfortunately it wasn't and in the less desirable area of Termini station. Out and about . By the time I had checked in it was too late to go hunting for food and try out some restaurant apps suggestions via Twitter. I wish there had also been more time to try out some of the city guide apps as well as the Rome MVR app -- which allows you to see monuments like the Coliseum in their former glory. See also: Apps and scanners ease travel expense pain . Augmented Reality apps are still in their infancy so I will definitely be keeping an eye on how these develop and try them out. Overall, my apps experience wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Some were simple to use whilst others were more time-consuming and fiddly. To avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end I had spent $160 -- I would use apps that are quick and easy. That way you'll have more chance of staying travel appy!",

        "article": "(CNN) -- After the craziness of the winter weather, it's time for some positive predictions, right? Meteorologists are on the lookout for a weather pattern that could mean a milder hurricane season for the East Coast this summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday that there's about a 50% chance of a weather phenomenon called El Nino developing this summer or fall. That's not a guarantee, but conditions are favorable enough in the next six months to warrant an \"El Nino Watch.\" An El Nino event occurs about once every three to seven years, said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It involves the warming of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, and results in major changes in the jet stream where storms track. As the ocean builds up heat in the western Pacific Ocean, some of the heat goes into the atmosphere through evaporation. The moistened atmosphere invigorates storms, Trenberth said, changing where hurricanes and typhoons occur. But those of you on the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast, rejoice: \"It means that the Atlantic hurricane season will be rather weak because it can't stand the competition,\" Trenberth said. An El Nino event would likely mean more shear -- wind speeds that increase with height -- in the upper levels of the atmosphere during hurricane season. This wind shear would suppress the development of tropical systems. California would also benefit if El Nino conditions develop and continue into the winter. The state is suffering from one of the worst droughts in its history. An El Nino pattern in the winter time usually results in much wetter conditions for the West Coast. Because El Nino warms up the atmosphere as a whole, we may see a mini global warming phenomenon, Trenberth said. Places that shivered through a deep freeze this year may see above-average temperatures next winter, if the pattern continues, Trenberth said. But in other parts of the world, El Nino can be quite disruptive, depending on where you live. Monsoons in India and droughts in Australia may result, Trenberth said. Hawaii would be more likely to see a hurricane. Flooding in Peru and Ecuador are also associated with El Nino. Farmers there have switched from cotton to rice farming to adapt during such times, Trenberth said. In February, sea surface temperatures were below average in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, but above average near the International Date Line, NOAA said. There were also strong low-level westerly winds reappearing over the central equatorial Pacific, which could help to hold onto the increased heat content in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific. Right now the El Nino Southern Oscillation is in its \"neutral\" phase -- neither warm nor cool -- but models suggest that El Nino could develop. The last record-breaking El Nino event was in 1997 to 1998. The pattern led to a relatively warm winter, but also a series of devastating weather events: Flooding in the Southeast and California, an ice storm in the northeast and tornadoes in Florida. \"Be careful what you wish for sometimes,\" Trenberth said.",

        "article": "By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Read my lips: Obama told the AMA four years ago that 'no matter how we reform health care ... If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' Between half and three-quarters of Americans who buy their own health insurance on the open market will lose those plans in the next year as Obamacare is pushed into full implementation, according to a blockbuster report sure to give the White House a new round of health-care headaches. 'No matter how we reform health care,' a newly minted President Barack Obama told a meeting of the American Medical Association in June 2009, 'we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' But regulations formulated by his own administration make it . clear that the White House never intended to to give Americans that . level of free choice about their medical insurance options. Washington, D.C. buzzed Friday with reports of what NBC News had surfaced: an under-the-radar notice in the Federal Register, which MailOnline has dated to June 17, 2010, laying out the administration's expectation that most people who buy their own health insurance will soon have no options other than paying exorbitant rates or joining the federal government's insurance exchanges. White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told NBC that 'nothing . in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans: The . law allows plans that covered people at the time the law was enacted to . continue to offer that same coverage to the same enrollees.' But millions of individual insurance plans don't comply with Obamacare's minimum standards, which include services like children's vision care, dental coverage and reproductive health options that some consumers don't want. Millions more with policies written before March 2010 will lose the 'grandfather' status President Obama has promised them because of tiny, marginal changes like premium adjustments or revised prescription copay rates. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House spokesmanJay Carney conceded Monday that 'it's true that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual market that don't meet [Obamacare's] minimum standards and therefore do not qualify' to survive . Smoking gun: The IRS published official notice in 2010 that it expected most Americans with individual health insurance plans would lose them under Obamacare . I told you so: A spokesman for long-time Obamacare foe Sen. Ted Cruz emailed the NBC News report all over Washington on Monday as soon as it hit the Internet . 'Any insurance that you currently have would be grandfathered in so you could keep it,' President Obama claimed during a CNN broadcast in February 2010. 'And so you could decide not to get, in the exchange, the better plan. I could keep my Acme insurance, just a high-deductible catastrophic plan. I would not be required to get the better one.' John Kyl, then a Republican senator from Arizona, countered with words that now seem prescient: 'That's for a very limited period of time.' The White House's website continues to communicate the president's earlier promises. 'If you like your plan you can keep it,' one page reads, 'and you don\u2019t have to change a thing due to the health care law.' Under the Affordable Care Act and the tens of thousands of pages of related regulations, the grandfathering Obama promised only applies to insurance policies that continue, unchanged, from year to year. Requirements in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 often force health insurers to rewrite their policies annually in order to re-state consumers' privacy guarantees, now well-known as 'HIPPA' rights. That simple act of re-issuing a policy that's identical to the previous one would also render it ineligible for 'grandfather' status. 'A reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate and therefore relinquish their grandfather status is 40 to 67 percent,' the IRS wrote on July 17, 2010. The White House's website continues to claim: 'If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health care law' That estimate only covers policies that lose their 'grandfathered' status by changing, and those which Americans voluntarily leave for other reasons. But still more will lose coverage, the IRS wrote, because their chosen levels of insurance will suddenly fail to meet the White House's definition of an adequate policy. 16 million: Health care analyst Bob Laszewski predicts that's the number of Americans who will lose their preferred medical insurance plans in the coming months . The annual total likely 'exceeds the 40 percent to 67percent range,' according to the IRS's statement more than three years ago. Overall, NBC reported Monday that of the 14 million U.S. consumers who buy individual health insurance plans, 50 to 75 per cent will likely receive cancellation notices during the next year. And the administration has been expecting that outcome since 2010. That conclusion came as a result of estimates from four sources deeply involved with the administration's work on the Affordable Care Act, one of whom said as many as 80 per cent of individual insurance customers will be short on choices by this time in 2014. Months of wrangling over the Obamacare law in 2009 included jousting over whether a range of services including mental health and drug abuse treatments, dental provisions and and vision care for children should be mandated for every qualifying insurance policy, even though not all consumers want them. Democrats generally won those battles, resulting in a minimum set of health insurance standards that has placed most individual policies out-of-bounds. In their places are new, more robust plans expected to bring 'sticker shock' to millions. Health policy analyst Bob Laszewski, who consults with America's largest insurers, estimated this month that 'as many as 16 million' such policies will be canceled because they don't comply with the Obamacare law. That represents 80 per cent of his estimate that 19 million such plans, provided by neither governments nor employers, are in existence today. Fox News Channel's Megyn Kelly exploded: Obama 'said \"if you like your plan you can keep it, period.\" If he wanted to be honest, he should not have said \"period.\" He should have said \"asterisk.\" News networks buzzed late on Friday as they discovered what NBC had found: evidence that the Obama administration has known for three years that the president's promise simply couldn't be kept. This example, from July 19, 2010, hit the Internet five weeks after the IRS published it in the Federal Register (above) The White House has begun to concede that many Americans who buy their health insurance directly from companies on the open market will lose their current coverage, but counters that most of them will find better coverage on the exchanges, and at a lower net cost when subsidies for lower-income taxpayers are factored in. Cornered by a reporter on Monday, . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney admitted that 'there are going to . be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act to create minimum . standards of coverage, minimum services that every insurance plan has to . provide.' 'So it's true,' he said, 'that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual . market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not . qualify for the Affordable Care Act.' The National Center for Public Policy Research has chronicled recent news reports documenting 1.49 million policy cancellation notices that insurers have already sent customers in New Jersey, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Additional reports in\u00a0 Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, the organization said, came without precise numbers. In California, the Los Angeles Times reports that the recipients of those letters are surprised to learn how much they would have to pay to stay insured without entering a government-run program. 'This is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people,' Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told the Times. 'There are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act.' How long are Americans' memories? Obama's 2009 American Medical Association speech, and the dozens that preceded and followed it, laid down a marker on consumer choice that he won't find it easy to escape . HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (L) will face congressional questions Wednesday about the Obamacare rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner (R) will have her turn Tuesday. On Tuesday a key Obamacare administrator will testify in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about the unrelated technical failures that have plagued Healthcare.gov, the Obamacare system's main website. Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will face tough questions about why the website was launched without adequate testing, and why her agency was tapped to coordinate the work of dozens of software contractors instead of a more experienced outside company. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will have her turn on the hot seat Wednesday, when she faces a hostile panel in a House Commerce and Energy Committee hearing. Sebelius's grilling will likely include broader questions about the Obamacare program. She was asked to appear in Congress last week but declined.",

        "article": "By . Nick Enoch . PUBLISHED: . 07:39 EST, 30 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:13 EST, 30 December 2013 . A former British teacher has been jailed for more than three years for a sex attack on a nine-year-old boy on a Caribbean island. Keen sailor Derek Ide, 67, sexually assaulted the child on board his yacht in Trinidad. Ide, who was held by the boy's father following the incident before he rang police, could be extradited to the UK to serve his sentence here. It happened at a Power Boats boat yard in the coastal town of Chaguaramas, in the St George West area of the country, where Ide has 'strong ties'. Former teacher Derek Ide, 67, from Southampton, has been jailed for more than three years for a sex attack on a nine-year-old boy in Trinidad. The incident occurred on Ide's yacht in the town of Chaguaramas (file picture) Ide pleaded guilty to serious indecency after prosecutors on the tropical island amended the charge from grievous sexual assault. The ex-teacher, from Southampton, Hampshire, has spent at least half a year in Trinidad for the past eight years, Port of Spain Magistrates Court heard. He was arrested after the boy told his parents - who are not native to Trinidad - about the assault. Ide was held by the boy's father, who then contacted police and officers arrested him in April. During his first court appearance shortly after the offence, Ide cupped his hand over his left ear during the proceedings and sported a black eye. Ide initially denied grievous sexual assault but changed his plea to guilty to a lesser charge of serious indecency. Now a magistrate on the tropical island has sentenced him to three years and four months behind bars. Former tutor: Derek Ide used to be a teacher at Bellemoor High School for Boys, now Upper Shirley School in Southampton . Under Trinidad law, Ide could have faced up to ten years behind bars. However Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor sentenced him after telling the court children needed protection from sexual predators. Sean Cazabon, mitigating, said an application will be made to the British High Commission to have him extradited. The teacher - who was convicted of a similar offence in the UK in 1983 - is willing to receive therapy and counselling when he is deported, he said. Neighbours near Ide's home in Southampton spoke of their shock at his arrest. He had taught at the former Bellemoor School in Southampton and was elected president of the Southampton Schools Association in the 1970s. He was also an active member of the residents association at the block of flats where he lived. One resident, who asked not to be named, said 'It's a big shock as whenever I saw him he was very nice and polite. 'I haven't seen him for a couple of years, but he owned a boat here and a boat there and used to go to the Caribbean in the winter. He was really into sailing.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- L'Wren Scott, a notable fashion designer and longtime girlfriend of Mick Jagger, killed herself by \"hanging,\" New York City's chief medical examiner's office announced Wednesday. \"The manner of death was determined to be suicide,\" said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the office. Scott's remains have been claimed, according to Bolcer, though it was not immediately known by whom. Wednesday's announcement makes official what was suspected after news came out about the 49-year-old woman's death. Business woes may have triggered suicide . A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation earlier said Scott's assistant -- after responding to a text to \"come by\" -- found the designer hanging from a door knob with a scarf around her neck on Monday morning. The lanky former model transitioned to become a stylist and eventually a designer. She designed costumes for films such as the 1996 remake of \"Diabolique,\" 2000's \"Mercy\" and 2007's \"Ocean's Thirteen.\" In addition to her haute couture creations, she designed a collection for Banana Republic that was introduced late last year. Madonna, Allison Williams and Christina Hendricks were among her celebrity clients. But she was most closely associated with Jagger, 70 -- not just for designing the iconic rocker's duds for the Rolling Stones' 50th anniversary tour, which began in 2012, but for being his longtime companion. The couple had been dating since at least 2003. \"I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way,\" read a statement on the singer's website, MickJagger.com. \"We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.\" People we lost in 2014 . CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- England winger Theo Walcott scored twice as Arsenal fight back from going two goals behind to sensationally thrash north London rivals Tottenham 5-2, a result that lifts Arsene Wenger's side back into fourth place in the Premier League table. Matches between the top sides in England this season have produced a host of remarkable results -- and it proved no different at The Emirates on Sunday on a glorious sunny afternoon. Third-placed Tottenham began the day 10 points ahead of their neighbors and still with designs of catching Manchester City and Manchester United at the top of the table. And they achieved the perfect start when Louis Saha's shot deflected in off defender Thomas Vermaelen to give Spurs a fourth minute lead. The visitors then doubled their advantage when former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor scored from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was adjudged to have brought down Gareth Bale. But Arsenal rallied and two goals in the last five minutes of the half brought them level. First defender Bacary Sagna nodded home Mikel Arteta's cross, then Premier League top scorer Robin van Persie curled home a superb effort -- his 23rd league goal of the season. Arsenal maintained their momentum after the break and Tomas Rosicky put them ahead in the 51st minute when flicking the ball home from close range. By now Arsenal were rampant, and Walcott made it 4-2 after 65 minutes after Van Persie superbly laid the ball into his path. With Tottenham demoralized, Walcott then added a fifth just three minutes later, outpacing the visiting defense before firing home. To complete a miserable afternooon for Harry Redknapp's side, midfielder Scott Parker was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Vermaelen as Tottenham finished the match with 10 men. The result leaves Tottenham seven points ahead of Arsenal, who go back above Chelsea on goal difference, although Spurs are now eight points behind second placed Manchester United -- who closed the gap on Manchester City to just two points after a late 2-1 victory at Norwich on Sunday. City continue to lead the table on 63 points, with United still breathing down their necks in second after veteran pair Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs proved the difference against a determined Norwich side. Scholes, who came out of retirement this season at the age of 37, opened the scoring in the seventh mimute with a close-range header at the back post. But Norwich looked to have rescued a point seven minutes from time when Grant Holt fired home after his turn out-witted Rio Ferdinand. But 38-year-old Giggs, playing in his 900th competitive match for United, celebrated that milestone with a stunning winner, volleying home Ashley Young's cross in the second minute of injury time. Meanwhile, at Wembley Stadium, Liverpool defeated Championship side Cardiff City 3-2 on penalties to win the English League Cup, manager Kenny Dalglish's first trophy since returning to the club. Joe Mason had given Welsh club Cardiff a shock half-time lead but Martin Skrtel thumped home from close range after the break. Substitute Dirk Kuyt looked to have given Liverpool victory in extra time, but a late Ben Turner goal sent the match into a dramatic penalty shoot-out. Steven Gerrard and Charlie Adam missed Liverpool's first two spot-kicks, but Cardiff conspired to miss three of their own -- two of them hitting the post. In an ironic twist, the final penalty miss was by Cardiff defender Anthony Gerrard, the cousin of the Liverpool captain.",

        "article": "By . Kristie Lau . Rising star: Blogger Bryan Grey Yambao, a.k.a. Bryanboy, pictured, has confirmed he will join the cast of America's Next Top Model . Bryan Grey Yambao, more commonly known as Bryanboy, will join the cast of America's Next Top Model. The 31-year-old fashion blogger, who launched his site in 2004, wrote on his Facebook this morning: 'Excited with my new role on cycle 19 of America's Next Top Model'. Although the CW network is yet to confirm how the blogger, who had lived in the Philippines, will be involved, he has already relocated to Los Angeles in order to film the reality series created by model Tyra Banks. He posted a photograph of his new Los Angeles apartment on Twitter yesterday. The new signing follows news that Ms Banks, 38, dumped the show's previous judges, fashion photographer Nigel Barker, runway coach J. Alexander and make-up artist Jay Manuel, last month. She told Access Hollywood: 'We reached a point, where we feel the show needs a new boost.' While many TV stars, such as Brooke Bourke and Katherine Heigl, have turned to blogging after building successful careers, it is the first time a blogger will become a TV star. His appointment had been hinted at for months. Mr Grey Yambao, who was raised in Manila, declined an interview with\u00a0The Observer in February because he was not able to participate in any 'profiles pending a project with another media outlet' that 'would be developed/released by this summer'. The new season of America's Next Top Model is about to commence filming in Los Angeles shortly. Sources close to the blogger had told\u00a0WWD yesterday that the blogger had signed a contract with the show and was 'en route to Los Angeles with a one-way air ticket'. He will join new cast members Rob Evans, a U.S. model and Johnny Wujek, a stylist for Katy Perry. Fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone will also return as a judge for a second season. Mr Grey Yambao wrote on Twitter on May 22: 'A new chapter is about to begin soon.' Old judges: The blogger's involvement comes after the show's creator Tyra Banks, left, dumped Nigel Barker, middle, and Jay Manuel, right. It is unclear what role the new recruit will play in the reality series . New judges: Model Rob Evans, left, will also join the series as will Johnny Wujek, right, Katy Perry's stylist . He also tweeted yesterday: 'Let the public voting commence \u2013 California State ID or New York State ID?' Although Bryanboy was never directly tied to it, the blogger is believed to have been behind the controversial gossip blog titled Chikatime. According to The Observer, the Manila-based blog 'combined Perez Hilton's fondness for coke-y MS Paint doodles with TMZ's gutter ruthlessness with 2005-era Gawker's weakness for the unverified and unverifiable, juicy reader tip'. Many of the blog's subjects were people who were associated with the blogger. An anonymous former editor of Bryanboy said of the blogger's supposed involvement: 'It was just common knowledge in Manila among those who were in the know.' According to\u00a0New York magazine, the blogger earns more than $100,000 per year. He charges fees for appearances, telling the magazine: 'But if it's something or somebody that I support, then of course I'm not going to charge. 'For me money is really not the issue, it's about getting material and getting my content.' Using the alias Bboy777, he joined the blogosphere in 2003 and eventually built a following for himself after posting stories about his weight-loss goals, fashion purchases and hatred for fake designer goods. Both are themes that feature on his newer blog. He wrote a short-lived fashion column for a publication called the Philippines Star and he also guest-judged the Philippines' version of Project Runway. He has built impressive connections since setting his sights on the U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is just one magazine editor who has commissioned street style photographs off the blogger. New digs: The blogger tweeted this picture with the caption, 'My building to the left... my street view to the right' Success: His blog Bryanboy.com, above, is said to attract an average of 1.4million pge views every month . Fashion bible Style.com also featured his photography during the Fall/Winter 2012 Fashion Week season earlier this year. His blog, which features his witty commentary on fashion as well as photographs and self-portraits is said to average 1.4million page views per month.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The cardiac arrest leading to Joan Rivers' death happened as the comedian's personal doctor began performing a biopsy on her vocal cords, a source close to the death investigation told CNN. A staff member at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic told investigators that the doctor, who has not been publicly identified, took a selfie photo in the procedure room while Rivers was under anesthesia, the source said. Rivers, 81, was at the clinic for a scheduled endoscopy by another doctor, gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen. That procedure, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. After Cohen, the clinic's medical director, finished his work, a biopsy was done on Rivers without her prior consent, according to the source. An ear, nose and throat specialist not certified by the clinic as required by law performed a biopsy on her vocal cords. The doctor is described by the source as Rivers' personal ear-nose-throat physician. Clinic: Vocal-cord biopsy did not kill Joan Rivers . \"Even though you are a licensed physician, you still should have, if you will, the checks and balances to get your approval to practice in that particular place,\" said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center. Investigators believe that Rivers' vocal cords began to swell during the allegedly unauthorized biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest on the morning of August 29, the source said. Rivers, 81, was rushed by paramedics from Yorkville Endoscopy to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she died a week later. Yorkville Endoscopy issued a statement last Thursday denying reports that any vocal cord biopsy has ever been done at the clinic, although federal privacy law prevented any patient information from being released. The day after the denial was issued, the clinic confirmed that Dr. Cohen \"is not currently performing procedures... nor is he currently serving as medical director.\" The source said that at this time neither Cohen nor the ear, nose and throat doctor have been accused of wrongdoing by investigators. The clinic declined to respond to the source's comments about a biopsy or a selfie, citing federal privacy law. Timeline emerges in Joan Rivers' death .

        "article": "Chelsea continued their attack on Premier League referees after the club's\u00a0official website published an article complaining that they have not been awarded enough penalties this season. The piece called 'penalty puzzle' analysed how many spot-kicks the Blues have been given in each of the last five years. The argument, that the number is 'abnormally low', echoes manager Jose Mourinho's view that there is a 'campaign' against the club. Chelsea were angered last weekend by referee Mike Dean's refusal to award Branislav Ivanovic a penalty . Referee Dean had some tough calls to make in Chelsea's draw with Southampton but made most correctly . Chelsea have been awarded five penalties in eight Champions League games, including against PSG . The 'penalty puzzle' article leads the way on Chelsea's official website . At Old Trafford in October defenders John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic were denied a spot kick despite being wrestled to the ground. Former Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas was tripped during Chelsea\u2019s game against Southampton at St Mary\u2019s Stadium, but instead he picked up a yellow card for diving. Jose Mourinho\u2019s side appealed for a penalty against London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, only for the north London side to get away with handling the ball in their own box. A blocked arm again denied the current Premier League leaders at home to Burnley despite the shot being clearly stopped by a raised arm. Ivanovic was again left perplexed last Sunday at Stamford Bridge when visitors Southampton got away with yet another clear penalty against the Blues. The article, with no byline, comes after Branislav Ivanovic was denied a penalty in last weekend's draw with Southampton, an incident the Chelsea website described as 'a clear spot-kick'. However, general consensus, as outlined by Sportsmail's Graham Poll, was that the contact on Ivanovic, while undoubtedly present, was too slight to spot with the naked eye. The article also notes that Chelsea have received five penalties in just eight Champions League games, which they cite as evidence that the 'campaign' is limited to Premier League officials. Mourinho has been vociferous in his criticism of officials all season, first suggesting there was a campaign against his team in December, before appearing on Sky Sports last month after a challenge by Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Nemanja Matic went unpunished. It is not the first time in recent weeks that the club's online team have sought to back up their manager's controversial view. Jose Mourinho first brought up the 'campaign' against his side after a draw at Southampton in December . Mourinho's players came under fire when nine of them surrounded referee Bjorn Kuipers against PSG . Click HERE to read what chief sports writer Martin Samuel had to say when he covered the subject in his colum last month . Last week the official Chelsea Instagram account posted historic pictures of Sportmail columnist Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness arguing with referees, after Mourinho accused them of having short memories. Carragher had described the Chelsea players' behaviour against PSG, when nine of them surrounded the referee, as 'disgraceful'. Mourinho appeared on Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday to discuss referees last month . Nemanja Matic (centre) was sent off after reacting to a challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes last month .",

Doctors in Portland are searching for the cause of an 18-year-old girl's worsening illness that has taken her legs and is now threatening to take her life. Tabitha Schulke, 18, began experiencing flu-like symptoms on Thanksgiving morning. Suddenly, her illness worsened and she began developing gangrene on her feet. She's now fighting for her life in the critical care unit of a Portland Hospital. 'They looked like she'd been out in the snow, like they turned black,' Katie Zimmerman, the teen's aunt, told ABC News affiliate KATU. Scroll down for video . Mystery illness: Tabitha Schulke, 18, began experiencing flu-like symptoms on Thanksgiving morning. Suddenly, her illness worsened and she began developing gangrene on her feet . Critical care: As she fights for her life in a critical care unit, doctors are beginning to think she may be suffering from toxic shock syndrome, a disease with a 50 percent chance of survival caused by staph infections . Fighting for her life: Doctors told her family that she would die of the mystery illness, as they felt there was little they could do to saver her . Doctors told her family that she would die of the mystery illness, as they felt there was little they could do to saver her. 'They told the family that she was going to die, that you need to come say goodbye,' said Amber Shoebridge, public relations officer at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center. But a specialized emergency team at Legacy Emanuel was able to stabilize her with 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,' a technology that provides support to patients whose heart and lungs are severely damaged and cannot function on their own. The gangrene continued to spread, however, and surgeons were forced to amputate Schulke's legs at each knee. As she fights for her life in a critical care unit, doctors are beginning to think she may be suffering from toxic shock syndrome, a disease with a 50 percent chance of survival caused by staph infections. The condition can be triggered after a cut or wound becomes infected. Women who are menstruating or using barrer contraceptive devices are more likely to contract the disease. Lab studies will confirm whether Schulke's infection was caused by toxic shock. Schulke's doctors told ABC News that while she is still in critical condition, they are hopeful that she'll recover. Survival: Katie Zimmerman, the teen's aunt, said: Just her surviving, that's all that matters. Not Christmas, not anything, just... we want Tabi' 'She's improving very much so,' Shoebridge said. 'She's a little more responsive than she had been.' Zimmerman said Shulke has responded by squeezing her hand when she asks her to give her a sign of whether she is in pain. Crying, Zimmerman told ABC, 'She's beautiful on the outside, but she's even more beautiful on the inside.' Schulke, who is now covered in hospital machines, is a Sunday school teacher and she wants to be a missionary. 'Just her surviving, that's all that matters,' Zimmerman said. 'Not Christmas, not anything, just... we want Tabi.' Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.",

Ni Min, 14, suffers from the condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), sometimes referred to as Stone Man Syndrome. It is so rare, there are fewer than 600 cases in the entire world - and Ni is one of the youngest. The teenager, from a village near the city of Yibin, in southern China's Sichuan Province, began showing symptoms at the age of eight - and saw a succession of doctors before being diagnosed. Her family had become concerned about the strange lumps that were appearing under her skin and her gaunt appearance. Finally, specialists at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai revealed she was suffering from Stone Man Syndrome. The disease, which has no cure, is considered one of the most disabling genetic conditions. It causes\u00a0bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues. Over time, this extra bone progressively restricts movement, forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone. It eventually results in a gruesome death when the  cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe. The patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen. The most famous case of the syndrome was in a man called Harry Eastlack, who began to suffer at the age of 10. By the time he died at 39, his body had almost completely turned into bone, leaving only his lips intact. Mr Eastlack asked that his body be donated to researchers looking for a cure for the illness after his death. People with the syndrome need to be careful to avoid injury. Any swelling or inflammation will be quickly 'repaired' by the body by replacing the tissue with bone. If the extra bone growth is surgically removed, the body will replace the removed bone at a faster pace as well. Despite the poor prognosis, doctors treating Ni say they hope to delay the onset of her symptoms, in a bid to prolong her life. Scroll down for video . The disease, which has no cure, is considered one of the most disabling genetic conditions. It causes bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues . Over time, this extra bone progressively restricts movement, forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone. \u00a0It eventually results in a gruesome death when the cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe . Dr Zhang Keqin, who is leading her treatment, said: 'At present her condition is not very serious and we have prescribed medicine for her. Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva is one of the rarest, most disabling genetic conditions known to medicine. It causes bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues. Ridges of extra bone develop across joints, progressively restricting movement and forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone. There are no other known examples in medicine of one normal organ system turning into another. FOP eventually results in a gruesome death when the  cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe. Patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen. 'We will see how that goes over the next six months and will review it based on the way her body reacts.' The family have been given further hope now a new medicine for treating FOP is under trial in the U.S. It is expected to hit the market next year. Dr Zhang added:\u00a0'We hope this new drug will help. 'Patients usually die in their 40s when they can no longer breathe because of the pressure on their lungs.' Ni Min's grandmother, Li Yuanchao, 65, has been a tireless campaigner for her granddaughter, taking her to medical appointments across the country in the hope of a diagnosis - and a cure. Over the past six years, she has spent her life savings, and her 68-year-old husband is working away from home in another city to earn more money to pay her medical expenses. Ni says if a cure is ever discovered, she is determined to become a doctor herself and help others\u00a0recover from the illness. The organisation\u00a0journalismwithoutborders.com is collecting money for Ni.",

        "article": "In the first glimpse inside the Cairns \u00a0'house of horrors', where eight children  were stabbed to death, neighbours have described the kids as pranksters who made everyone smile. Among the children who were brutally murdered there was a shy, grade-A student who loved rugby\u00a0league,\u00a0a teenage tomboy whose favourite colour was pink and a beautiful baby girl, who was the apple of the family's eye. The children, who lived with their mother at 34 Murray St, Manoora, were brutally murdered on Friday in a horrific massacre, which has\u00a0devastated\u00a0the small community. Scroll down for video . Malili (standing left) and Daniel (standing right), along with (sitting, from left) Rayden, Petronella, Rodney and (far right) Azariah were allegedly killed by their mother. A cousin (second from right) is not a victim . Their mother, Mersane Warria, was taken to hospital and has since been charged with their murder after\u00a0allegedly\u00a0stabbing and suffocating seven of her children to death, along with her niece. The 37-year-old local woman was charged with eight counts of murder, and appeared before a magistrate in a bedside hearing at the Cairns Base Hospital this morning. The woman was remanded in police custody, and currently remains in hospital. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Jade, a neighbour of the family, gushed about the little kids while struggling to come to terms with the tragedy. Angelina Thaiday (right) was also killed in the brutal massacre on Friday. She was the niece of\u00a0Mersane Warria who has been arrested for the murders . 'They were such pranksters those boys. In a good way - they were funny. They made everyone smile,' she said. 'They'd hide in this tree and get me with a super soaker - they'd spray me with the water gun and laugh and laugh.' Speaking about the youngest four boys, Daniel, Rodney, Rayden and 'Az' she explains how they often came to her door alone, asking 'can we see your dogs?' 'They'd ride my big dog around like it was a horse - they were sweet little boys.' She couldn't find words to explain the little child, Petronella, who was just two years old when she was killed. 'She was so little... Just a little baby,' she said. Cristal Atkinson, who babysat for the family for two years, has fond memories of the children,\u00a0remembering\u00a0their\u00a0love for playing in the local park and watching Disney movies. Speaking to the\u00a0Courier Mail\u00a0Ms Atkinson spoke about two-year-old Petronella, who was doted on by her older siblings. She said they found it hard to pronounce her long name, so they called her 'Baby Girl'. 'Everybody doted on her because she was the baby,' she said. The eight children who were stabbed to death in the Cairns 'house of horrors' have been described as loving kids who were full of laughter and were always dancing and singing . Among the children who were brutally murdered there was a shy, grade-A student who loved rugby league, a teenage tomboy whose favourite colour was pink and a beautiful baby girl, who was the apple of the family's eye . A woman, believed to be a member of the family, is visibly upset as she visits the scene of the stabbing in Manoora in Cairns . 7-year-old Rayden was the academic one of the bunch, receiving A-grades in every class. However he was 'very quiet' and shy, preferring to stay in the background and let his siblings take the limelight. Younger brother Daniel, was the complete opposite to Rayden and was the joker of the group. 'He'd spray whipped cream on my hand when I was asleep and push it towards my nose. He was a really happy, fun-loving kid,' she said. Ms Atkinson was closest to 14-year-old Malili, who went to\u00a0Trinity Bay State High. The teenager has been described as a tough girl who loved pink and AFL. 'She was a solid girl \u2013 you wouldn't want to mess with her \u2013 who played rugby league and loved AFL. But her favourite colour was floral pink and I bought her a bright pink shirt for Christmas.' Neighbour, Jade, told Daily Mail Australia that she couldn't understand why the 37-year-old mother didn't ask for help before her stabbing rampage. 'I would have tea with her and say 'I don't know how you do it, looking after nine kids with all those little ones,' she said. 'And Raina would say 'you just do it. You love them so you do it. There is not other option.' 'How did this happen? How didn't I see the signs? Why didn't she ask for help? She had so many friends. She has such a big family. The help was there.' Family members mourn at the scene of a memorial which is located in the park next to the home of the multiple stabbing . A family member fell to the ground as he visited the makeshift shrine to the eight children who were brutally murdered in the house . A floral tribute has been set up in the park across the street from the children's house . Sitting at the base of the willow tree where an incredible display of flowers, teddy bears, paintings and heartfelt tributes have been left, Jade said she couldn't bring herself to be angry with the mother of nine. Less than 15 metres away, there are constant flashes as criminal/forensic investigators photograph the evidence in the room where the children were brutally murdered. 'They keep dying, I can't do it,' she says while trying to light candles for the children. 'It's just stupid meaningless candles but I have to do something. I can't stop thinking about it, I don't know what to do.' Jade said she could not bring herself to be angry at the mother. Instead, she is troubled and worried that she hadn't noticed a problem with Raina. 'She never complained. Never complained about anything. She took such good care of those kids. 'There were parties but no more than other people here. 'The kids were always sleeping at friends and neighbours and family's houses - why couldn't she ask them for help instead of this? How could she do this? A police forensic officer can be seen entering the house in which eight children were stabbed to death in the Cairns suburb of Manoora . This is the house in Manoora where the eight children, ranging from 18-months-old to 14-years-old were stabbed to death . Residents of Manoora have been left devastated by the tragic incident, as police continue their investigations at the 'house of horrors' The whole community of Manoora have been shocked by the multiple stabbings. Many mourners have a laid flowers, toys and even food at a floral tribute set up in the park across of the road from the children's house. Neighbours revealed the erratic behaviour of Mersane Warria hours before they were found dead in their house by their 20-year-old brother Lewis Warria. Ms Warria, 37 was seen by neighbours running through the street screaming at 3am on the morning the bodies were found. She approached a group of children and 'had a go at them', according to one community member. After her confrontation with the youngsters she wandered back towards her home. Only hours before her outburst, neighbours recalled seeing Ms Warria clearing out her home with her children. The mother was heard telling neighbours that she wanted a 'fresh start'.

America\u2019s newest soccer hero is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn\u2019t expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it two nights before. John Brooks got the American soccer team\u2019s World Cup off to a flying start after coming on as a second-half substitute and scoring an 86th minute winner from a corner. The goal means he is the first American sub to ever score in a World Cup match and afterwards he revealed that he\u2019d had a premonition that his big moment was about to arrive. America's newest soccer hero, John Brooks, is a German-born 21-year-old who wasn't expected to take part in Monday's night but who claims he knew he was destined for glory after dreaming about it . Brooks was born in Berlin, his father was a American serviceman father from Chicago and his mom is German . \u2018I told some teammates that I dreamed that I scored in the 80th minute and we won the game,\u2019 he said afterwards. \u2018And now it was the 86th minute and we won.\u2019 One of the surprise picks by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, Brooks hadn't been in the starting lineup for the World Cup opener against Ghana. But after central defender Matt Besler felt tightness in his right hamstring during the final five minutes of the first half, Klinsmann sent the 21-year-old Brooks on for the start of the second half. Just four minutes after Andre Ayew's 82nd-minute goal wiped out a lead Clint Dempsey had given the U.S. just 29 seconds in, Brooks outjumped Ghana's John Boye to meet Graham Zusi's corner kick and bounced an 8-yard header past goalkeeper Adam Kwarasey. Brooks, who has both German and American citizenship, revealed after the match that he had had a dream about scoring a header from a corner late in the match . United States' John Brooks, second from left, scores his side's second goal during the group G World Cup soccer match between Ghana and the United States at the Arena das Dunas in Natal, Brazil, on Monday . It wasn't just a dream! United States' John Brooks is mobbed by his teammates after scoring their side's winning goal . Overcome with emotion, Brooks ran in disbelief, slumped to the ground arms first and felt teammates pile onto him. When they finally moved off, he put both hands to his lips and blew a kiss. Two nights earlier he had dreamed about scoring a header from a corner kick. 'It was unbelievable,' Brooks said. 'I couldn't believe it.' Brooks, was born in Berlin to a German mother and an American serviceman father from Chicago. The 6ft 4in central defender plays club soccer for his hometown club Hertha Berlin. Brooks has only visited the U.S. for training camps and vacation, but has a tattoos of Berlin and Illinois on his arms. Speaking one day in California last month, he said, \u2018When I'm here, I'm a full American. I play with heart for America.\u2019 After the victory, Vice President Joe Biden visited the American team's locker room and posed with this photo with Clint Dempsey, left, and DaMarcus Beasley, right . Joe Biden congratulates the American team after Monday night's victory over Ghana . He had nerves initially Monday, yet is thrilled with how things ended. \u2018I think the first goal was perfect, a perfect start. Couldn't be better,\u2019 Brooks said. Brooks' moment in the spotlight ensured that after the match his name was trending on Twitter and one over enthusiastic fan updated his Wikipedia entry to read: 'After scoring against Ghana... he is now among the ranks of John F. Kennedy, Chuck Norris and Abe Lincoln as American heroes.\u2019 The comment has since been deleted. As the American Outlaws chanted their way out of the stadium, Brooks missed the chance to meet Vice President Joe Biden when he visited the locker room. Brooks and Jermaine Jones had been chosen for random drug tests. Among the five German-Americans on the 23-man roster, Brooks made his national team debut last August and had only four appearances entering the World Cup. Nearly two hours after the final whistle, Brooks was among the last U.S. players to leave the locker room. Someone asked whether he thinks he will start against Portugal on Sunday. \u2018I don't expect anything,\u2019 he said. \u2018I just give my best in every training session, and we'll see.\u2019 The U.S. team return to their base in Sao Paulo following Monday night's game in Natal at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil .

        "article": "By . Mark Duell and Mario Ledwith . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 18 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:53 EST, 18 December 2012 . Recovering: Nelson Mandela is recovering from an operation to remove gallstones, carried out in a private clinic in Pretoria . Doctors are keeping Nelson Mandela in hospital but insisted today that there is 'no crisis'. The former South African President is recovering in hospital after having an operation to remove gallstones, and a presidential spokesman said he is 'looking much better'. The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, underwent the surgery at a private clinic in Pretoria. President Jacob Zuma said Mr Mandela needed 'extraordinary care' because of his age, and added: 'If he spends more days in hospital, it is because that necessary care is being provided.' He had previously been hospitalised on December 8, suffering from a lung infection. 'Doctors are satisfied that the progress he is making is consistent with his age. They say there is no crisis, but add that they are in no hurry to send him home just yet until they are satisfied that he has made sufficient progress,' presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said. South Africans have been worried about . Mr Mandela's health since he was airlifted to the clinic from his home . in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. While in hospital, tests revealed the . presence of gallstones and it was decided the operation would be carried . out after he had recovered. Gallstones are an accumulation of . crystals in the gall bladder. The condition can become life-threatening . because of the risks of secondary infections such as pancreatitis. Mr Madela's wife previously caused concern when she said his trademark 'spirit and sparkle' was waning. Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband 'fading.' Scroll down for video . Smiling: Mr Mandela made his last public appearance alongside his wife Graca Machel at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium during the closing ceremony for the 2010 World Cup . 'I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,' she told eNews Central Africa. Mr Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition. 'He . has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of . humanity as such', she said. 'At some point you will dependent on . someone else, he has come to embrace it'. The pair's comments were the first official remarks by his family since the former President was rushed to hospital. The anti-apartheid leader is particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years in prison, though medics say he is responding well to treatment. He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned. Medical experts say respiratory . illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter . that require care and monitoring. His ongoing hospitalisation . has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million . people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first . democratically elected president who sought to bring the country . together after centuries of racial division. Tests at 1 . Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the . lung infection, presidential spokesman Mr Maharaj previously said in a statement. Public concern: Broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital where South Africa's former President Nelson Mandela is hospitalised . Security: South African military police officers check cars entering the 1 Military Hospital . 'Madiba is receiving appropriate . treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, . referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa as a . sign of affection. In January 2011, Mr Mandela was . admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially . described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory . infection. The chaos that followed his stay at . that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it . and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his . care and the government control the information about his health. In recent days many in the press and . public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the . government has released about the former president's condition. They had not divulged why he had been . flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests . prompting many to fear the worst. Over the weekend the South African . Sunday Times newspaper quoted a source as saying 'he has not been . talking. He is not looking good'. The country's defence . minister visited the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Pretoria military . hospital in which he is being treated. Afterwards Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula . echoed the official, placatory message, telling reporters that Mr . Mandela was 'doing very, very well'. Rallying round: Worshippers pray at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto. Calls for prayer have been made for former president Nelson Mandela . Bated breath: The nation has been eagerly awaiting news of his condition . She added: 'It is important to keep . him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a . state of panic because I think that is not what all of us need.' Mr Mandela has a history with lung . problems. He fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail-end of . his prison years, after he had been moved from the notorious Robben . Island and to another jail to ease the apartheid government's efforts to . negotiate with him about a possible release. After being taken to a Cape Town hospital, a doctor told him he had water in his lungs. Mr Mandela initially refused to believe the doctor, he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. \u2018With a hint of annoyance, (the . doctor) said, \u201cMandela, take a look at your chest,\u201d\u2019 Mr Mandela . recounted. \u2018He pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger . than the other.\u2019 Surgeons immediately cut into his . chest and removed two litres (half a gallon) of liquid from his lungs, . which tested positive for tuberculosis. Doctors at the time suggested Mr Mandela contracted the disease from his damp prison cell. About 1.4 million people worldwide . die each year from tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which can stay . dormant for years. It also can cause permanent lung damage, though in . his autobiography Mr Mandela says doctors caught it in time. Relations: Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca Machel, at their Qunu home in August . However, tuberculosis can return to . trouble those previously infected, properly treated or not, and previous . damage could have been missed, Openshaw said. Openshaw, who has not seen Mr . Mandela's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients, . said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an . elderly person, though others can strike as well. Mr Mandela was a leader in the . struggle against racist white rule in South Africa and once he emerged . from 27 years in prison in 1990, he won worldwide acclaim for urging . reconciliation. He won South Africa's first truly . democratic elections in 1994, serving one five-year term. The Nobel . laureate later retired from public life to live in his remote village of . Qunu, in the Eastern Cape, and last made a public appearance when his . country hosted the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament. Mr Mandela disengaged himself from . the country's politics over the last decade but continued campaigning . against AIDS. He has grown increasing frail in recent years. He went seven weeks of radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2001, ultimately beating the disease. In February he underwent minor surgery to determine the cause of abdominal pain. Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary . of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca . Machel, at their Qunu home in August. In 2011 Mr Mandela's close friend Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu described him as being 'frail'. The churchman said: 'We want him to remain forever, but you know... anything can happen.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Nude photos and other potentially objectionable materials have been showing up in the iPhone application store in recent weeks, raising questions about Apple's ability to control iPhone content. An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced. In the most recent example, a nude photo of a young woman, reported to be 15 years old, showed up on an iPhone application called \"BeautyMeter,\" according to Wired.com and Krapps.com, an app review site. CNN could not independently confirm the young woman's age. The photo, which apparently was submitted by one of the photo-sharing app's users, prompted Apple to remove the entire mobile application from its online store. Funnymals, maker of the BeautyMeter app, which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on \"hotness,\" says in a statement on its Web site that it agrees with Apple's decision to yank the phone application from its online store. Funnymals also says its policies prohibit people from posting nude photos to the application. Neither Funnymals nor Apple responded to requests for comment. About a week earlier, another mobile phone application, \"Hottest Girl,\" showcased a photo of a topless woman and also was pulled from the iPhone app store. \"Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography,\" an Apple company spokesman said at the time. The explicit material is putting attention on Apple's attempts to filter out potentially objectionable apps before they're posted on its app store. The iPhone app store, with more than 50,000 applications, is the most popular entertainment and information venue of its kind for mobile phones. Observers say the successful app store buoys the iPhone's popularity and adds to Apple's sterling image as a hip and family-friendly company. The explicit content has the potential to tarnish that image. But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store. Some iPhone apps are developed by Apple, but many are submitted for approval by third-party developers. Phil Malone, a clinical professor of law at Harvard Law School, said it's unlikely Apple or app developers could be held liable for potentially illegal content that might show up in phone apps, as long as they didn't know about the questionable content in advance. It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said. As the quantity of new apps and updates for apps increases, it becomes all the more difficult for the company to keep up, said Dan Moren, associate editor of Macworld, a blog about all things Apple. Joshua Topolsky, editor in chief of Engadget, a technology blog, said the impossibility of policing all app store content should free Apple from some blame. \"It's completely out of Apple's control that someone uploaded a nude photo, and to some extent, it's out of the [app] developer's hands as well,\" he said. More pressing, Topolsky said, are Apple's nebulous policies about which apps get the company's stamp of approval. Apple does not tell developers or the public exactly how the decision process works, he said. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this story. The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer. In some cases, applications have been banned from the iPhone app store for showcasing material that also would be easily accessible through iTunes or by using Apple's mobile Web browser. A Nine Inch Nails application, for example, reportedly was pulled by Apple because it streamed a song with offensive lyrics. Band leader Trent Reznor lashed out against Apple on his Web site, calling the company hypocritical and pointing out that the song in question also was available on iTunes. In a similar incident, a Twitter app called \"Tweetie\" was pulled because it gave access to offensive words on Twitter.com. It was later put back on the app store. And an iPhone app that allowed users to shake a digital crying baby to death was yanked from the app store in April. Apple issued an apology, calling the app \"deeply offensive\" and a \"mistake.\" Unlike Apple, which acts as a gatekeeper, Google lets developers post games and other programs to its Android app store without going through a screening process. Brown said he favors this idea, which lets the Android store's community flag objectionable content. Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps. In a recent update to the iPhone software, Apple included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones. iPhone apps now come with age-appropriateness labels, submitted by developers. Moren said this new parental-control system offers \"fine-grained controls\" and helps iPhone owners decide what content they want to buy. The company is doing anything it can to try to keep pornography and offensive material off the site for public relations reasons, he said. \"They'd much rather hang onto their image as a family-friendly company\" than let offensive material in, he said. \"I think they've really cultivated that.\"",

Sentenced: Christine French pocketed over \u00a325,000 in benefits that she was not entitled to while working as a cleaner for footballers David Healy and Steve Harper . A cleaner claimed \u00a325,000 in benefits while working for Premiership footballers who she was stealing from, a court has heard. Christine French, 57, took \u00a320,000 in jewellery from the wives of Sunderland Striker David Healy and Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper, to help pay off debts of \u00a315,000. She pleaded guilty to three counts of benefit fraud at Newcastle Crown Court where she was yesterday given a 12 month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. She trembled in the dock today as the court was told that she had fraudulently claimed between \u00a3100 and \u00a3120 a week while cleaning the homes in Ponteland's Darras Hall estate - a favourite among footballers. Defending her, Susan Hirst, said French was 'robbing Peter to try and pay Paul' after her husband of 30 years suddenly left her in a state of\u00a0 financial chaos. She owed a \u00a310,000 in loans and a further \u00a35,000 in finance. Newcastle Crown Court heard that when she initially began claiming income support and council tax benefit in September 2003, she was entitled to the payments. However, after starting work as a cleaner on August 1 2005, she continued to claim the money, which she was no longer entitled to, until she was sacked after the thefts were noticed in late 2010. James Adkin, prosecuting, said French had fraudulently claimed a total of\u00a0 \u00a325,895.08 while working as a cleaner and offering an ironing service. Miss Hirst said that French currently has \u00a310.80 a week deducted from her benefits to re-pay that amount. She said: 'All of the offences rose from the financial mess she was in. Her husband of 30 years left her suddenly with a huge amount of debt. Life has been a real struggle for her over the last seven to eight years. Trust: French was trusted by the family's of Mr Healy (left) and Mr Harper (right) - and even babysat the Newcastle United goalkeeper's children . 'She has been struggling with depression since her husband left her. This really has ruined her life.' Judge John Evans said that 'she would have faced immediate custody if . the matters had come to light at the same time' as the thefts. She was also given a supervision requirement for six months. In May 2011 Judge Richard Lowden sentenced French to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision for 12 months, after she pleaded guilty to three charges of theft relating to \u00a320,000 worth of rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. At the hearing for the first offence, the court was told that French had fallen prey to the temptation of the 'wealth she was surrounded by' and pocketed jewellery belonging to the wives of Mr Harper and Mr Healy. The self employed cleaner sold or pawned the stolen items to help pay off her colossal debts. The court heard French was not only trusted to clean the homes of the families, but would also babysit the Harper's children. French was confronted and admitted what she had done. Because she owned up so quickly \u00a314,000 worth of jewellery was recovered from pawn shops and jewellers where she had taken them.",

        "article": "By . Brad Gilbert . Andy Murray says he will have studied some videos ahead of his match against Rafael Nadal and I am pretty certain what three of those showreels will have been. One will have been the first set he played against the Spaniard in last month\u2019s Italian Open quarter-finals, which he won 6-1 and was, in my view, the best tennis Andy has ever played on clay. Two others will be the most recent victories of Novak Djokovic over Nadal \u2014 in April\u2019s Miami final and the Italian final two weeks last Sunday. These were masterclasses in how to beat the world No 1. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Mike Dickson preview the semi-finals in Paris . Post-match: Andy Murray congratulates Rafael Nadal after the Spaniard beat him in Rome last month . Preparing: Murray plays a forehand during a practice session on Thursday as fitness trainer Matt Little looks on . The orthodox wisdom has been that the best way to play the great Spaniard is to go more to his backhand, but that has changed in my view and Djokovic, who has beaten him in their past four meetings, has had a lot of success hitting hard to Nadal\u2019s supposedly stronger forehand side. Over the years, Nadal\u2019s backhand has become an incredibly solid shot, partly because he is a natural right-hander. His defence is phenomenal on that wing. Another factor is that Rafa\u2019s biggest weapon of all is the \u2018inside-out\u2019 forehand\u00a0he hits when running around his backhand \u2014 these are both good reasons not to overdo the hitting towards that side of the court. Murray has to take the ball on in the way he did in Rome. At times in that match he really hurt Nadal with his backhand and by hitting hard and flat to him on both sides. It was a contest he could have won. Silverware: Novak Djokovic (right) holds the trophy after beating Nadal in the final of the Italian Open in Rome . I also think you will see the Scot use . the drop shot more than he did against Gael Monfils, who gets fired up . chasing into the net. I have really enjoyed watching Andy over the past two weeks and this is the first time I have seen him with his \u2018mojo\u2019 back since Wimbledon. There have been spells here when he has played superb clay-court tennis, with his movement outstanding and that backhand better than ever. Whatever the result today I think it will put him in extremely good shape for the grass-court season. Feeling good: Murray has played superb tennis on the clay of Paris during his run to the semi-finals . Can he beat Nadal? I do not sense any great vulnerability in the Spaniard, although his serve has not been quite as strong as previously. Clearly he is the solid favourite but if Andy manages to dictate for long enough then he has a chance. A word of warning is that if the predicted hot weather materialises that is good for Rafa, as it will add zip and bounce to his ground-strokes.",

A moneybroker from Kent, England, is being held in a Florida jail after his drunken, violent behavior forced a British Airways flight to make an emergency landing in Orlando. Sean Jude Kelly, 31, is accused of spitting on flight attendants and 'trying to pick fights with every passenger he made eye-contact with' on Sunday following a boozy, week-long vacation in Cancun, Mexico. Kelly sustained injuries to his face after he tried to attack a female Orlando police officer and threatened to kill her as he was being hauled off the plane, authorities said. He shouted 'Let's have a go' as he shadow-boxed in his jail cell, according to reports. Before his March 31 flight to Mexico, he tweeted about taking Valium, an anti-anxiety pill, before takeoff. Flight crews told police that he drank half a bottle of vodka on the plane on Sunday. Resisting arrest: Police say Sean J Kelly sustained these injuries because he tried to fight police several times and resisted arrested after he was hauled off a British Airways flight . Danger: British Airways says it diverted BA2022 to Orlando because Kelly was being disruptive on the flight. The passengers' arrival at Gatwick Airport in London was delayed two hours . Flight BA2202 arrived at London's Gatwick Airport two hours late as a result of the detour to Orlando. The 278 passengers aboard were delayed about an hour while Orlando police officers boarded the plane and took Kelly into custody. An Orlando police report reveals Kelly had consumed half of a 750ml bottle of Stolichnaya Vodka on board the plane when he became violent. Pictures from his Facebook and Twitter feed show that he spent his vacation at a Cancun boozing heavily. 'Sunday night rolled into Monday day knocking back daquiris and blasting Mexicos finest ;-) I failed man, as you will see..,' he he wrote on Tuesday. On Thursday, he posted a photo on Facebook of himself holding a half-finished frozen daiquiri. Fear of flying: Before his flight to Cancun, Mexico, Kelly tweeted that he had taken anti-anxiety pills . On holiday: Kelly posted this picture of himself with a half-finished daiquiri in Cancun on Thursday . Before his Mexican holiday, he tweeted about his nerves on the plane. On March 29, he sent a tweet to the British rapper Wiley saying: 'listening to 'Daiquiris' and popping Valiums, only way to get through take off..#madfearofflying #cancun #rattlingwithpills' Earlier he said: 'Looking forward to bricking it for the next 11 hours on a plane. If it goes down, I want (British Pop Idol finalist Rik Waller) singing at my funeral #cancun.' The captain of the British Airways jet landed in Orlando about 8pm, less than three hours after takeoff from Cancun. Fighty: Police said Kelly, who lists his profession as 'moneybroker,' tried to kick a female police officer . Flight officials told police that Kelly had consumed had spit on flight attendants and had attempted to fight every passenger within his line of sight. As officers carried him off the plane, he began wearing at them. He then looked at a female officer and said 'I'm going to kill you.' As he tried to kick the officer, another swept his leg out from underneath him and dropped him to the floor, smashing his face against the carpet, according to a report. He continued to resist and had to be knocked to the floor once more before being taken to a holding cell at the airport. Once inside, he continued to shout obscenities at police. 'You're dead you fat f***,' he allegedly shouted at officers, while shadow-boxing in his cell. 'Let's have a go.' He is charged with assault on a law enforcement officer and resiting arrest. He is being held on $5,300 bail.",

        "article": "Comedian Andy Zaltzman, pictured, made a joke on Radio 5 Live suggesting there could be a referendum about whether the Queen should be beheaded . A guest on BBC radio made an 'outrageous' joke live on air suggesting there should be a referendum to decide whether the Queen should be beheaded. The shocking comment was made by comedian Andy Zaltzman  during the Christian O'Connell Manifesto show on Radio 5 Live. The remark, played out live at 10am on Saturday, came after the high-profile beheadings of three hostages by ISIS militants and prompted a number of complaints to the broadcaster. A video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines - the third western and the first Briton to be beheaded by the extremists - was released on September 14. The first victim, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August. Weeks later, a video showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff was also released by the Jihadist group. Another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, is still being held hostage by the militants. Zaltzman - described at the start of the show as a 'super satirist' - was one of three guests who were invited on the show to discuss the independence vote in Scotland. The debate, which also included presenter Dougie Anderson and comedian Lucy Beaumont, involved Mr O'Connell - who also presents a show on Absolute Radio - asking the guests what else there could be referendums about. Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded. The excerpt has been removed from the repeat of the show on BBC's iPlayer. Listener Becky Robbins, from London, said: 'It was a completely outrageous thing to say, it really is shocking. 'It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but jokes about beheadings are also insensitive and totally inappropriate. The timing could not be worse. 'This was a live broadcast on a Saturday morning. The BBC really needs to look at itself and take much more care.' A blurb about the show on the BBC states that the presenter and his guests 'rant, cajole, debates and discuss how to make things better, tearing up rules and inventing new ones along the way'. The comment was made on the Christian O'Connell Manifesto, a hour-long show presented by Mr O'Connell, pictured, at 10am on a Saturday . It adds: 'This week's Manifesto is a Scottish independence referendum special - now the results are in, how can we make Scotland better?' After the incident, a BBC spokesman said: 'The Christian O'Connell Manifesto is a light-hearted entertainment programme. 'The comment was made by a guest - comedian Andy Zaltzman - and we have received five complaints.'",

        "article": "A body found near a river south of Seattle, Washington is that of missing actress Misty Upham, who disappeared nearly two weeks ago after telling authorities she was suicidal, according to police. Upham, 32, a Native American actress who earned wide praise for her roles in movies including August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained, was last seen on October 5 near a relative's home in Auburn, Washington. The actress had returned to the Seattle-area to help care for her father, Charles Upham, who suffered a stroke last year. It was Misty's father Charles Upham who identified the lifeless body as his own daughter and told the authorities, reports US Weekly. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The dead body of Misty Upham, 32, who was missing since October 5, was found on Thursday . Shortly after her disappearance, Upham told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder. Auburn police had responded to a suicide call at Misty Upham's residence in the days before she was last seen, authorities said. Her father previously said he did not believe she was suicidal. The identity of the body discovered Thursday near the White River, about 30 miles south of downtown Seattle, is confirmed as Misty Upham but the cause of death is still unknown. It took just over five hours to identify the body. The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Seattle-based filmmaker Tracy Rector who said that Misty Upham's uncle, Robert Upham, organized a search party to look for the missing actress three days ago. 'We waited at the site where the team found the body,' Rector told The Hollywood Reporter. 'It took about five-and-a-half hours to confirm. Then we gathered around her body to say prayers and now we're all gathered at the church.' Mr Upham told the MailOnline late Wednesday that he was frantic to find his daughter and felt that media attention had focused on her glamorous days on the red carpet and not her as a 'normal person.' He said the actress, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, had cut off her long locks before she went missing. He denied his daughter would ever go through with a suicide. He told KIRO-FM that Misty was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication. 'It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,' he said. He added: 'She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,' he said. 'She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.' Despair: Misty's father Charles (left) had been critical of the police search for his daughter. Police had received a suicide call to his home in Auburn, Washington. But when they arrived, she had disappeared . Where is Misty? Upham's parents had been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters . Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter. She attributed it to her Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' she said. This was not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence. People magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls. Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her death. A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent. Police received a suicide call on October 5, but when officers arrived, she was no longer at her father's house. A day later, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.' The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today. Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her. In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen. Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.' Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick. Movies: Upham recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County' which starred Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. But she had won an award for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River'",

        "article": "The \u00a3653million spent on drugs to stave off a flu pandemic was \u2018money thrown down the drain\u2019, a damning report found yesterday. The drugs \u2013 Tamiflu and Relenza \u2013 were stockpiled at huge cost by health chiefs in the hope they could stem the effects of a pandemic. The mass purchase was triggered in 2005 when Government scientists warned that as many as 700,000 Britons could die from deadly bird flu. The mass purchase of Tamiflu and Relenza was triggered in 2005 when Government scientists warned that as many as 700,000 Britons could die from deadly bird flu . After millions of doses were stockpiled, spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 virus) in 2009, the first pandemic in 40 years. The anti-viral medicines were purchased to reduce admissions to hospital and dangerous complications from flu such as pneumonia. But the drugs work no better than remedies such as paracetamol, according to an analysis by researchers. There are also claims that vital information from clinical trials was withheld from regulators, researchers and doctors. The report, which analysed data from published and unpublished trials, concludes there is no evidence to show that the drugs reduce hospital admissions or complications. It also says the two drugs do shorten the symptoms of flu but only by half a day \u2013 about the same as some over-the-counter drugs. The review by Cochrane, an independent, international network of researchers, also found Tamiflu had side effects including a higher risk of psychiatric and kidney symptoms. The authors of the report, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), called for an immediate end to stockpiling of the drugs on the basis of the evidence. Dr Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, said: \u2018The money spent has been thrown down the drain. There is no credible way these drugs could prevent a pandemic.\u2019 The drugs worked no better at relieving symptoms than over-the-counter medicines but had potential to \u2018cause great harm\u2019, he said. A second author, Dr Tom Jefferson, a clinical epidemiologist, said: \u2018The evidence doesn\u2019t justify stockpiling \u2013 we should stop it.\u2019 The investigators said there had been . \u2018multi-system failure\u2019 which included the role of regulators, the . European Medicines Agency \u2013 which approved licensing of the drug in . Europe \u2013 and the drugs watchdog Nice. Spending on the drugs escalated still further with the outbreak of swine flu (H1N1 virus) in 2009, the first pandemic in 40 years . Investigators from Cochrane say the original evidence the drug companies gave to the Government was incomplete. They used a huge amount of data only made available by manufacturers Roche and GlaxoSmithKline after \u2018years of struggles\u2019, said BMJ editor-in-chief Dr Fiona Godlee. The findings, based on 46 trials involving more than 24,000 people, cast doubt on whether the drugs are worthwhile fighting flu and suggest \u2018insufficient grounds\u2019 for using Tamiflu as a preventive measure. Roche said it \u2018fundamentally disagreed\u2019 with the findings. Between 2006-07 and 2012-13 the Department of Health spent \u00a3609million on antiviral medicines, \u00a3473million on Tamiflu and \u00a3136million on Relenza. This includes \u00a374million written off because poor record keeping meant medicines had to be thrown away. The swine flu pandemic claimed 457 lives in the UK between June 2009 and April 2010. There were no human cases of bird flu in the UK. The latest review follows a highly critical report in January from MPs on the Public Accounts Committee which warned that a further \u00a349million was at stake because drugs running out of shelf life were due to be replaced. But the DH confirmed last night that a 2008 contract with Roche meant the drugs had been delivered and the money spent in 2013/14 . But Professor Wendy Barclay, chair in influenza virology at Imperial College London, said other evidence showed the drugs benefited sick pregnant women and stockpiling had been \u2018prudent\u2019. Roche UK medical director Dr Daniel Thurley said: \u2018Roche stands behind the wealth of data for Tamiflu. The report\u2019s methodology is often unclear and inappropriate, and their conclusions could potentially have serious public health implications.\u2019 The Department of Health said: \u2018Tamiflu is licensed around the world for the treatment of seasonal flu and is a licensed product with a proven record of safety, quality and efficacy. We regularly review all published data and will consider the Cochrane review closely.\u2019",

Mazda promises great performance, economy, safety and driving fun when the supermini reaches Britain early next year, priced from around \u00a313,000. The five-door hatchback will be 'clever, comfortable and confident' with 'convention-challenging capabilities', the firm says.

The five-door hatchback will be 'clever, comfortable and confident' with 'convention-challenging capabilities', the firm says . The new Skyactiv-D 1.5-litre engine promises low CO2 emissions of 89g/km. There will be five and six-speed manual verions, plus a six-speed automatic transmission option. Safety features include a blind-spot monitoring system. The 50th anniversary of the Government's first drink-drive campaign this week shows how far attitudes have changed in five decades \u2014 with nine in ten drivers now agreeing that driving after drinking alcohol is wrong. To illustrate this, the Government released some vintage campaign adverts spanning the decades. But when I viewed that first black-and-white film from 1964 \u2014 showing a lively Christmas party and warning how downing four whiskies will double your risk of an accident \u2014 it wasn't the drinkdrive message that hit home. Nor how much fashions have changed. No. It was the voiceover message: 'If he's been drinking, don't let him drive,' followed by the printed strapline: 'Don't ask a man to drink and drive.' With women now accounting for nearly half the motorists on the road, that smacks today like the sort of off-key refrain you'd hear from comedian Al Murray as the Pub Landlord: 'And will that be a Snowball or Babycham for the lady?' Times really have changed. Bad news for cyclists as the latest official road casualty figures show an alarming rise in the number of road users killed or seriously injured. Officials blamed 'warmer weather' for bringing out more 'vulnerable' road users such as cyclists on to the nation's highways. From April to June this year 18 per cent more cyclists were killed or seriously injured than in the same period last year. And for 12 months to June there was a 10 per cent rise in these figures. As it happens, driving the correct way down a one-way crescent in Earl's Court, London, recently, I encountered a middleaged cyclist coming straight towards me. Bravely, for you never know what reaction you might get, I wound down my window and, as he passed, gently pointed out that as he was 'a vulnerable road user' and I was a motorist concerned for his safety, did he realise he was heading the wrong way down a one-way street? 'Oh yes, he replied cheerily, but I don't think that applies to bicycles.' A couple of days later, I took avoiding action to give a wide berth to a female cyclist wobbling down the road with a mobile phone clamped to her ear, clearly oblivious to other road users. Go figure, as the Americans say. A new \u00a31 billion centre for research into the cars of the future has been opened by Business Secretary Vince Cable at one of Britain's top universities. The Government and the car industry are investing \u00a3500 million each over the next decade into the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) at Warwick University. Mr Cable announced a further \u00a332 million for two new projects to research manufacturing technology for electric motors and to develop cleaner internal combustion engines, saying: 'Green technology will drive the cars of the future and UK designers and manufacturers must continue to be leading innovators in this field.' He said the new centre will be 'the hub for projects as diverse as using motorsport braking systems in buses, and streamlining the production of electric motors'. With Ford's best-selling Fiesta leading the way, new car sales accelerated ahead last month . With Ford's best-selling Fiesta leading the way, new car sales accelerated ahead last month with the total for 2014 now well on course to reach a ten-year high. There were 179,714 new registrations last month \u2014 14.2 per cent up on October last year, says industry body the SMMT. Year-to-date sales are up 9.5 per cent over the first ten months of 2013. It's the first time the two million mark has been reached in October since the pre-recession days of 2007, and year-end sales could exceed 2.4 million. Other cars in the top ten for October were the Ford Focus, Vauxhall Corsa, VW Golf, Nissan Juke, Nissan Qashqai, VW Polo, Audi A3, Mini and Vauxhall Astra. Rolls-Royce is to stage a series of free live exhibitions called Inside Rolls-Royce. The first opens on Thursday at the Saatchi Gallery on King's Road, London, and will run for four days before touring major cities around the world next year.

        "article": "Wigan demonstrated their determination to hang on to their Super League crown with a hard-fought 21-6 win over Leeds that lifts them into second place in the table. The Warriors played like champions to establish a 14-0 interval lead and withstood a tremendous second-half fightback from the Rhinos to secure only their second win in five games in front of a Super League best attendance of 20,265 at the DW Stadium. Leeds tasted glory with their long-awaited Challenge Cup success at Wembley a fortnight ago but a fourth successive league defeat leaves them trailing in sixth place with one round left of the regular season and with much to do if they are to complete the elusive double. Premiership: Wigan Warriors kept up the pressure on St Helens with a hard-fought win over Leeds Rhinos . The Rhinos were still without evergreen stalwarts Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow and they had centre Jimmy Keinhorst making his first appearance of the season in place of the suspended Joel Moon. Wigan coach Shaun Wane welcomed back full-back Matty Bowen and second rower Joel Tomkins but was forced into a late change when centre Anthony Gelling pulled out through illness, the versatile Jack Hughes taking his place. Wane also sprung a surprise by recalling 19-year-old wing sensation Joe Burgess after a two-month absence and it was he who opened the scoring on 12 minutes. Bowen was in full flight for the line when Leeds' veteran prop Jamie Peacock cut him down with a last-ditch tackle but in the next set Burgess got on the end of stand-off Blake Green's slide-rule kick to score his 20th try of the season on only his 23rd appearance. Scrum-half Matty Smith added the conversion, the first of four successsful kicks at goal, and picked off a forced pass by Leeds' under-fire full-back Zak Hardaker to race 30 metres for Wigan's second try on 22 minutes. Smith kicked his second conversion and, despite losing his footing, added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to stretch his side's lead to a 14-0, which was a fair reflection of the play in the opening 40 minutes. Dejected: Leeds players looked dejected after their defeat, the fourth they have suffered in a row . Hardaker, under an investigation for alleged homophobic abuse, was roundly booed by the Wigan fans with every touch but he responded well to his blunder and was at the heart of the Rhinos' limited attacking opportunities. They went closest to scoring when second rower Carl Ablett weaved his way to within a couple of feet of the line but generally failed to trouble the Warriors defence up to the break. They were the first to score in the second half but it came in fortuitous fashion after Wigan passing broke down on halfway. Keinhorst hacked the ball ahead and when Ryan Hall beat his England team-mate Josh Charnley to the loose ball Liam Sutcliffe was in support to race over at the corner. Kevin Sinfield's superb conversion made it 14-6 and the Yorkshiremen were suddenly full of confidence. A run of three successive penalties enabled them to pile the pressure on the home side but, with skipper Sean O'Loughlin setting a magnificent example, their defence held firm. When Wigan got their second wind, a dash from industrious hooker Michael McIlorum got centre Dan Sarginson charging for the line and, although the home fans were convinced it was a try, video referee Richard Silverwood ruled the player lost control of the ball. Sinfield kept his side in the game with a clever drop-out that enabled his side to regain possession but the telling moment came 10 minutes from the end when strong-running prop Ben Flower took O'Loughlin's short pass to power his way over the winning try. Smith landed his fourth goal and wrapped up the scoring in the last minute with a drop goal.",

        "article": "The influx of high-tech digital speed cameras has seen the the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 in the last year - the highest number since 2009. Ministry of Justice figures show that a total of 115,549 motorists were fined at least \u00a3100 pounds by magistrates after being caught speeding. The increase has been put down to the \u00a310,000 digital cameras, that no longer require film and can operate 24 hours a day, the\u00a0Telegraph reported. The introduction of high-tech speed cameras has seen the number of motorists trapped surge to 115,000 Britons in the last year . South Wales has seen one of the biggest increases, with the number of people fined tripling last year to 6,491, from 2,181 three years earlier. The number of offenders has also grown in that period by almost 1,000 in both South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and by close to 2,000 in Staffordshire. While London saw the most people fined last year, the figure for the Metropolitan Police area has fallen to 7,736 - its lowest level in five years. Those convicted of a speeding offence must pay a minimum of \u00a3100 and will have three penalty points added to their licences. The total number of motorists caught speeding is believed to be far higher, as the figures only take into account those summoned to court for failure to pay fines and where speed was particularly excessive.

Hugh Bladon, one of the founding members of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'Speeding accounts for less than five per cent of accidents and only takes into account one aspect of how people are driving. 'They (speed cameras) do not measure whether the driver is under the influence of drink or drugs or how roadworthy their vehicle is. What about the other aspects?' The number of motorist caught speeding has reached its highest figure in four years . AA president Edmund King said the introduction of digital cameras mean the devices are now working all day long. He told the Telegraph newspaper: 'It (the rise in speeding fines) is a reflection that cameras are more efficient than ever. 'In the past, cameras in London they would only take valid pictures for a quarter of day and it was pot luck whether you are fined. The cameras are now working 24 hours a day.' Last week the Institution of Engineering and Technology said in the future the speed at which cars can travel may be altered to fit the driver's experience, and the development of driverless cars may mean an end to speeding. 'Within 15 years, we predict that the performance of cars could be altered to fit the driver,' the institution said. 'Speeding may become a thing of the past as cars are likely to be fitted with speed-limiting devices.' This year this year a speed camera in Cardiff generated more than an estimated \u00a3800,000 worth of fines in just six months. According to road safety group GoSafe Wales, the device on the junction of the city's Newport Road and Colchester Avenue caught 13,624 speeding motorists and a further 146 running red lights between January and June. A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: 'Speeding can have devastating consequences and it's right that drivers should abide by the speed limit. These fines were issued at the discretion of the magistrates and show the number of fines issued is in decline across many police force areas.'",

        "article": "By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 17:07 EST, 16 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:54 EST, 16 June 2013 . Sometimes horsing around can be the best therapy. An Illinois non-profit is training miniature horses as therapy animals, and bringing them to nursing homes, schools, hospitals and veteran facilities where they provide comfort to disabled people or those who have suffered trauma. The adorable horses - the size of a golden retriever - are petted, brushed, hugged and loved by the people they visit and the interaction improves their physical, mental and emotional well-being. Comfort: Jodie Diegel, seated, founder of Mane in Heaven, approaches Lunar, the oldest mare of the group, in a wheelchair to desensitize the horse at Dynasty Farm in Lake in the Hills, Illinois . Visits: The horses visit nursing homes, schools, hospitals and veteran facilities to provide comfort and affection to those in need . Jodie Diegel founded Mane in Heaven with her four horses, called Lunar, Turnabout, Mystery and Jenella, and the animals wear tiny rubber-soled shoes made for stuffed toy bears when they go to work. 'It's the same reaction everybody has when they first see the animals,' she says. 'The first three words to come out of their mouths are, \"Oh my gosh!\"' The size of the horses is unexpected, and the fact that they are wearing sneakers and a halter with their name written in crystal \"bling\" across the nose always gets a reaction. 'Aside from looking very cute, they actually provide a functional purpose,' Diegel explains about the little round shoes. Cute: Jodie Diegel, left, and her horses relax with the volunteers for her Mane In Heaven pet therapy organization at Dynasty Farm . Training: Jodie Diegel, left, trains Lara Budmats, treasurer for Mane in Heaven, and Turnabout, a 2-year-old male miniature horse, to be calm around a wheelchair . 'When we go on a linoleum or tile floor at a facility, without something like the sole of a shoe, it would be very slippery for them.' Diegel, her four board members, and the three eldest miniature horses have all passed the evaluation process of Pet Partners, a national organization that determines whether animals and handlers are ready for visits to places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. 'We're founded with the mission to train them as therapy animals,' Diegel says, adding that miniature horses are now also being used as guides for vision-impaired persons. 'What's really exciting is to see my vision and my mission coming to life with these miniature horses.' Tame: Tim Scotellaro, of Crystal Lake, Illinois, walks with a miniature horse at the Mane in Heaven pet therapy organization . Sneakers: Jodie Diegel ties a small round sneaker, meant for a toy stuffed bear, onto the front hoof of Turnabout at Mane In Heaven . She and 43 committed volunteers meet every weekend at Dynasty Farm in Lake in the Hills, where the 'minis' are boarded. There, volunteers get to know the horses and to train to be handlers. Part of the training includes desensitizing the horses so they ignore the natural impulse to flee from danger, like that presented by a rolling wheelchair. The horses are taught to behave in a variety of settings. Diegel laughs and admits that sometimes it's easier to train the horses than the people. 'They are absolutely amazing little animals, she laughs. 'But I am totally amazed at the commitment and ability of our volunteers. It's a joy to watch the interaction.'",

        "article": "A mother who was sent death threats by so-called internet \u2018trolls\u2019 has won a landmark legal case against Facebook. Nicola Brookes was tormented for months by anonymous internet bullies after she left an innocent message of support for an X Factor contestant on the social networking site. She went to police to make a complaint but claimed officers told her to go home. Months of torment: Nicola Brookes was targeted by internet trolls after she messaged her support for X Factor star Frankie Cocozza . Now she has won a legal order forcing Facebook to disclose the identities of the trolls. It is the first time an individual has won such an order and Miss Brookes, 45, hopes to pursue private prosecutions against those responsible for her months of \u2018vicious and depraved\u2019 abuse. Charities said the High Court ruling sent a message to the cyber bullies that their anonymity can be stripped away, leaving them open to prosecution. Campaigners warned that online bullying has become the \u2018weapon of choice\u2019 among children and teenagers, with police and prosecutors failing to keep pace with the changes in technology. Miss Brookes\u2019s ordeal began last November when her daughter told her that an X Factor contestant, Frankie Cocozza, had received hate mail on Facebook. Stung by the cruelty, the mother left a message on his Facebook page, saying simply: \u2018Keep your chin up, Frankie, they\u2019ll move on to someone else soon.\u2019 How it started: Nicola's support for X Factor's Frankie Cocozza led to a horrid hate-campaign against her . Within minutes bullies on the site turned on her, writing vile abuse including \u2018Your [sic] a desperate pedo b****\u2019 and \u2018Ur [sic] a ****ing dog\u2019. More than 100 cruel messages were left in just 24 hours. Miss Brookes said: \u2018Facebook users began deliberately targeting me, writing under my comment that I was a paedophile and hoping that I would die.\u2019 Worse followed when an online bully set up a fake Facebook profile in Miss Brookes\u2019 name, with her photo and personal email address, and used it to send explicit messages to thousands of children, some as young as nine. Some messages falsely described her as a drug dealer, a prostitute and a paedophile and known child abuser, and others attempted to \u2018befriend\u2019 young girls. On Mother\u2019s Day this year, trolls published the single mother\u2019s home address in Brighton. Horrified, she reported the abuse to Facebook and the police, but said officers did nothing to help her. She said one officer told her she could leave a dossier of evidence \u2018but we won\u2019t read it\u2019. Frustrated by their response Miss Brookes contacted lawyers and began legal action to force Facebook to reveal details about her anonymous tormentors. Last week the High Court granted an order compelling the site to disclose the bullies\u2019 names, email addresses and their computers\u2019 internet protocol (IP) addresses, which can be used to determine a computer\u2019s location. Miss Brookes said: \u2018These abusers are not just random people who have nothing better to do with their time. \u2018These are organised people who have been operating on Facebook for years. \u2018I\u2019m going for the strongest possible prosecution against these people. I want them exposed.\u2019 Last month, a survey found that just over half of all internet users have received abuse online or by text message. Only a minority report the abuse to police as many believe it will not be taken seriously. Jibes: Nicola Brookes has her picture posted on Facebook - and someone suggests she has been sending round pictures of child abuse . Offensive: Some more of the abuse that went on Facebook. This page formed part of the evidence that Nicola's solicitors presented to the High Court . Prosecutions under the Malicious Communications Act, which makes it illegal to send grossly offensive messages, have increased three-fold since 2004. There were almost 900 such prosecutions last year but prosecutors accept that only a minority of trolls are brought to justice. Miss Brookes has remained on Facebook despite the abuse and said she was determined not to be bullied into quitting the site. Her legal action would have cost her up to \u00a35,000 but her solicitors Bains Cohen agreed to take the case for free because of her horrific treatment. Lawyer Rupinder Bains said Facebook had not contested the action and had agreed to hand over the information within six weeks. Four individuals were believed to have led the abuse against Miss Brookes and her lawyers will consider private prosecutions against them. If their Facebook accounts were set up using fake names and email addresses, lawyers will have to return to court and win similar orders against the trolls\u2019 internet service providers, to get the bill-payers\u2019 addresses. Rise of the sick internet trolls . Vile: Ms Brookes shows off print outs of some of the abuse she suffered online at the hands of tormenters . Abuse: A false Facebook page that was set-up for Nicola Brookes by the cyber bullies . Mr Bains said: \u2018It should have been the police\u2019s job to get these details from Facebook but they have completely failed in their responsibility to do that.\u2019 Facebook said it reveals its users\u2019 names and email addresses only if a court orders it to do so. A spokesman said: \u2018There is no place for harassment on Facebook, but unfortunately a small minority of malicious individuals exist online, just as they do offline. We respect our legal obligations and work with law enforcement to ensure such people are brought to justice.\u2019 Suzie Hayman, of Bullying UK, said: \u2018Bullies hide behind the anonymity of the internet and they should not be able to do so. You can\u2019t be anonymous if you say something hurtful in the office or the schoolyard and people need to learn you can\u2019t be anonymous on the internet either.\u2019 Sussex Police said they had asked Facebook to remove any abusive posts about Miss Brookes and insisted they were investigating the case. A spokesman said: \u2018We need to gather evidence to prove who the person is for a successful prosecution to take place.\u2019 Insults: Here someone posted Nicola's home address in Brighton where she lives alone (left) while 'Cuthbert Bollingsworth-Smythe' posts more offensive messages .",

Origi, who sealed a \u00a310million switch to Anfield in the summer before rejoining Lille on season-long loan deal, scored just after the interval to put his side 1-0 up. Lille's teenage forward leapt above Nantes' defence to nod home from close range after getting on the end of a cross from team-mate Florent Balmont. Divock Origi is congratulated by his Lille team-mates after his headed effort handed his side the lead . Lille went on to win their  encounter against Nantes thanks to goals from Divock Origi and Marcos Lopes . The Liverpool striker nodded home from close range to score his second league goal of the season . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes Divock Origi will develop into a world class striker . The Belgium international turned from goalscorer to provider three minutes later when Origi set up Lille team-mate Marcos Lopes. Origi has now scored two goals in four league games since joining the Ligue 1 outfit on loan until the end of the season. Brendan Rodgers, who will be keeping a close on Origi's development, labelled the 19-year-old one of the world's most exciting talents when he signed the youngster at the end of July. The Liverpool boss, speaking to reporters shortly after signing Origi, said: 'He has everything to be world class. He's super fast, has a wonderful touch, he's a good size and is aggressive. 'I've seen enough of him over the course of the last couple of seasons to think this is a kid who, coming into the right environment, can genuinely be world class. He can light up world football, for sure.' Divock Origi posed with the Liverpool shirt before completing a move back to former side Lille . The striker will return to Anfield next summer after joining Lille on a season-long loan deal . Divock Origi, pictured with Chelsea's Eden Hazard, scored against Russia at the 2014 World Cup .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said. Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit. Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon. The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot. \"Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,\" the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. \"When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon.\" It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder. But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones. The JetBlue plane was new and would be subject to the rule. The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours. About 3\u00c2\u00bd hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom. By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states. From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit \"and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door,\" according to the affidavit. But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley. Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement. He has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday. A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday. JetBlue has repeatedly praised the first officer, along with an off-duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members. Some passengers have referred to the first officer as a hero. But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label. \"Knowing my son, he would think that he's not a hero. He just did what he was paid to do,\" Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd. \"That's just his job, and he loves his job. He's just a quiet man.\" He called his parents the night of the incident, his mother said. \"He was pretty shaken up, and he couldn't say much.\" The incident took place on a significant date for the family -- the 10th anniversary of the death of Jason Dowd's older sister, who died of cancer, Jean Dowd said. \"I know he was thinking of her, too, at the time this was all going on,\" Dowd said. The incident \"has been earthshaking for us, too,\" she said. \"To lose him would have been terrible for us.\" Jason Dowd, 41, who is married and has two young children, has not made a public statement. He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said. After the incident, the flight made the emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times. \"He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad,\" Judy Osbon said in a statement. \"He also took his piloting very seriously and was very good at it. I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person.\" Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said. Osbon's father, Ronald, who was a pilot, and a passenger were killed in a 1995 airplane crash in Florida, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot radioed he was losing power on both engines and was out of gas. The aircraft crashed near Daytona Beach Regional Airport. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Mike M. Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.",

        "article": "A care home has been fined just \u00a35,000 after a vulnerable pensioner died after suffering from severe burns\u00a0when nurses lowered her into a scalding hot bath. Former hospital matron Beatrice Morgan, 88, suffered the injuries while she was a resident at the Greencroft Care Home in Queensferry, Flintshire in August 2012. It had been expected that Greencroft Care Ltd could have faced a fine in the region of \u00a3100,000 for breaching health and safety rules. Scroll down for video . Beatrice Morgan, left, who died after suffering severe burns when she was lowered into a scalding hot bath by care workers. She has previously worked as a hospital matron, right, at the Wrexham Maelor Hosptial in north Wales . However, at Flintshire Magistrates Court on Thursday, the company was fined just \u00a35,000 after the court heard how they had been in liquidation since last May. District Judge Gwyn Jones also said it was unlikely it would ever be collected. Despite the sanction, owner Timothy Ogunleye, 52, who lives in a \u00a31.6million home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, and has combined assets of \u00a35.7million, remains the director of seven other care homes which can house up to 336 residents. Two are being inspected by the care watchdog. Miss Morgan, from New Brighton near Mold, suffered from dementia and became a resident at the Greencroft Care Home, which specialised in care for the elderly. In September 2012 she died from pneumonia and a blood clot in her lungs caused by the burns at a specialist burns unit at Whiston Hospital, a month after she was lowered into the scalding hot bath. The court heard how the care home had no effective control over the temperature of the hot water at the home, no risk assessment had been carried out, and there had been little staff training. Prosecutor Simon Parrington said Miss Morgan suffered scald burns to her lower legs, trunk and left arm. After the incident thermostatic control mixer valves were fitted at the home. Yesterday Greencroft Care Ltd, pictured, was fined just \u00a35,000 at Flintshire Magistrates Court after breaching health and safety rules . The court heard how the care home had no effective control over the temperature of the hot water at the home . The temperature of the water at the time of the incident was not known but tests on another bath which had not had the new values showed the temperature to be 50.7C. Health and Safety Executive inspector Katherine Walker said that the maximum safe level was 44C. An investigation also showed that there were old values present but they were behind wall panels, had not been maintained and the company did not know they were there. A new value control had been placed on the bath in which Miss Morgan was scalded before she arrived to start her investigation, the inspector added. Judge Jones said Miss Morgan was extremely vulnerable and frail and that the temperature of the bath was not controlled by a correctly adjusted thermostatic valve. Susan Laws, left, and Ann Elliot, Miss Morgan's nieces who said their aunt would have been shocked by the care she received . He added that it was 'a very, very basic requirement \u2013 in fact, a matter of common sense.' He explained: 'The company either did not care for the safety of its residents or it could not be bothered to bring the standards of the home to a minimum standard which would have prevented the potential risks. 'Members of staff were doing their best in difficult circumstances, there was little staff training and little if any staff support. 'There was very little if any staff supervision and no risk assessment. Even the most basic risk assessment did not come until after she was scalded.' The judge also added that there was no bathing policy and improvements had not been carried out because he said 'the company, to put it mildly, did not want to spend.' He said: 'Company directors and senior managers know and ignored the risks. 'It is clear that this company was running an establishment without understanding their responsibilities.' An inspection by the Care and Social Service Inspectorate for Wales raised serious concerns about the dignity and safety of the Greencroft home\u2019s 26 residents, including poor staffing levels and training, cleanliness and security. It went to court to apply for the home\u2019s immediate closure. Miss Morgan had never married and had been proud to work as a matron at the Wrexham Maelor Hospital in Wrexham, North Wales. After she retired, she continued to be active in her local community, where she was described as a feisty lady until she was 80. Miss Morgan's nieces Ann Elliot and Susan Laws travelled from Kent for the hearing and said their aunt would have been shocked at her treatment given the way she had cared for so many people during her nursing career. Mrs Elliot explained: 'It is shocking that she was scalded this way \u2013 it is such a basic caring procedure that everybody does every day. 'They said that they understood the way the judge had to deal with it because the company no longer existed. 'I hope it makes other care homes think of what they are doing. It was such a horrible way to spend her last days.'",

        "article": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Thursday he is sending up to 300 military advisers to Iraq, and could down the road authorize targeted military action, if necessary. Advisers will help train and support Iraqi forces, while gathering intelligence on the militant group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has taken several cities in the north and west of Iraq. Obama said such action was necessary to help prevent a civil war in Iraq that could destabilize the region, and also prevent creation of a terrorist safe haven. One aircraft carrier and five warships are already positioned in the Persian Gulf, U.S. drones are flying intelligence missions over Iraq and military sources tell CNN a list of ISIS targets has been compiled. Special forces teams will arrive in Iraq soon. They could ultimately assist in calling in airstrikes, if they are authorized. \"Going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it,\" Obama said on Thursday. Without deploying combat troops -- which Obama has ruled out -- how could the United States take further military action? Airstrikes: Air power is the most talked about option to target ISIS fighters who have seized cities in northwestern Iraq and could advance into Baghdad. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf, which could facilitate an emergency evacuation of U.S. personnel in Iraq, would also enable missile strikes or bombing. Striking from the air could hamper the movement of ISIS fighters, said Karl Mueller, associate director of the Strategy, Doctrine, and Resources program at RAND Arroyo Center. Airstrikes would \"help stem the advancing tide of ISIS, mainly by striking their forces advancing toward Baghdad or other cities not already under their control,\" he said. Targeted strikes could help shift the momentum from ISIS fighters to Iraqi soldiers and could be highly effective and low risk, Mueller said. As during the 2011 intervention in Libya, ground forces are unlikely to pose a significant threat to U.S. air power and ISIS's air defenses \"would likely be even weaker,\" Mueller said. American bombing would not only give Iraqi forces the upper hand against ISIS, but could provide a much-needed \"psychological boost\" to Iraqi forces after soldiers abandoned their posts in Mosul, which was quickly captured by ISIS. Another benefit? U.S. airstrikes would be achievable without deploying U.S. military personnel near the ground targets, CNN military analyst retired Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks said. While some have raised concerns that an air campaign could result in a high number of civilian casualties, Marks called ISIS a \"very conventional force,\" boasting armored vehicles, artillery and ammo stockpiles. Precision strikes would be difficult to call in without forces on the ground, but the advisers Obama is now deploying could fulfill that task, CNN military analyst Rick Francona said. U.S. special forces would be \"in a great position to call in any air strikes,\" Francona said. Retired Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt called airstrikes \"one of the best guarantees\" to keep Iraq in one piece, but argued that ISIS is more focused on consolidating their gains and may not be interested in pushing into Baghdad. \"It's highly unlikely that they have either the manpower or the capability -- or quite frankly the desire -- to go well south into the southern, predominantly almost exclusively Shia areas,\" Kimmitt said. Drones: What if Obama decides he doesn't want U.S. pilots flying over Iraq at all? Drones have already been at the forefront of the U.S.'s fight against terrorism in the Middle East and perhaps the most recognizable weapon of the Obama administration's policy in countries like Yemen and Pakistan. But drones are best used to strike small, specific targets like vehicles and individual suspected terrorists and several military officials have told CNN that drone strikes would have a limited impact on a force like ISIS. Drones would help U.S. military officials fill the intelligence gap they need to seal in order to strike ISIS precisely, effectively and with limited civilian casualties. Experts and critics have cited the lack of updated military intelligence in ISIS-controlled areas as a hindrance to identifying specific targets. And the Pentagon has ramped up drone surveillance over northern and western Iraq since ISIS took several cities. But some say that is not enough. On the ground, intelligence-gathering: Obama has ruled out sending troops \"back into combat.\" Plans for advisers are similar to those that retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, the former head of Central Command, called for Monday on CNN. \"They can provide some of that ground intelligence ... that we're lacking,\" he said. \"They also can control airstrikes if necessary. They can function as advisers.\" Zinni suggested the elite forces could work with Iraqi forces as well as with Kurdish fighters who recently seized control of the northern, oil-rich city of Kirkuk and are also battling the Islamist militants. Gen. Mark Hertling also called intelligence-gathering essential to distinguish between ISIS fighters and civilians. \"Intelligence is the driver. You can't drop bombs or hit targets without intelligence,\" Hertling said. \"In order to get intel, especially in a nation that's like Iraq, you have to have people seeking that intel on the ground. It just can't come from satellite photos, or an airplane moving at 200 knots above a target and say: 'Hey, that's good enough, let's drop a bomb.'\" To those urging Obama to take swift military action to strike ISIS, Hertling has a message: easier said than done. He urged caution, warning that without more intelligence, U.S. strikes could hit civilians. \"And as soon as the first bomb or the first strafing run hits a school bus or a car full of civilians, then the Americans are to blame for that,\" he said. But sending advisers could just be a first step to a larger U.S. mission in Iraq, experts warned. \"This is the first step. This is how you get drawn into these situations,\" Francona, a CNN military analyst, said. Cooperating with Iran: Obama also said that Iran can play a constructive role in Iraq if it is not \"coming in solely as an armed force on behalf of the Shia.\" Iran deployed about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help the Iraqi government. But Iran's growing influence in Iraq continues to worry experts and U.S. officials as Iran's involvement risks further inflaming sectarian tensions already at a boiling point in the region. As Iranian planes fly through Iraq to arm the Syrian regime and as the war in Syria swells into neighboring countries, experts are warning of a possible regional war between Sunnis and Shiites. To keep Iraq from breaking into pieces, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States would consider communicating with Iran to kill the advance of ISIS militants. Kerry is heading to Iraq for consultations on the situation there. \"We're open to discussions if there's something constructive that can be contributed by Iran,\" he said in an interview with Yahoo News, responding to a question about cooperating with the Iranian military. \"I think we need to go step by step and see what, in fact, might be a reality.\" Kerry clarified Thursday that the United States is only \"interested in communicating with Iran\" and sharing information to prevent mistakes. But the powder-keg situation in Iraq has convinced even one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate to consider working with Iran. \"The Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn't fall,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. Meghan O'Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser, agreed that a coordinated effort in Iraq between the U.S. and Iran might benefit both sides. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress coordination with Iran would not be a first as the United States had previously \"worked with the Iranians on that western border in Afghanistan.\" Others worried that a collaboration with Iran could further alienate Sunni Iraqis who are already weary of the Iraqi government or Iran's regional rivals. House Speaker John Boehner said the U.S. should rule out any partnership with Iran. \"I can just imagine what our friends in the region, our allies will be thinking by reaching out to Iran at a time when they continue to pay for terrorists and foster terrorism not only in Syria, in Lebanon but in Israel as well,\" Boehner said.

        "article": "More than a third of GPs are considering retirement in the next five years, a survey shows. Another one in ten is thinking about moving abroad to countries including Canada and Australia, where the pay is higher and workload less stressful. A poll of 15,560 family doctors also found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether. Choices: A poll of 15,560 family doctors found that one in six is considering going part-time and 7 per cent are contemplating quitting altogether (file picture) Senior GPs say they are facing \u2018incredible\u2019 pressures brought on by an increasingly ageing population who have complicated illnesses, as well as having to chase targets. Their morale is low despite the fact they benefited from a pay deal ten years ago that resulted in their salaries rising by 50 per cent, while allowing them to opt out of working during evenings and weekends. There is now a national recruitment crisis and many surgeries are short-staffed, with increasing numbers of GPs retiring or moving abroad. And they are not being replaced by younger trainees, who view the career as \u2018second class\u2019 compared to more prestigious roles as hospital doctors or surgeons. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last month described the situation as \u2018worrying\u2019 and pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries. The British Medical Association survey, which included GPs in their late 20s through to early 60s, found that 34 per cent were considering retiring within the next five years. 'Worrying': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured) has pledged to alter targets and invest more in surgeries . And a fifth of the 780 trainee GPs included in the poll were already considering moving abroad. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA\u2019s GP committee, said: \u2018This poll lays bare the stark reality of the crisis facing the GP workforce. \u2018It is clear that incredible pressures on GP services are at the heart of this problem, with escalating demand having far outstripped capacity. \u2018GPs are overworked and intensely frustrated that they do not have enough time to spend with their patients, especially the increasing numbers of older people with multiple and complex problems.\u2019 Last month, figures showed the number of GPs applying to work abroad had increased by 40 per cent in five years. The most popular destinations are Australia, New Zealand and Canada where they can earn the equivalent of \u00a3200,000 a year and have more of a work-life balance. GPs in England earn an average of \u00a3105,000 a year, and many take home considerably more. But they claim they often work 12-hour days or longer, and that ten-minute appointment slots are not sufficient to meet patients\u2019 needs. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said the shortage of family doctors could have a \u2018devastating impact\u2019 on the future of the NHS.",

        "article": "By . Darren Boyle . A veterinary nurse has received a suspended jail sentence after abandoning her starving dog on a Birmingham street, before it was later put down. A court heard Ann Marie Nash\u2019s emaciated five-year-old bulldog, Martha, had suffered for a 'prolonged' period. Nash, 38, from Erdington, Birmingham was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment, suspended for a year, after previously admitting animal cruelty. Former veterinary nurse Anne Marie Nash received a suspended jail sentence at Birmingham Magistrates Court after admitting animal cruelty . Nash left her starving and emaciated bulldog Martha in the gutter after putting out the rubbish . She was also ordered to do 100 hours unpaid work, pay \u00a3200 costs and was banned from keeping any animal for five years. Julia Kettle, prosecuting for Birmingham City Council, said the bulldog was found collapsed in St Thomas Road, Erdington, on July 10 last year by a dog warden, who had been called out by a concerned member of the public. She was found to be extremely emaciated and had a swollen stomach and ingrowing nails. The dog was later examined by a veterinary surgeon who discovered a 'football size' lump in its stomach, which was believed to be a tumour. Miss Kettle said a medical examination indicated the animal had been suffering for about two weeks. After the dog was put down, a post mortem examination revealed it had a blockage of bones in its stomach. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard that Nash could no longer afford to care for Martha after losing her job and had to rely on food banks to feed herself . Attempts to find the owner led to a rescue centre and then to Nash. When quizzed the defendant claimed she had given Martha away two weeks previously. Joanne Outhwaite, defending, said Nash, who had completed her veterinary nurse training 14 years ago, was extremely remorseful for what had happened. She said she started to suffer from depression seven years ago following the death of her father, had lost her job and found it difficult to cope. Under stress Nash had taken out the rubbish, Martha had followed her and she had then shut the door on the dog. She had hoped someone would take her in, her solicitor claimed. Investigators from Birmingham City Council were able to track down Nash as Martha had been micro-chipped. Ms Outhwaite told Birmingham Magistrates' Court that her client had been caring for the dog in an appropriate manner until she had lost her job. 'Miss Nash is extremely remorseful and will remember what has happened for a long time to come. 'She took the dog on because of her position fostering animals. Things started to come to a head when she lost her job and she started suffering from depression. 'She was forced to rely on food banks, was facing eviction and was struggling to maintain her own health. 'She accepts that she should have sought assistance and she sincerely regrets that she was not in a right frame of mind to do so. Nash, pictured, qualified as a veterinarian nurse 14 years ago but lost her job after the death of her father . Jacqui Kennedy, director of regulation and enforcement for Birmingham City Council, said: 'This sad case highlights how important it is for people to look after their pets and they owe them a duty of care. 'While many pet owners love their animals and take good care of them, ensuring they are well fed and maintained, there are some who do not understand their responsibility, and unfortunately our dog wardens are seeing more of these kinds of cases. 'This is why it\u2019s so important to highlight what can happen to the owner, as well as their pet, if they are neglected or disowned, and the judge was very clear that Miss Nash will go to prison if she breaks the terms of her sentence.'",

        "article": "Broke, on the dole, a failed last ditch High Court appeal to clear his name, facing lengthy jail sentences for sexual assault and plotting his wife's murder, Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Monday morning a man at the end of the line. Just three days earlier his all consuming desire to clear his name had for all practical reasons come to an end. The 50-year-old, who almost two decades earlier had fled Iran accused of scamming thousands from innocent citizens, faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges. Monis had taken up a number of jobs and aliases since arriving in Australia, where he was known as Michael Hayson, Michael Hassan, Michael Hayson Mavros, Mohammad Hassan Manteghi (his real name), Shiekh Haron and, finally, Man Haron Monis. Scroll down for video . Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court . His 'profession' had ranged from psychic to spiritual healer, and it was in the latter job which he practised at Wentworthville and other western Sydney locations which resulted in sexual asault and indecency charges stretching back to 2001. After six years on unemployment benefits, Monis couldn't even afford the $1000 bail on the charges in April, relying on his girlfriend's mother to pay up. And last Friday morning, just three days before he took a shotgun to Martin Place, Monis was rebuffed yet again. After reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to he families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, Monis had taken his case to the High Court. The 50-year-old faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges . On Monday he took 18 hostages and held many of them in the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney for over 16 hours . He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court. In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional. Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold. Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family . On Tuesday morning many innocent people were injured (pictured) and two were tragically killed in the deadly siege . By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application. Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed. Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family. Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012. In April the mother of Monis' children\u00a0Noleen Hayson Pal\u00a0was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington . But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder. His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder. Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder. Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder . Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act. No date had been set for the murder trial. But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed. Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Last week's tornado outbreak was the largest in U.S. history, according to the National Weather Service. At least 178 tornadoes tore across communities in 14 states and caused 327 deaths. Among the communities affected by the storms was Ringgold, a small town in northwest Georgia. Half of the town's businesses were damaged, and many homes were reduced to rubble. Ringgold, population 2,800, had limited resources to deal with the emergency until 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team rolled into town. With more than $1 million worth of specialized equipment, Agoglia's mobile response team has the tools and the experience to help communities recover in their darkest hours. CNN spoke to Agoglia about his group's recent efforts in Ringgold. CNN: Where were you when you heard about the storms, and why did you decide to come to Ringgold? Tad Agoglia: (We) had been in North Carolina for the past two weeks. We responded to a terrible tornado there that ripped through most of the state. All of a sudden, we're watching on TV one of the worst (tornado outbreaks) form in United States history, possibly. We knew there was going to be a tremendous amount of suffering, and we knew we had to respond. We decided to come to Ringgold, Georgia, because it's a small community, and most likely they didn't have resources they would need to deal with this type of storm. CNN: What kind of resources do you bring with you? Agoglia: When a disaster strikes, you don't really know what you're going to need, so you have to bring everything. That's why we've packaged up four tractor-trailers loaded with just about every type of tool and gear and piece of equipment. We have huge lighting systems and rubble cameras for search and rescue. We've got cranes and trucks to remove the debris from the road. We've got the (generators) to power up emergency rooms, nursing homes, shelters. We've got just about every type of cutting tool known to mankind -- plasmas cutters, concrete saws, metal saws, wood saws -- anything that you need to get through an area to get to the people that need help. We have seen just about every type and size of disaster imaginable. We can create a lot of progress really quickly in a lot of communities just by the experience we have and the equipment we have. CNN: What have you been doing since you arrived in Ringgold? Agoglia: We were able to get the church powered up and utilize it as a shelter. After that, we quickly moved in gear to start clearing roadways. Clearing roads is really important, because people can't get out if the roads aren't cleared. Ambulances and fire trucks need to get to home sites to perform search and rescue, so we help with that. This debris is really tricky stuff to deal with. When you look at a road and it's covered with houses and trees and cars -- just about anything you can imagine -- it's a little challenging to figure out how to clear that path. But we've got the equipment to be able to do that. So we just began to clear one road after the other. CNN: You've also been clearing home sites. How do you decide who to help? Agoglia: It was a little difficult to figure out where to start. It's just home after home, hundreds of them for miles and miles throughout this county and city. And so we decided to start helping families who lost loved ones in the storm. I literally just started walking up the streets. I started asking questions. \"Do you know anybody that's in need? Do you know any families that have lost loved ones?\" And the local community led me to Melba (Weese, whose father was killed). Not only were we able to go through the home site (where Weese's father lived) and find some of their precious belongings and clear the site, but we were also able to prepare the burial grounds for her and her family. CNN: This work is so physically and emotionally grueling. What keeps you going? Agoglia: This is part of being human. A lot of people think the government is supposed to help us or FEMA's supposed to help us, the White House in Washington will help us. But when we see people who are really suffering and struggling, it's our responsibility to come and to help. I'll come into a city, and I'll meet absolute strangers. And within days, they're kind of like friends and family. And it's hard when you look into their faces and you see the sadness and the loss, the shock and confusion. And all I can hope is that what we did makes a difference in their lives ... and hopefully others will also rise to the occasion, see the needs and do something about it.

        "article": "By . Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 11:44 EST, 13 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:01 EST, 14 May 2013 . The past 75 years has seen it all: man walking on the moon, the first female Prime Minister, hemlines rising and falling, recessions, more recessions and plenty of Royal celebrations. But according to nostalgic Brits, nothing can trump the music, fashion and sporting successes of the Sixties as they vote it the best of all the past eight decades. Three quarters of those polled cited the music scene as the reason they would love to have lived in - or are glad they experienced - the Swinging Sixties, while the next biggest group named culture, fashion and sporting events as the reason they rate the Sixties. The Sixties music scene, led by Liverpudlian band The beatles, is the reason why 84% of people voted for the 60\u00bfs as the best decade to live in . The study, which asked Brits to recall their fondest iconic moments and memories from the past eight decades, found that with 40 per cent of the votes, Sixties legends The Beatles are unrivalled when it comes to best British band. Queen and The Rolling Stones are next in line. Even the younger generations quizzed are fans of Sixties music too, with over a quarter of 18-24-year-olds voting for The Beatles over new bands. Top look: The miniskirt, as made famous by Twiggy and Mary Quant was named as one of the\u00a0 nation's fashion favourites of the past 75 years . When it comes to sporting victories, even after a spectacular summer of sport in 2012, almost a third of the nation still hold onto the 1966 Football World Cup win as the greatest sporting moment of the past 75 years. Would you rather be living in the Sixties than today? 1984 Winter Olympic winners Torvill & Dean, perhaps surprisingly, skated into second position, eclipsing other Olympic legends such as Sir Steve Redgrave and our 2012 hero, Bradley Wiggins. And as for fashion favourites, the miniskirt, \u2018Little Black Dress\u2019 and bikini are the nation\u2019s highest rated looks of the past 75 years - although men were six times more likely to vote for the bikini, and twice as likely to vote for the miniskirt than women. The survey, conducted by Nescaf\u00e9 Original to celebrate its 75th anniversary, also found that the Little Black Dress, elevated to iconic status by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany\u2019s, is the undisputed fashion favourite of women, suggesting a true classic will stand the test of time and remain iconic for generations to come.

He'd like to jump out of an airplane and feel that freedom one more time. He'd like to have his family and close friends around him for a quiet celebration. He'd like a good martini with a couple of olives. But most of all, I know he'd like you, on the occasion of his birthday, to give to others. Volunteer service is Dad's true north. He made it a centerpiece of his presidency, encouraging millions of people to look within to find \"your own special genius for helping others.\" He gave 1,020 Daily Point of Light Awards from the White House to inspire people to volunteer and to prove that \"somewhere in America, every serious social problem is being solved through voluntary service, for therein lies the greatest national resource of all.\" In the years since he left the White House, Dad joined forces with former President Bill Clinton to support victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami -- and the volunteers who showed up afterward to help rebuild. Opinion: What George H.W. Bush, at 90, can teach millennials . Last July, he and Mom traveled to the White House to join President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama and hundreds of others in a special ceremony to present the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award to an Iowa couple fighting world hunger one meal at a time. So what would he really like for his birthday? He'd like you to go to BeOne.PointsofLight.org and pledge to pitch in. As Dad said, \"It doesn't matter who you are. Everybody's got something to give: a job skill, a free hour, a pair of strong arms.\" I hope you'll volunteer as a way to honor my Dad -- or yours (Father's Day is Sunday). Or volunteer as a way to be good to yourself; researchers say it leads to healthier, happier lives. Whatever your cause, whatever your motivation, I hope you'll agree with me that volunteer service is an extraordinary gift. Thanks for everything and happy birthday, Dad.",

        "article": "Gesticulating wildly on the witness stand Thursday, a grimacing and sobbing Ana Trujillo told the jurors that she stabbed her boyfriend with a stiletto heel to save her own life. Trujillo, 45, took the witness stand in Houston, Texas for the first time during the two-week trial as part of the punishment phase, which will determine her sentence. She faces the possibility of life in prison. The jury convicted Trujillo Tuesday of murder in last June's killing of 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson at his home. Prosecutors say she pinned him down and stabbed him at least 25 times with the five-and-a-half inch heel of her shoe. Scroll down for video . In her own words: Ana Trujillo testifies during the punishment phase of her trial on Thursday, two days after she was convicted of killing her boyfriend with a shoe . Emotional: Trujillo told the jurors she killed him in a desperate attempt to save her own life during a brutal fight of more than an hour . Narrative: The 45-year-old convicted killer said she was chased down, knocked into a wall and thrown over a couch by the victim . Victimized: During more than five hours of testimony, Trujillo said that she had been repeatedly abused by men . Blood on her hands: Trujillo testified that she did not realize how badly she injured her boyfriend until she looked at her gore-covered hands . Trujillo's attorneys say Andersson attacked her and she defended herself with the only weapon she had available, her shoe. During . more than five hours of rambling testimony by mid-afternoon, Trujillo . said that she had been repeatedly abused by men, including sexual . assault by her first husband. Trujillo told jurors Andersson became enraged and she fought for her life during a fight that lasted more than an hour. She said she tried to calm him down, but Andersson started yelling at her and Trujillo realized she could not talk him down. \u2018I . became frightened. I did fear for my life. I felt he lost it,\u2019 she . said, adding that she started striking him with the shoe anywhere she . could. \u2018Why did you keep on hitting him?\u2019 her attorney Jack Carroll asked. \u2018He wouldn't let go of my leg. The pain wouldn't stop,\u2019 she said. Reenactment: Defense attorney Jack Carroll, left, and Ana Trujillo demonstrate the fight that led to a fatal stabbing . When asked by her attorney, Jack Carroll (pictured), why she kept striking her lover with the shoe, Trujillo replied that he would not let go of her leg . Trujillo said that at first she hit him on his back and on his arms, then on his head as a last resort. \u2018I had no idea I was hurting him that . badly,\u2019 she said. \u2018I reached over and said, \u201cOh God, what happened?\u201d I . reached over and my hands were full of blood.\u2019 She . also told jurors that Andersson was a heavy drinker who refused to eat . and whose mental and physical health began to deteriorate. She said she became afraid of him because at night he would wake up angry, disoriented and start yelling. When . asked by her lawyer, Mr Carroll, why she didn't leave Andersson, . Trujillo said: 'Because I loved him and I wanted him to get better. I . wanted him to stop drinking so much.' Ana Trujillo reacts after being found guilty of killing her boyfriend, after the jury deliberated less than two hours, on Tuesday in Houston, Texas . But during the testimony, Trujillo did not discuss Andersson in great detail. During often meandering testimony, . Trujillo told jurors she had a history of being sexually or physically . abused by men. She said she had been sexually assaulted by her first . husband and told jurors that another boyfriend had kicked her in the . stomach when she was pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. Trujillo was found guilty this week of killing Alf Stefan Andersson with her stiletto shoe . Trujillo described being attacked in an incident reminiscent of Andersson's slaying. She told jurors a friend in 2009 had tried to rape her in his apartment, pinning her down and that she used the only weapon within reach - a candlestick - to fend him off. Trujillo's former friend testified on Wednesday that it was Trujillo who knocked him out with the candlestick in an unprovoked attack. No charges were filed related to that incident. She also discussed her upbringing, including growing up in Arizona after being born in Mexico, and her various jobs, including massage therapist, club bouncer and artist. At times during her verbose testimony, prosecutor John Jordan would ask the judge to instruct Trujillo to not answer her lawyer's questions in the form of narration. Trujillo's attorney has not yet questioned her in detail about the night Andersson died. On Wednesday, prosecutors presented 19 witnesses during the trial's punishment phase. Most of the witnesses detailed Trujillo's criminal history or firsthand experiences in which she became violent toward them when she drank. Trujillo was arrested twice for drunken driving, once in 2008 and again in 2010. A psychologist testifying for the defense told jurors Trujillo had been in a series of violent or abusive relationships, including with Andersson, and she was acting in self-defense on the night of the slaying. Jurors on Wednesday also heard from Anderson's family and friends, who testified that he was a good person who wouldn't hesitate to help anyone and that they were still trying to understand his violent death. Prosecutor John Jordan does a crime scene demonstration, using a dummy, during the trial against Ana Trujillo last week in Houston. She took the stand today to fight against spending the rest of her life in prison .",

        "article": "By . Kieran Gill . Should Roy Hodgson stay on as England manager? Roy Hodgson should not remain in charge of England after their worst World Cup since 1958, say 68 per cent in Sportsmail's online poll. England's two defeats, losing 2-1 to Italy before being beaten by the same scoreline to Uruguay, means the Three Lions won't get out of Group D. Costa Rica's 1-0 win over Italy on Friday was the final nail in England's World Cup coffin, but FA chairman Greg Dyke has assured Hodgson that he will remain in charge. Have your say by voting in our poll - should Roy Hodgson stay on as England manager? Staying? England manager Roy Hodgson should go, according to 68 per cent in Sportsmail's poll . Refuse: Hodgson will not resign and FA chairman Greg Dyke has backed the under-fire England boss . Bad: It has been England's worst World Cup since 1958, having lost their two opening games . Gutted: England players were left on the brink of elimination and it was confirmed when Costa Rica beat Italy . BORN: Croydon, England, August 9 1947 . 1976-1980: Halmstads BK . 1982-1982: Bristol City . 1982-1982: IK Oddevold . 1985-1989: Malmo FF . 1990-1992: Neuchatel Xamax . 1992-1995: Switzerland . 1995-1997: Inter Milan . 1997-1998: Blackburn Rovers . 1999-2000: Grasshoppers . 2000-2001: FC Copenhagen . 2001-2001: Udinese . 2002-2004: United Arab Emirates . 2004-2005: Viking . 2006-2007: Finland . 2007-2010: Fulham . 2010-2011: Liverpool . 2011-2012: West Brom . 2013-NOW: England . HONOURS SINCE 2000: Europa League runner-up (2010), Danish Superliga (2001), Danish Super Cup (2001) When asked whether Hodgson would remain manager until his contract runs out at the end of the 2016 European Championships in France, Dyke said: 'That is the view of myself, of everybody else here (in Brazil) and of others in the FA. 'We're supportive of Roy Hodgson, we've asked him to stay as manager. 'Roy has done a good job and it was always an approach for four years and we hope to do better in the European Championship. 'We do not see any value in changing.' It has struck a nerve with the majority of supporters. One, because they feel Hodgson should be cut loose. Two, because they think Dyke is using upcoming tournaments to deflect from England's current World Cup disappointment. Dyke, who infamously made the cut-throat gesture once England were drawn in Group D, stretched as far as looking towards the 2022 World Cup. 'There is a real chance that we can develop and win in 2022,' he said. 'That is the aim.' Hodgson has also refused to quit his post, and thinks it is not necessary for him to leave after falling at the first hurdle. 'I don't have any intention to resign,' he said. 'I'm bitterly disappointed, of course, but I don't feel I need to resign, no.' The Three Lions face Costa Rica on Tuesday to bring Group D to a close, and can become the first England team in history to lose all three games in a World Cup qualifying group. Sportsmail's poll attracted 6,536 votes - 4,428 said Hodgson should go while 2,108 want him to stay. Carry on: Hodgson's contract runs out at the end of the 2016 European Championships in France . Disaster: Uruguay striker Luis Suarez played a major part in dumping England out, scoring twice . Results: Two in three fans want Hodgson to leave or be sacked, but neither look likely .",

The feud had been simmering between the pair for the past two weeks after current Money In The Bank-title holder Rollins claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show. Stewart then issued a challenge to Rollins via a cell phone clip before the two men briefly came face-to-face on The Daily Show itself last week when Rollins got Stewart in a headlock. Scroll down for videos . Daily Show host Jon Stewart took his life into his hands on Monday night when he entered the wrestling ring to spar with WWE star Seth Rollins as their feud continued . A feud had been simmering between the pair for the past two weeks after current Money In The Bank-title holder Rollins claimed that he could do a better job of hosting the Comedy Central show . Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin . 'Shut your mouth and bring it,' said Rollins and on Monday night in New Jersey that is exactly what Stewart did. On Monday\u2019s Raw the beef between the two stars had continued as Rollins staged his own version for The Daily Show and called Stewart out to face him. Stewart, a big WWE fan, walked out to the sound of his show's theme music and then confronting Rollins, calling him 'a swat team stripper with Lady Gaga\u2019s hair.' Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin. The pair\u2019s beef started two weeks ago when Rollins had proudly boasted that he had aspirations beyond being 'the future of WWE'. 'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd. Then as Rollins was about to hit Stewart for his insolence, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart the opportunity to hit Rollins below the belt in the groin . As Rollins was about to hit Stewart, WrestleMania opponent Randy Orton interrupted proceedings and gave Stewart time to kick Rollins . 'Hell, if I wanted, I could become president. Or I could take over as host of The Daily Show for Jon Stewart and make that thing actually watchable.' Stewart, who announced last month that he is leaving his award-winning show after 16 years, responded to Rollins with a short video message in which he warned the wrestler that he was messing with the wrong guy. 'Seth Rollins, you've made a lot of mistakes in your life: Being a turncoat to the Shield, being a toady for the Authority, not being able to choose which color your hair should be \u2013 but this is the biggest mistake you ever made,' said Stewart. 'You just stepping in a world of hurt, my friend. I'm coming for you Rollins, and you're gonna see it: 160 pounds of dynamite.' Stewart then admitted that 'my bone density is not what it used to be,' and instead declared himself '160 pounds of wood, like a soft wood. My point is you messed with the wrong guy!' 'Right now, I am the most talented performer in the entire world. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want,' Rollins told the crowd.

        "article": "By . Katie Nicholl  and Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 20:43 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:43 EST, 9 November 2013 . When the Duchess of Cambridge was . pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week, it was a marked . contrast with her normally immaculate look. It was also a clue to the trendy colouring technique that attracted attention at Prince George\u2019s christening. Today, The . Mail on Sunday has revealed that she has been having a \u00a3350 colouring . treatment known as balayage \u2013 a technique that involves \u2018painting\u2019 the . hair with ammonia-free dye to give a natural look. Balayage: The Duchess of Cambridge has adopted a new hassle-free beauty regime of ammonia-free hair dye . Blonde disciples: Sienna Miller (left) and Kate Moss (right) are fans of balayage. The French style, which means 'to sweep', was made in the 1970s for blonde hair, which reacts more readily to the hand-painted bleach . It is popular with celebrities including Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. But, . as last week\u2019s pictures make clear, balayage colour can fade quickly on . brunettes \u2013 and Kate has already summoned her hairdresser for a . touch-up. The trend was invented in France in the 1970s - although it didn't take off in Britain until 2008. Translating as 'to sweep', the free-hand strokes of bleach painted onto a woman's hair is designed to give a style of movement that block colour cannot. Chocolate brown: Throughout her life as a student at St Andrews, Kate's hair was a block shade of dark brown . Uniform: The Duchess's hair was immaculately uniform when she announced her engagement . Brunette balayage: Julia Roberts (left) and Sarah Jessica Parker (right) have used it to give their hair shape . It was originally only done for blondes, whose hair is more sensitive to the dye and more readily shows the effects. But as demand soared, stylists worked to develop different techniques which work for brown hair. As pictures of Kate captured this week, brunettes are still resilient to bleach as dark hair takes longer to react. And . balayage, designed for natural hair, is not the ideal way to cover . already existing roots. Kate has been topping up her chocolate brown . locks for years. Impeccably . placed sources have whispered that the Duchess had, to her then horror, . started finding the odd stray grey (\u2018stress highlights\u2019, her friends . joke) before her pregnancy. When the technique crept onto catwalks . five years ago, beauty blogs and fashion magazines lauded it as 'the . working woman's dream'. It is low maintenance, deliberately uneven, and lasts longer. After three appointments, only a toner and freshener is required, rather than the full treatment. Compared . to normal dye, when balayage grows out there is not a clear line of . roots, meaning women can be more flexible with their appointments. To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair And Metrospa in Chelsea. Evidently, Kate has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers, even royal ones, can spare four hours at the salon when they've got a four-month-old to look after. 'Going grey marks nature\u2019s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says Galvin Jr. 'I always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly.' However, Kate may want to avoid any unnecessary chemicals: it could be that she's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant or breastfeeding. Many women stop colouring their hair during pregnancy, with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of their baby to begin again. This is for fear of the chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through breast-feeding.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama invited Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to this year's State of the Union address where he praised the Democrat for aggressively carrying out the Affordable Care Act. \"He is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth's families,\" Obama said about Beshear, who boasts that more than 420,000 people have signed up for his state's version of the controversial federal health law championed by Obama. Although he's with the President on Obamacare, Beshear has turned from Democrats on same-sex marriage, saying he would appeal a federal court ruling overturning the Kentucky ban. Beshear argues that traditional marriage leads to procreation and a stable economy, and he's challenging the decision \"so that the matter is fully before\" the federal appeals court. His position swims against same-sex marriage tide. States continue to legalize it and courts continue to strike down bans where it isn't. It's growing more likely that it will wind up before the Supreme Court, as early as the next term. Even Republican governors, including Pennsylvania's Tom Corbett and New Jersey's Chris Christie, decided to not appeal court decisions striking down similar laws. Beshear's short statement is a continuation of one he issued in March after his attorney general, fellow Democrat Jack Conway, decided not to push the issue. At the time he said he wanted to challenge same-sex proponents to ultimately settle the issue and prevent \"legal chaos.\" In Beshear's effort through the courts to bring \"certainty and finality\" to the issue, he appears to oppose same-sex marriage by challenging the ruling as governor without having to take a personal stance. It's a politically skillful move for a popular Democratic governor in an increasingly Republican state. While Kentucky has a Democratic governor, its two senators are Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul. The state's opinion of national Democrats is low, as Obama received a paltry percentage of the vote - only 38% - in 2012. Stephen Voss, a University of Kentucky political science professor, said Beshear's decision is in accordance with the politics of the state. \"He's acting like a large chunk of the voters,\" Voss said. The state is one of the last bastions of the dying breed of southern Democrats who are socially conservative and fiscally more liberal. The most recent polling in Kentucky on the issue found that 55% of people oppose same-sex marriage, a stark difference compared to the 38% against it nationally. Phillip Bailey, political editor at Kentucky Public Radio's WFPL in Louisville, said the national Democratic Party is far more liberal than the Kentucky Democratic Party. \"The kryptonite for a moderate Democrat with an increasingly liberal party in a conservative state is social issues,\" Bailey said. In an address to the state's General Assembly during his re-election campaign in 2011, Beshear stood before the lawmakers, rose his voice, pointed his finger and told Obama to \"Get off our backs!\" when it comes to coal plant regulations. Bailey said Beshear's politics are masterful. \"I don't think there's anyone else who has been able to yell at the President on TV and then go to Washington and be in the front row of the State of the Union and get praise from the President,\" he said. \"That shows the mastery of Beshear to walk that line.\" Beshear is term-limited and will be out in less than two years. But political roots run deep and his legacy continues after 2015 as his son, Andy Beshear, has announced a run for statewide office. Andy Beshear hopes to succeed Conway, who is running for governor, as attorney general. The younger Beshear is likely to be up against a a conservative Democrat in the primary and even more conservative Republican in the general election. \"He's got to worry about the political viability of the Beshear brand,\" Voss said.

        "article": "By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 05:50 EST, 18 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:52 EST, 18 April 2013 . By her own admission, Ashley-Rae Tapping didn't 'fit in' at school. The 24-year-old told MailOnline she stood . out growing up in Leyton, east London, with her unique sense of style . and home-made headbands. But now the 24-year-old is making waves in the fashion world after setting up her own clothing line, Loud Culture, with friend Abi Fashesin. Fashion entrepreneur: Ashley-Rae Tapping has set up her own clothing line with Abi Fashesin . Fan: Diana Vickers wore a boob tube from the Loud Culture 2011 collection in More magazine . The pair met at college, where Ashley-Rae was studying PR and journalism and Abi was a fashion student, and after launching their spring/summer 2011 then 2012 collections, Loud Culture already has a number of celeb fans. Little Mix have worn items in photo shoots, while Diana Vickers has appeared on magazine covers in their clothes. Another X Factor finalist, Misha B, . has performed in their designs, as have girl band Stooshe. Ashley-Rae said it 'feels great' to . see stars in their designs. 'We didn't think anyone would take notice of . us, so it's a dream come true to see stars like Little Mix in our . clothes. It makes us even more determined.' Ashley-Rae describes their clothing as 'fun and edgy', combining bold African-inspired prints with contemporary tailoring. Exposure: Diana Vickers also wore a leotard from the brand on the magazine cover . 'We're both of African descent so wanted to wear clothing that reflects that,' she said. 'However, a lot of the clothing in African print is very baggy, and we wanted something more fitting and fun. After we left college, we both knew we wanted to work in fashion, so we thought why not set up our own clothing line?' The pair combined their savings, meaning they had \u00a35,000 to get their business off ground. Ashley-Rae, whose mother is a seamstress and father a businessman, explained: 'I come from a hard-working family and my parents always taught me to work hard if I wanted to get what I wanted. 'While I was a student I juggled two or three jobs - at hairdressers, call centres and clothes shops - I saved as much as I could because I always dreamed of one day being my own boss. 'As we didn't have much money to start with, we got our friends and family involved as much as possible, web designers we knew offered to do our website for free, and friends modelled the clothes.' They now sell their creations through their online store at competitive high street prices, and last year made \u00a310,000. Got the X factor: Ashley-Rae said it feels great to see stars in their clothes, like Little Mix's Leigh Anne, pictured second from right, in a Loud Culture top . Loud Culture's success so far has been down to Ashley-Rae and Abi's dedication to getting themselves noticed - largely by using social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter. They contacted fashion bloggers, celebrity stylists, photographers and models to get their clothing on the fashion radar. Ashley-Rae said: 'It was all about being persistent and knocking on as many doors as we could. We believed in our brand and although we had nothing but knock-backs to begin with, we've now proved that passion and persistence do pay off.' Their enterprising efforts were also noticed by Richard Branson, and they are now members of his Virgin Media Pioneers, an initiative he set up to support young entrepreneurs. Ashley-Rae said the initiative offers them support and motivation to believe 'anything is possible'. Fun and edgy designs: Girl band Stooshe pictured performing in outfits from the 2012 collection . The enterprising designer has had further successes as a celebrity fashion guru, as through contacts she has made through Loud Culture she has now become a stylist to pop star Chipmunk. On top of this role she and Abi are continuing to expand Loud Culture, adding new lines to their collection and continuing to think big. 'We would love one day to see Rihanna or Beyonce in our clothes,' Ashley-Rae said. Virgin Media Pioneers is an online community which aims to celebrate, support and nurture young ambitious minds who have the skill, ambition and drive to achieve their goals.

        "article": "By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 04:15 EST, 15 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:49 EST, 15 August 2012 . The shocking hours worked by engineers at Samsung while creating its mobile phones has been revealed. An engineer who helped develop the Galaxy S phone admitted to only sleeping for 2-3 hours a night while working on the handset. The revelations came as the Korean firm's court battle with Apple intensified. Samsung's Galaxy S handset. Engineers today admitted they only slept for two hours a night while developing it . A Samsung Electronics Co Ltd expert witness testified on Tuesday that Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad violate three of Samsung's patents, as the South Korean electronics company went on offense in the third week of a high stakes trial. Dr. Woodward Yang, an electrical engineering professor at Harvard, said Apple's products use Samsung-patented features for mobile devices, including the process for seamlessly emailing photos. He was one of Samsung's first witnesses after a parade of Apple experts said Samsung phones and tablets violated Apple's patents. Additionally, one of Samsung's designers testified that she did not rely on Apple designs to create icons for Samsung's Galaxy S smartphone line. Apple and Samsung are going toe-to-toe in a patents dispute mirroring a struggle for industry supremacy between two rivals that control more than half of worldwide smartphone sales. The U.S. company accuses Samsung of copying the design and some features of its iPad and iPhone, and is asking for a sales ban in addition to monetary damages. The Korean company, which is trying to expand in the United States, says Apple infringed several patents, including some for its key wireless technology. Apple concluded presenting evidence regarding its own patents this week, and Samsung started calling witnesses. On Tuesday, Yang said Samsung's patents were filed before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Yang focused on patents that cover smartphone features, not wireless technology. One of those patents covers technology for easily finding photos in an album. 'The idea here was, let's have a bookmark,' Yang said. Under questioning from Apple attorney Bill Lee, Yang acknowledged he had not seen evidence that Samsung actually used any of those features in its own smartphones. Later on Tuesday, Samsung called designer Jeeyuen Wang, who said she and a large Korean team worked hard for three months to create Samsung's own icon designs for Galaxy S phones. 'I slept perhaps two hours, or three hours a night,' Wang said. Apple's iPhone: The legal battle with Samsung centres around several patents relating to smartphones and mobile communications . Apple attorney Michael Jacobs showed Wang internal Samsung documents - with her name on them - containing references to Apple icons. However, under questioning from Samsung attorney John Quinn, Wang said some of those documents were created well after Samsung had finished its own designs. In an attempt to invalidate some of Apple's patents in the case, Samsung also presented evidence this week to show that Apple's patents cover technological advances - like multitouch - that had already been developed before Apple claims to have invented it.",

        "article": "A dormant volcano buried two miles (3.2 km) beneath Stoke-on-Trent could supply heat to homes in the UK city by 2019. There is a layer of hot rocks at this depth that heats water to more than 105\u00b0C (220\u00b0F). And the City Council has announced it is planning to invest \u00a352m ($85m) in a geothermal district heating network (DHN) to bring this heated water to the surface. It could then be used to supply nearby homes and buildings with cheaper fuel. Houses in Stoke-on-Trent could be heated by geothermal energy by 2019. A dormant volcano 350-million-years-old is believed to be heating rocks and water to more than 105\u00b0C (220\u00b0F) underground. This heated water would be brought to the surface by a geothermal district heating network (DHN). Pictured is a DHN in Paris . According to the Stoke Sentinel,\u00a0work on the DHN will begin in 2016 and is expected to be completed by March 2019. District heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another. In the case of geothermal district heating, this involves bringing heated water up from underground. Beneath Earth\u2019s crust, geothermal energy is stored in the form of heat. This can heat subsurface rocks and, in turn, heat water stored in underground reservoirs - or aquifers. Bringing this water to the surface can provide a sustainable source of heat for homes, as the water underground is replenished. Geothermal energy can be used not only to provide heat, but also to provide electricity in the form of geothermal power generation. While the UK does not have the resource potential of volcanic regions like New Zealand and Iceland for such power generation, it has enough geothermal energy underground to make heat-only projects a viable option. A network of pipes would take supply homes in Hanley, Stoke and Festival Park with heated water from this sleeping volcano. The scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so-called 'fuel poverty' - a term used to describe households that can't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm - save 11,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year, and safeguard 1,300 jobs. While geothermal DHN\u2019s are fairly common in Europe, this would be only the UK\u2019s second such system. The first was built in Southampton in 2012. The heat would be pumped to buildings through seven miles (11km) of pipes, providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available. Each home would have a pair of pipes connected to the network, which would eliminate the need for a conventional boiler in the home. The pipes will be under the council\u2019s control, but the private sector will be tasked to construct and maintain the \u00a317m ($28m) geothermal well. The hot water comes from heated rocks that are linked to a 350 million-year-old volcano in North Staffordshire. District heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another. In the case of geothermal district heating, this involves bringing heated water up from underground where it is heated by rocks. This water can be pumped down before being returned to the surface . While no one is entirely sure why the rocks are heated, its believed this dormant volcano is the cause. \u2018With deep geothermal, you need a particular kind of geology, with rocks that are at a higher temperature than normal,\u2019 Professor Peter Styles from Keele University told the Sentinel. \u2018But as you need to be able to extract the heat through water, you also need permeable rocks.\u2019 He added: \u2018It\u2019s a bit like having a hot water bottle in the ground.\u2019 A network of pipes would take supply homes in Hanley, Stoke and Festival Park (shown) with heated water from this sleeping volcano. The scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so-called 'fuel poverty' - a term used to describe households that can't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm . While geothermal DHN\u2019s are fairly common in Europe this would be only the UK\u2019s second such system, with the first in Southampton. The heat would be pumped to bildings through seven miles (11km) of pipes (comparable network shown in Iceland), providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- \"Death rays\" sound more like a sci-fi creation than a pool-side concern, but guests soaking up the sun at the Vdara Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, might want to take cover. According to a report in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the reflective hotel's south-facing tower can bounce rays that will melt plastic and singe hair at certain times of the day and year. Visiting lawyer Bill Pintas from Chicago, Illinois, had a scorching encounter and said hotel pool employees told him they call it \"the death ray,\" according to the report. Pintas, who co-owns a Vdara condo, told the Review-Journal his hair was singed as he was reclining on the pool deck around noon on a mid-September day. \"I was effectively being cooked,\" Pintas said. \"I started running as fast as I could without looking like a lunatic.\" The rays also melted the thin plastic bag around his newspaper, Pintas said. Hotel designers were aware of potential solar \"convergence\" and applied a film that reduced the problem by about 70 percent before the Vdara opened in December 2009, according to MGM Resorts spokesman Alan Feldman. \"What remains are seasonal hot spots that are most acute of course in the summertime,\" Feldman said. Historic high temperatures in Las Vegas this summer have intensified the problem. Hotel staffers are aware of the hot spots and move guests around the pool deck when necessary, Feldman said. Planners are also looking at additional shading options or putting planters where the rays get particularly hot, he said. The hotel hasn't received any complaints of injury beyond those reported by Pintas. \"Death ray\" media coverage in recent weeks hasn't had any effect on bookings, Feldman said, and a 72-hour rate sale under way now is unrelated to the buzz. \"I suppose there might even be folks who are very passionate about the sun who want to come see it,\" Feldman said. \"It isn't a visible thing ... if you were standing in the middle of it when it's 110 [degrees], you're going to feel it. We happen to be in a much cooler week this week so right now, today, it might actually feel good,\" he said, laughing.",

        "article": "(LifeWire)  -- Charlotte Eulette of Montclair, New Jersey, ceremoniously reclaimed her maiden name and slipped a ring from her mother on her newly bare wedding ring finger. Charlotte Eulette donned a shiny cocktail dress for her divorce celebration to reflect her goal to \"shine on.\" Cathryn Michon hit the Los Angeles restaurant Mr. Chow with some friends who'd brought divorce gifts. In Las Vegas, reality-show regular Shanna Moakler served a three-tiered gateau -- complete with knife-wielding-bride cake topper (and matching dead groom) -- to attendees after her (first) split from Travis Barker. If just discussing divorce in public seemed taboo a few years ago, the growing trend of divorce celebrations is helping lessen the stigma surrounding the end of marriage. \"Yes, it's sad and it's painful, but it's not failure,\" says Christine Gallagher, the owner of Los Angeles event company The Divorce Party Planner and the author of a book by the same name. \"It's part of life, and yet it's the only major event for which we have no ritual. \"A celebration communicates that divorce is OK -- life-affirming, even.\" Michon, 38, agrees. \"It's like an Irish wake. Just because there's been a death doesn't mean you can't have food and drink, acknowledge the past and hope good things for the future. It's about closure.\" Bearing witness, wedding-style . \"At a wedding, you gather friends and family around and say, 'Support us on this journey,'\" says Eulette, 49, whose 2003 post-split bash was attended by the same klatch of far-flung friends and relatives as her wedding. \"A divorce ceremony is a way to gather them around and say, 'I'm moving on. Please support me.'\" And that support, says Michon, is also practical in nature. \"If you split up, someone's getting the blender and someone's not,\" she says. \"My own celebration was a way for my friends to say, 'We love you no matter what, and by the way, here are a few appliances you're missing.' \"Believe me, a toaster means a lot more when your heart's broken than on your wedding day,\" says Michon, a writer, who recently organized a divorce registry at Target for another friend. \"Especially if you're out thousands of dollars in legal fees.\" Divorce parties: One size doesn't fit all . Just as no two weddings are alike, divorcees are seeking out (or creating from scratch) marriage-ending markers that resonate with them. In Britain, the Great Northern Firework Company offers a divorce-package fireworks display. Godammo.com will melt and mold your wedding ring into a (gunpowder-free) bullet, and WeddingRingCoffin.com sells just that: a practical, dignified way to bury your dead marriage's hardware. \"Burning is big,\" says Gallagher, who's seen everything from wedding dresses to a husband's trophy deer head go up in flames at divorce celebrations organized by her event-planning outfit. The parties -- two or three per month -- serve up signature cocktails with names like the So Long and the Sucker, split-themed soundtracks (\"Hit the Road, Jack\" and \"I Will Survive\" are popular) and dartboards adorned with the ex's face. \"A divorce party makes more sense than a bachelor party,\" says Marc Tadros of Montreal V.I.P., whose luxury divorce getaways have drawn customers, about 20 percent of them female, from as far away as Ireland and Germany. \"It's a good time to blow off steam, work on your social networking skills.\" Focusing on the future . \"Having six or 10 martinis may work for some people, but mine wasn't an ex-bashing ceremony,\" says Joann Lane, 50, a wedding officiant whose party took place five years after the divorce and was attended by the couple's four sons, along with her current and former boyfriends. \"I wanted to acknowledge the good that came out of the marriage, and let go of the anguish.\" In that spirit, Eulette's foundation (and her full-time job) Celebrants USA, which is devoted to celebrating life's milestones, organizes 10 to 15 divorce events each year to help people craft rituals that have meaning for them. One of Eulette's clients celebrated his divorce by gluing back together a broken glass, in a reversal of the Jewish tradition of smashing a glass at the end of the wedding ceremony. \"It's not a hullabaloo; it's about healing and transition,\" Eulette says. \"And everyone has their own story in a divorce --  there's no blueprint for moving forward like there is with marriage.\" Ottawa wellness counselor Lucy MacDonald cautions divorc\u00e9es to consider their motives in hosting a celebration, and not to overlook the key to emotional recovery after divorce: forgiveness, of oneself and one's ex. \"If you're feeling bitter, angry or antagonistic, a divorce party may bring out the worst in you,\" warns MacDonald. \"But if you've accepted your divorce as the next step in your growth as a person, your party is a signal to everyone that you're OK and looking to the future.\" E-mail to a friend .

Final: Germany vs Argentina . Venue: Estadio do Maracana, Rio De Janeiro . Kick-off: 8pm (4pm, Brazil time) TV coverage: BBC1 and ITV1, from 7pm . Odds: Germany 13/10 Draw 11/5 Argentina 12/5 . Referee: Nicola Rizzoli, Italy . Managers: . Joachim Low (Germany)Alejandro Sabella (Argentina) Team talk: Germany head coach Joachim Low talks to his players ahead of the World Cup final . Team news: Germany defender Mats Hummels is expected to be available for selection despite missing the second half against Brazil as a precaution because of tendonitis. Argentina winger Angel Di Maria is a doubt after pulling out of training on Saturday with a suspected thigh injury. Striker Sergio Aguero has fully recovered from a muscle strain and could replace Ezequiel Lavezzi or Gonzalo Higuain. Left-back Marcos Rojo did not complete training on Friday due to a sore ankle but he should be fine for the final. Key clash: Toni Kroos (Germany) v Javier Mascherano (Argentina) Two Golden Ball nominees come face-to-face here and Mascherano must ensure Kroos cannot keep Germany ticking. This game could be decided by just one goal with La Albiceleste\u2019s talisman Lionel Messi unlikely to get much space - so Argentina\u2019s defence, which has not conceded since the group stage, will be vital. VIDEO Team Profile: Germany highlights . Key battle: Golden Ball nominees Toni Kroos (left) and Javier Mascherano come face-to-face on Sunday . One to watch: Manuel Neuer (Germany) The giant Bayern Munich \u2018keeper has been in fine form so far at the World Cup and another good performance will likely win him the Golden Gloves award. Head-to-head record: Played 6 Argentina Wins 4 Draws 2 Losses 0 . Gather round: Argentina players listen to coach Alejandro Saballa (white cap) during training in Rio de Janeiro . Opta stats: . They have won just one of their last four appearances in the World Cup final (1990 v Argentina). Record breaker: Germany's Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history . Star man: Argentina's Lionel Messi (centre) controls the ball as he prepares for the World Cup final . The last time Germany scored in a World Cup match and lost was the 1994 quarter final defeat to Bulgaria (1-2). Germany are unbeaten in 17 internationals (W12, D5). Argentina haven't been trailing in any of their six games at the 2014 World Cup, Germany just eight minutes (v Ghana). Argentina have won four out of five penalty shootouts at the World Cup, Germany won four out of four (including the one against Argentina in 2006). Miroslav Klose has scored more World Cup goals than any other player in history and as many as the entire current Argentinian squad (16). Only Lothar Matth\u00e4us (25) has played more World Cup games than Klose (23, as many as Paolo Maldini). Klose is the only player in both squads who has already played in a World Cup final (2002, 0-2 v Brazil). Argentina's Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo lead the way in terms of crosses attempted from open play, with Rojo's haul of 25 so far bettered only by team-mate di Maria (32). Thomas M\u00fcller has played a hand in 16 World Cup goals in 12 appearances at the finals (10 goals and six assists). M\u00fcller (2010 and 2014) and Klose (2002 and 2006) are the only players in history to score 5+ goals at consecutive World Cup tournaments. Eye on the ball: Germany's Thomas Muller trains at Estadio Vasco da Gama on Saturday . M\u00fcller is the first-ever Golden Boot winner to reproduce his number of goals at the following World Cup (five goals in 2010, five in 2014). M\u00fcller could also become the first player ever to win the Golden Boot at successive World Cups. Lionel Messi has been the most creative player at World Cup 2014, setting up a tournament-high 21 goal-scoring chances for team-mates. Messi has embarked on a tournament-high 65 dribbles so far, completing (another-high) 39 of them. No German player has created more chances for their teammates in the 2014 World Cup than Mesut \u00d6zil (15). Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano has attempted a competition-high 509 passes so far. Mascherano has also made the most tackles so far - 28. Andre Sch\u00fcrrle has scored three times in just 156 minutes of action so far at this World Cup. Only Tim Howard (27) has made more saves in the competition than Manuel Neuer (23). Lionel Messi has scored five World Cup goals to date, but none of them in the knockout stages. Angel di Maria or Sami Khedira will become the 10th player to win both the Champions League and the World Cup in the same season. Seven of the previous nine have been German (Bayern Munich 1974) along with Christian Karembeu in 1998 and Roberto Carlos in 2002. VIDEO Team Profile: Argentina highlights .",

        "article": "A Los Angeles man has survived an apparent suicide attempt at a gas station after setting himself on fire on Wednesday night. Investigators say the driver - who has not been named or aged - was filling up at the Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm. The man allegedly took the gas hose to his SUV, sat inside, sprayed fuel over himself and set himself alight. The car quickly went up in flames, prompting a quick-thinking attendant inside to flip an emergency switch that cut the gas lines, according to NBC San Diego. Flamer: A man has somehow survived setting himself on fire in apparent suicide attempt in San Diego . Fire: Footage of the dramatic incident in Kearny Mesa was taken by a passer-by . Help: The footage shows one man (left) running over to the car with a bucket to try and put out the fire . Extinguish: The man throws the water on the SUV but it does not put out the flames . Close call: The car at the gas pump next to the one on fire only narrowly missed going up in flames too . The move, according to authorities, prevented a potential explosion. Witnesses at the next pump said the man fled the car once he caught fire. Covered in flames, he ran away from the pump, jumped to the floor and did the drop-and-roll technique. He suffered burns to 50 percent of his body. However he somehow survived and is now recovering in hospital. Cell phone video from witnesses showed fire shooting from the vehicle. Burn out: Investigators examine the wreck of the car following the incident . Shut down: The gas station had to be closed for several hours following the fire . Scene: The fire occurred at the\u00a0Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm Wednesday . One bystander can be seen running over with a bucket and throwing water on the car. Firefighters extinguished the flames, and paramedics rushed the patient to the UCSD Burn Center. The incident is still being investigated, with police reviewing video footage from the gas station. If it turns out to be a suicide attempt - which they are suspecting - the man could face numerous arson charges.",

Police in India are hunting a man-eating tiger that is believed to have killed four villagers in 12 days\u00a0 after escaping from an animal reserve. The latest victim was a 40-year-old woman who was attacked on Wednesday in a village in the Moradabad district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. It is believed to have strayed from the nearby Jim Corbett National Park which covers an area of over 200 square miles and is is home to an estimated 200 tigers. Man-eater: Police in India are hunting a tiger which is believed to have killed four people (file picture) Forest officials have recruited two elephants in their efforts to track down the tiger which they hope to drive back towards the national park. A state government spokesman said: 'We have identified four bodies that were killed by the tiger as they bore teeth and claw marks. 'We have launched a thorough search and hope it will go back to its natural habitat.' Angry villagers have accused authorities of not acting quickly enough to capture the animal after the first death was reported at the end of last month. Moves are underway to have the animal categorised as a 'man-eater' meaning it can be legally killed. India is home to some 1,700 tigers - half of the world's rapidly shrinking wild tiger population - but has been struggling to halt the big cat's decline in the face of poachers, international smuggling networks and loss of habitat. The country has seen its tiger population plummet from an estimated 40 000 upon independence in 1947.",

        "article": "Most of us are all too familiar with the rage that ensues when fiddly plastic tags defy all attempts to remove them. But Marks and Spencer has come up with a solution in the shape of a new set of easy-open ties - that will be launched just in time for Christmas. The brainchild of the team at Design Futures, which is based at Sheffield Hallam University, PaperTies are made from recyclable paper and lock the product in place. Impossible: Many of us will be all too familiar with the challenges involved in prising toys from their boxes . Like the traditional plastic variety, they keep toys secured in their box but can be torn away with ease - finally eliminating packaging rage. The new design is part of the British high street brand's bid to boost its eco credentials, with the company hoping to become the world's most sustainable major retailer by 2020. As a result of innovations already in place, the company has already reduced by two billion the number of plastic bags it uses and sends zero waste to landfill. M&S has also become the first retailer to receive the triple award of certification for achievements in carbon, water and waste reduction from the Carbon Trust. But while the company's green plans are good news for the environment, for customers, getting rid of irritating plastic ties is set to prove the icing on the cake. The ties, which use a stronger, more flexible version of regular paper, have already been rolled out in the toy department, and will later be used across several product ranges. New and improved: M&S toys such as this Butterfly Rattle are now held in place with easy-open paper ties . Ever hopeful: With Christmas on the way, M&S hope the new packaging will come in handy for parents . Speaking about the new look packaging, Alex Hill, Senior Packaging Technologist, General Merchandise, at M&S said: 'Getting toys out of their packaging can be a big frustration for consumers and we have been working really hard over the last 18 months to find a solution. 'The PaperTies are designed to be as effective as plastic or metal ties, but can be torn easily - no more accidents trying to cut plastic and wire ties on Christmas Day, and no more frustrated children waiting to play with their new toy.' 'Our design team devised the initial concept for the ties as a direct response to the frustration caused by hard to open toy packaging,' added John Kirkby, creative director at Design Futures. 'We identified a new paper material that is very strong and used it to create a user focused way of holding products in packs. 'Not only is the product much easier to open but the material is better for the environment. It is very exciting to see the team at M&S develop our initial idea and take it to market.'",

        "article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Layoffs for sea lions? Furloughs for frogs? Is there no job security, anywhere? State budget cuts mean New York's 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums will lose $9.1 million in funding. The recession may be coming to a zoo near you. State budget cuts mean many zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose crucial state funding for their exhibits. New York's 76 zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens will lose $9.1 million in state funds next year. \"We're faced with this very difficult problem of firing the animals, as it were,\" said Steve Sanderson, the CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium. They will lose $3 million to budget cuts. The Bronx Zoo has made a short video posted on its Web site www.bronxzoo.com/ to draw attention to the cuts. In the video, the zoo director fires a porcupine and a frog. \"I am sure you have heard that Gov. [David] Paterson's proposed budget will mean severe cuts here at the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium,\" the zoo director says. \"Next year, all 76 zoos, botanical gardens and aquariums in the state will lose all of their state funding. There is no easy way to say this: Even though you bring record numbers of people to New York and help the economy, we are going to have to let you go.\" Firing a porcupine and a frog may be a cute way to get publicity for their budget woes, but it's a serious matter and zoo officials say the recession will certainly affect the animals. Zoo officials say some collections with \"short life cycles\" will not be replaced when they die, and other animals could be sent to other zoos or wildlife sanctuaries. The state of New York funds just 2.7 percent of the Bronx Zoo and the New York Aquarium's budget, but zoo officials say it will be difficult to make up. Between the state budget cuts, the loss in the value of their endowment and fewer people renewing memberships -- times are so tough for the zoo and aquarium -- they say they may lay off 120 to 130 people. \"Two-thirds of our budget is people, and so two-thirds of the cuts will come in cutting positions,\" Sanderson said. \"And we'll also cut back what we provide in the way of education and entertainment and nature experiences for people. So it affects everything.\" Zoo officials questioned the state's priorities. But just about everybody getting taxpayer funds has to cut back. Jeffrey Gordon, a spokesman for the New York State Budget Office told CNN the cuts are regrettable but necessary considering the state's current financial crisis. Citing a \"dramatic reduction in revenue,\" Gordon said, \"Every entity that receives state funds must do what the state has done, which is to review its operations and identify ways to operate at lower costs.\" The Bronx Zoo isn't the only one affected; cutbacks are happening everywhere. The Los Angeles Zoo in California stopped work on its $42 million elephant exhibit last year, and there are big budget cuts for zoos in Maryland, Missouri and North Carolina. There's no relief for the zoos in the $819 billion economic stimulus package. Section 1109 of the stimulus bill which passed this week in the House forbids the use of federal taxpayer money to plug the budget gaps. Taxpayer watchdog groups lobbied to keep zoos, aquariums, swimming pools, golf courses and casinos out of the stimulus, arguing that there are higher priorities for Americans' money during a recession.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Thailand's warring political factions hardly need red shirts and yellow shirts to identify themselves: a short few hours by road from Bangkok reveals a dramatic shift in culture. In central Bangkok, the young and moneyed throng the bars of Thong Lo where the men have the well-groomed detachment of the younger Abhisit -- the Eton and Oxford-educated leader of the opposition, whose 2008-2011 government launched a violent crackdown on the largely rural pro-Thaksin Shinawatra red-shirt protesters in 2010. Amid the jazz bars and cool beer gardens of Thong Lo, these young Thais represent not only an urban and educated middle class but also the money of some of Thailand's most established families. Just a few hours to the northeast and the prevailing culture gives way to pick-up trucks, cowboy hats and the whine of electric organ and guitar that comes from \"mor lam\" music: the Thai \"up country\" version of country and western. Even the King of Thailand, whose image beams from billboards dotted along the highway, is shown in his up country guise wearing the ubiquitous slouch hat favored by Thai farmers. Traditionally the poorest region of Thailand, Isan, in the northeast of the country, accounts for a third of Thailand's population. However, it is rapidly turning from its economic staple of subsistence farming to an economy driven by trade and services. Booming economy . If growth in Thailand -- South East Asia's second largest economy after Indonesia -- is slowing, in the northeast of the country it's booming. Economic growth in the region hit 40% from 2007 to 2011, compared with 23% for the rest of Thailand over that period and just 17% for greater Bangkok, according to government figures. Isan, which once exported people to Bangkok and the rest of the world as cheap migrant labor, is seeing its workers return. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- the sister of deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- has brought in a raft of policies that ensure Thaksin's populist policies, which included practically free healthcare and low-interest loans, continue to underpin the boom in the red shirt heartland. Chief among them is a 2.2 trillion baht (US$71 billion) infrastructure program aimed at the northeast and a nationwide minimum wage of 300 baht (US$10) a day. In some parts of Isan, this boosted household incomes by more than 35%. An expensive rice subsidy, which guarantees farmers 40% above market price for their crops, that has led to a conservative estimate of losses in the region of 136 billion baht ($4.3 billion), has been widely criticized in Thailand and even recently drew fire from the International Monetary Fund, which urged Thailand to drop the $21 billion scheme. Sleeping giant . As the boom fuels a growing middle class, Bangkok's elite now realizes that it ignores the northeast -- which holds a third of the electorate -- at its peril. Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, said that while Thaksin's populism has been demonized in Bangkok, it has awoken a sleeping giant in the northeast. \"There's this cultural overlay,\" Quaglia told CNN. \"Thailand's system has been fairly feudal with the social ascendancy of a small group of historic families in Bangkok lording it over the rest of the country. \"There's an attitude that says 'it's not so wrong to have smart and good people in Bangkok running the entire country'. They don't really want to see one man, one vote. \"It sort of echoes U.S. history when women and blacks fought to get their vote. The underlying supposition is that these people aren't smart enough to really cast an intelligent vote, they're prone to corruption, you can buy their vote for $5.\" Social revolution . He said the advent of social media had also changed the political landscape in Thailand, giving both sides of the political divide a means of organizing quickly and challenging government. \"In Bangkok, we saw the so-called 'V for Thailand' movement where thousands of people changed their Facebook pages,\" Quaglia said, referring to anti-Shinawatra protests in June. \"But also in the northeast, there's a robust social media exchange among people.\" According to Thitinan Pongsudhirak, Professor of Political Science at Chulalongkorn University, the political and socio-economic divide in Thailand is further complicated by the position of the Thai monarchy. \"In Thailand, we are seeing the rise of a citizenry that used to be merely loyal subjects,\" Pongsudhirak told CNN. \"This means that in Thailand almost all Thais are monarchists and democrats at the same time. Most Thais will not reject democracy and they want to protect the monarchy -- they embrace both.\" However, he said that divisions have emerged in this widely held position. \"Some people will embrace electoral democracy first and foremost; these are the people that keep voting for the Thaksin party because they feel that it gives them a voice, it gives them rights, it allows their grievances to be expressed and everything else is subservient to that. \"On the other side you have the anti-government protesters. They don't reject the electoral democracy but they prefer the monarchy-based social and political hierarchy at the top. That's why they keep calling for good people to run a good government to eradicate corruption.\" He said that the monarchy will be critical to the stable future of Thailand. \"The monarchy has become the fault line of Thailand's entrenched polarization and its future, including the succession, is where the battle lines will be drawn.\" CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.",

Tiger Woods fell to the ground in extreme pain Sunday on the 13th hole of the The Barclays due to \u2018sleeping in hotels,\u2019 ruining his chances at a win. It was the final round at Liberty National course in New Jersey and Woods had nearly fought his way into the lead when a severe back spasm left him reeling. The disastrous swing, which put his ball in a water hazard, caused Woods to bogey the hole and eventually fall shot short of the lead. Scroll down for video... Grounded: Tiger Woods was within striking distance of the lead during the final round of The Barclays on Sunday when a crippling back spasm brought him to his knees . For a moment after taking the wild shot, onlookers and announcers suspected Woods wouldn\u2019t even make it through the rest of the tournament. \u2018When it goes into a spasm that bad,\u2019 said one announcer, who moaned in sympathy right along with Woods, \u2018there\u2019s no way to recuperate.\u2019 Woods remained on his knees, clutching his five wood for support, for several moments before finally rising back to his feet. \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen a guy go down from back spasms on a golf swing in a long time,\u2019 the announcer said. For more videos, please got to PGATOUR . Tense: Footage clearly shows Woods' back go rigid after his second swing on the 13th hole at Liberty National . Write caption here . But Woods fought through the pain long enough to trudge off the fairway to the supportive applause of nearby spectators before finally finishing the hole. On Wednesday, Woods first reported his continuing back problem and blamed his overly soft bed. \u2018It was stiff this morning after a soft bed,\u2019 he told reporters. \u2018Just one of those things, sleeping in hotels and I didn't want to push it, so just took it easy.\u2019 Swamped: Woods' ball veered 40 or 50 feet from the green and into a swampy water hazard . Seething: Woods spent several moments on the ground attempting to recuperate . In the round: Cameras caught the fall from several angles . Tough: Eventually, Woods began to right himself with the help of his five wood . On the final day of The Barclays, it looked as if he didn\u2019t take it easy enough. Nonetheless, he would go on to birdie on holes 16 and 17 and come within an inch of a birdie putt on 18. Woods said he had little time to anticipate the injury. \u2018I felt great until that tee shot at 12,\u2019 Woods told ESPN. \u2018I was perfectly fine.\u2019 Painful: He continued to grimace as he slowly stood . Stuck it out: After slinking off the field to the applause of spectators, Woods managed to eke out a near win despite the stunning tumble .",

It can be a dangerous sport at the best of times, so spare a thought for these professional climbers who posed completely naked in a variety of perilous positions for a calendar photoshoot. These striking images show the women posing without any equipment in some of the most sensational landscapes across the United States and the world. Adventure photographer Dean Fidelman, from San Fernando Valley, California, travelled to Colorado, Spain, Argentina, Thailand and other exotic locations to complete the 'Stone Nudes' calendar. Perilous: This woman expertly clings on to a rock completely naked with no climbing equipment. The professional climber was posing for a calendar, Stone Nudes, put together annually by Dean Fidelman . The climbers posed for the photographs in areas from California, United States, to Spain and Argentina . Mr Fidelman would get the women to climb clothed to begin with to work out the best pose positions . In one image, a climber appears to be hanging perilously from a large rock in the desert, while in another a woman carefully makes her way up an almost totally flat boulder surface. \u2018Each year I shoot new pictures and specifically go after these trips. I start around February and work until end of June to make the calendar,\u2019 he said. \u2018All of the girls are professional climbers - mostly I use two degrees of separation on everything. \u2018I know a lot of guy climbers who know girls who are happy to climb naked so they put me in touch with the right people.\u2019 This woman shows her strength by clinging on to a rock while wearing no climbing equipment . The series of images were taken throughout 2013 by adventure photographer Mr Fidelman . Mr Fidelman works on the calendar between February and June to complete it for the new year . Mr Fidelman explained that usually the women will climb the rocks clothed before the photographs are taken so he can work out the best positions for them to pose in. He added: \u2018I have always worked in black and white - it has always been my medium... \u2018Working in black and white sticks with the fine art medium I work in.\u2019 The 12 nude photographs in Mr Fidelman's calendar always appear in black and white . 'All of the girls are professional climbers - mostly I use two degrees of separation on everything,' Mr Fidelman said. 'I know a lot of guy climbers who know girls who are happy to climb naked so they put me in touch'",

Hamilton has been disqualified from the Australian GP after presenting \"misleading\" evidence to stewards. The McLaren driver and Toyota's Jarno Trulli were called to an FIA hearing in Malaysia -- the site of this weekend's grand prix -- on Thursday to discuss an incident during Sunday's race. Trulli finished third at Melbourne's Albert Park, only to later be handed a 25-second penalty by race stewards which relegated him to 12th position and saw Hamilton lifted into third. However, following Thursday's hearing, Trulli has been reinstated in third position. McLaren had complained that veteran Italian Trulli had illegally passed Hamilton under yellow flags following an accident late on involving Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica in his BMW Sauber -- who were running second and third at the time. Trulli had decided not to appeal the original decision but the FIA, the sport's governing body, said it had received new information and pressed ahead with a second hearing. \"The stewards, having considered the new elements presented to them from the 2009 Australian Grand Prix, consider that Lewis Hamilton, and the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team, acted in a manner prejudicial to the conduct of the event by providing evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards at the hearing on Sunday 29th March 2009,\" the FIA said in a statement. It said Hamilton and McLaren had violated its rules and retrospectively disqualified him from the race. Meanwhile, Trulli believes justice has been served after Thursday's decision. \"I am happy because I wanted some justice and I got it,\" he told PA Sport. \"I am happy for myself and the team and I have to thank the FIA because it does not happen very often they reconsider something. \"It must have been really hard for them, but they had common sense to really try and understand what was going on. I have always been honest and it has paid off.\"",

        "article": "By . Kimberley Dadds, Simon Cable and Emily Sheridan . PUBLISHED: . 04:01 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:49 EST, 20 August 2013 . Coronation Street star Chris Fountain has issued a grovelling apology after he was axed from the show after video clips appeared online showing him rapping about rape and violence. The Yorkshire-born actor, 25, conceded 'ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract' after it emerged that he was the star of the vile YouTube videos under the name of his rap alter-ego The Phantom. Soap bosses have already filmed a scene to explain the departure of his character Tommy Duckworth, which sees him flee Weatherfield after an argument with his girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Scroll down for video . Coronation Street's reputation hit a new low this week as Fountain was fired after being unmasked as the rapper behind hate-filled internet videos in which he threatened to rape, batter and stab women . On Monday evening, ITV confirmed that . the actor had been sacked from the soap, stating: 'Chris Fountain's . contract with ITV has been terminated as a result of the unacceptable . comments he made in a number of online clips.' Was ITV right to sack Chris Fountain from Coronation Street? 'Mortified' Fountain has issued an apology and said he is 'deeply ashamed' of the YouTube videos, which show the actor spouting lyrics about raping women, bombing houses and stabbing people in the face with syringes. In one distasteful clip, he raps . about dragging a girl upstairs, adding: \u2018I will **** anybody up in the . worst way, rape a b***h on her birthday.\u2019 The actor has said the explicit lyrics were 'blurted out in a moment of madness'. He said in a statement: 'I would like to . sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed . by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour. 'The videos were made . over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I\u2019ve not done . anything like it since and nor will I,' said the actor, who said he accepted ITV had 'no choice' but to end his contract. Show bosses have decided not to edit . Chris out of episodes he has already filmed so his character,\u00a0 mechanic Tommy Duckworth, will appear on TV this week. Family soap: Fountain, seen in a scene from the show with co-star Michelle Keegan, will not be edited out of upcoming episodes that have already been filmed . However, on Monday his former co-stars filmed scenes, which apparently showed David Platt (Jack P Shepherd) telling Tina that Tommy had taken a flight after a row with her. In scenes which are likely to be broadcast in around six weeks time, David tells Tina: 'Tommy proper kicked off. He packed a bag and went off to the airport.' Over the weekend Coronation Street bosses reportedly urged Fountain to speak out on a television show such as Daybreak or This Morning in a bid to appease fans. 'The lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hip-hop that I was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness. There is absolutely no excuse - I take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women, rape and violence. I just want to apologise from the bottom of my heart to everyone who I have offended or upset. I completely understand that ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract today. I have had two wonderful years playing Tommy Duckworth with only happy memories of my time on Coronation Street. I am mortified that I have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days. My biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job, but that I have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and I am so very deeply ashamed of this. I am also mortified to have put my mother, grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve. I am so sorry. Once again to everyone who I have let down and hurt. I am deeply sorry.' A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'These videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation. 'But while they are furious, they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly... He is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on TV to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him.' The source suggested Fountain could appear on several TV shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible, or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal. But the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for Fountain at Coronation Street. In one of the shocking video clips the actor performs a . stabbing action while he raps: \u2018I\u2019m a nasty ****, I will punch you in . the face and you look like you\u2019ve been having some acupuncture \u2019cos my . fist is lethal. \u2018I\u2019m a ******* hero, you\u2019ve got ******* zero. I\u2019m a mother******* demon, I\u2019ll stab you in the face with a needle.\u2019 Fountain, . who finished runner-up in the third series of celebrity skating show . Dancing On Ice in 2008, also raps about being fed up with fame as he . lounges on a sofa with local rap group the West Yorkshire Cypher. \u2018**** . with me and you don\u2019t want to risk it, I\u2019ll play you like a board game. I\u2019m bored of fame so I\u2019m taking the rap game, remember the name, it\u2019s . ******* Phantom,\u2019 he raps. Last . night a spokesman for support service Rape Crisis said: \u2018This is yet . another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some . men. 'To dignify this with . the name \"music\" does music an injustice, but the far greater injustice . is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual . violence against women. \u2018If . these violent and hate-filled lyrics were directed against other groups . in society, they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated . as a crime.\u2019 Under fire: The 25-year-old actor, pictured at a Corrie party on July 26, has been slammed by charities and women's groups over his offensive lyrics . Faye Maxted, . chief executive of The Survivors Trust, said: \u2018He is a high-profile . character. It shows a complete lack of any kind of respect for women at . all.\u2019 Fountain, who has been dating girlfriend Jessica Derrick since 2010, has insisted the controversial lyrics 'in no way' represent his attitude towards women, rape or violence. Coronation Street producers immediately suspended him from the show, in which he has played mechanic Tommy Duckworth since 2011, when news of his rap alter-ego broke. Lounging: Chris, AKA The Phantom, raps while sat on a sofa with a group of pals. His video has since been removed from YouTube . Behind the mask: Chris Fountain has expressed his 'deep shame' at appearing in YouTube videos as masked rapper The Phantom . An . ITV spokesman said when the videos first emerged: \u2018ITV finds the language used and the views . expressed in this video totally unacceptable. Chris Fountain has been . suspended pending further inquiries into this matter.\u2019 The . former Hollyoaks star has changed his YouTube privacy settings to try . to ensure the series of five videos \u2013 already seen by thousands \u2013 can no longer be . viewed. However, other versions had been uploaded yesterday, meaning they were still widely available for viewing. An . official Twitter account belonging to The Phantom, which reportedly . contained a tweet in which he boasts about killing a rap rival, has also . been hastily removed. Loved up: Chris with his girlfriend of three years Jessica Derrick at the British Soap Awards in 2012 . Out with the lads: Chris Fountain was in high spirits last week when he paid a visit to Eivissa Nightclub in Manchester with a group of pals . But there were still pictures of the actor on the West Yorkshire Cypher . website yesterday, among images of members of the group smoking what . appear to be cannabis spliffs. Fountain first rose to fame as Justin Burton in Channel 4 teen drama Hollyoaks, before taking part in Dancing On Ice.

        "article": "There are a lot of things that 3-year-old Beckett Roerdink could ask for on his birthday \u2014 chief among them a miracle for the incurable cancer he's battled since doctors found a tumor lodged in his tiny brain. But there is only one thing the Wisconsin boy wants when he blows out his candles this coming Wednesday: lots of letters. 'He loves mail, so any time he gets mail he gets super excited,' mother Melanie Roerdink, of Greenville, told the Appleton Post-Crescent. Scroll down for video . Last year, Beckett's parents thought he might not make it to his next birthday. He turns four on Wednesday, Sept. 17 . Beckett, 3, is a bright little boy who loves getting mail. He's hoping for lots of letters when he turns 4 years old on Wednesday . Birthday letters for little Beckett, who turns four on Wednesday, Sept. 17, should be sent to: . W6871 Sunnyvale Lane Apartment E Greenville, WI 54942 . To help with Beckett's medical expenses, follow this link. 'It would just be so awesome if he would . just get a bunch of cards for his birthday,' the mother told the Post-Crescent. Roerdink's nightmare began in April 2013, when an MRI revealed that Beckett had a large tumor growing in his brain. Days later, doctors removed the tumor in two separate surgeries, but he was left paralyzed but for his left hand, the Post-Crescent reported. But the side effects have taken a toll on the family: Beckett was left paralyzed but for his left hand. He has been in speech and physical therapy ever since, learning to walk and talk while he tries to adapt to life in preschool. 'We look at everything differently,' Roerdink said. 'We pretty much live one day at a time and feel beyond . blessed. We see things in a whole different light.' Beckett now wears an eye patch for a few hours each day due to nerve damage from the surgery and his balance is a bit off, the Post-Crescent reported. He also has to make constant trips to Texas for further testing and has MRIs every three months to check for recurring tumors. Beckett's 6-year-old brother Ethan shows off his shaved head in support of his little brother. With them, parents Kevin and Melanie Roerdink . Sure, every kids likes toys. But this year, all that Beckett wants is letters in the mail . Through it all, the little Wisconsin boy remains a real trooper. 'Beckett is the sweetest, most . patient boy,' Roerdink told the Post-Crescent. 'You can't not love him. 'Everyone loves him. He's real . easygoing but maybe because he's had no other choice.\" The ordeal has taken a huge emotional and financial on the family, so they're happy for a chance to celebrate. 'Milestones are huge because we didn't even think that we would get through surgery,' Roerdink told the Post-Crescent. 'We have to do something to celebrate because it's a big deal.' Beckett's parents have established a page for those wishing to follow his progress and donate to help with medical expenses. That site can be found here. September is national Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. 'I only have one true wish and that's they find a cure, the mother told the newspaper. 'And I hope he has many more birthdays.' Beckett is still struggling to walk and talk like most little boys his age, but he doesn't give up easily .",

        "article": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:10 EST, 9 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 9 January 2013 . The leader of the young wing of the UK Independence Party has been fired after saying he backed gay marriage. Olly Neville claims he was asked to stand down after being told his remarks were 'quite simply completely at odds' with the official party policy and put gains in opinion polls at risk. UKIP insists Mr Neville was forced out after defying party policy on a range of subjects, including legalising drugs. Former youth leader Olly Neville claims UKIP is on the 'wrong side of history' in opposing gay marriage . Mr Nevile was appointed as interim chairman of Young Independence (YI) at the end of last year but on January 2 backed gay marriage in an interview with BBC Radio4\u2019s World at One. UKIP opposes same-sex marriage, warning it would \u2018risk the grave harm of undermining the rights of Churches and Faiths to decide for themselves who they will and will not marry\u2019. But after being ousted, Mr Nevile said: \u2018On gay marriage the party is on the wrong side of public opinion and the wrong side of history. \u2018It could be another burka ban issue for them, where they will look back ashamedly and wonder why we had that as a policy,\u2019 he told The Independent. UKIP Leader has opposed gay marriage plans fearing churches would be threatened will be forced by European courts to hold same-sex weddings . In an email UKIP chairman Stephen Crowther told Mr Neville yesterday: \u2018The NEC [National Executive Committee] has resolved that you should not continue to act as interim chairman of YI, owing to the problems regarding party policy and public statements about which we have corresponded over the past week.\u2019 Mr Crowther said the BBC Radio 4 interview was \u2018politically inept\u2019. The email said: \u2018\u2026your stated position on Gay Marriage is quite simply completely at odds with the Party's policy. 'Our policy on Gay Marriage is extremely important to us at this time. \u2018We have said specifically and repeatedly that we are opposed to the government's proposals on this, and that the Prime Minister has got it spectacularly wrong. \u2018For you to say precisely the opposite, on national radio, as the representative of YI, is absolutely unacceptable, and risks seriously setting back the party's current growth.\u2019 However, today Mr Crowther insisted Mr Neville was \u2018asked to stand down\u2019 because he \u2018did not fully appreciate the responsibilities attached to an official Party role\u2019. \u2018In relation to the Party's policies on areas including gay marriage, the European elections, the legalisation of drugs and prostitution among others, Mr Neville has been publicly at odds with the Party over the past few weeks,\u2019 Mr Crowther added.",

        "article": "By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 08:22 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 18 October 2013 . A boy who developed anorexia after being bullied as a teenager has overcome his eating disorder to become a personal trainer and model. At his lowest weight last year, Carl Creasey, 22, from Rainham, Essex, weighed just 5st 5Ib. He would closely monitor what he ate, measuring out tiny portions, and then exercise as much as he could to burn off calories. He would also avoid mealtimes in an attempt to conceal his problem from family and friends. Buffed up:\u00a0 Carl once weighed 5st 5lb, left,\u00a0 but now he has a six pack after beating anorexia . He said: 'I use to do whatever I could to avoid food and sometimes avoided coming home just not to eat. I was addicted to the scales and if I wasn't losing weight I would increase my exercise. Sometimes I would go through the day with just a banana and cereal bar. 'I was obsessed with weight and measuring my food. I would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods.' Carl explained how his anorexia started after he was bullied at school and he 'saw food as the . only thing that I could control.' Transformation: He was once bullied at school and skipped meals to gain some control over his life but now has the confidence to model . In October 2012, he spent a month in a rehabilitation centre for people with eating disorders after doctors were concerned at how skinny he had become and feared his could only have months to live. The stay helped him change his attitudes towards food and set him on the road to recovery. He then became interested in bodybuilding after seeing how a friend had transformed their physique after taking up the sport. He realised if he wanted to get a buff body, he would have to eat more - to give his body fuel to work out and protein to build muscle and aid his recovery from exercise. He said: 'I knew things had to change and I . had always admired the bodybuilding physique. I knew if I was to get . that kind of body then I would need to eat and supplement properly so I . started going to the gym. I took it easy at first and built my way up . learning and taking advice from friends and other gym goers. Changed man: Carl now knows the importance of a healthy diet to give him a lean, toned body . Before . Breakfast: Cereal BarLunch: One bananaDinner: Nothing or a salad Now . Breakfast: PorridgeLunch: Chicken breast sandwiches with saladMid Afternoon: YogurtDinner: Steak, potatoes and vegetables Supper: A protein shake. He will also take a variety of LA Muscle supplements throughout the day . 'I was doing a lot of exercise when I . was ill whereas now I know the importance of resting and eating properly . to let the body recover and grow.' Carl's self-esteem grew as well as his muscle tone and he decided to make a career out of his new hobby by qualifying to be a personal trainer. He loves being able to help other people get the physiques they want through a balanced diet and sensible exercise. He said: 'I now help and encourage others to beat their eating disorder as skipping meals is not the way forward.' He now weighs 10st and said his confidence is 'sky high' - so much so that he has taken up modelling for brands including his sponsor, LA Muscle, and his new goal is to compete in fitness competitions.",

        "article": "By . Ruth Styles . It was back to school for Spain's Queen Letizia today as she welcomed students from Madrid's Francisco de Vitoria University to the Zarzuela Palace. The 41-year-old was glamorous in a neat pink cardigan, floral skirt and a pair of her trademark court shoes - a look that was a far cry from the scruffier get-ups that dominated her student days. Spain's new queen boasts not one but two degrees: the first in journalism from the Complutense University of Madrid and the second a master's course in the same subject from the University of Guadalajara in Mexico. Scroll down for video . Elegant: Queen Letizia was glamorous in pink as she welcomed students to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid . During her time in Mexico, Letizia combined her studies with a job selling cigarettes - a fact recently revealed by a set of intriguing old photographs released to newspapers last week. Dressed in a pair of high-waisted denim jeans, an unflattering baggy shirt and carrying a large red bag, the ensemble was a far cry from the glamorous wardrobe she enjoys today. Letizia studied in Mexico after completing a course in journalism in the early 1990s at the University Complutense of Madrid. After spending time in Guadalajara in the mid-90s, she returned to Spain, where before meeting Prince Felipe, she worked as a newsreader for CNN. Changing times: Letizia's current glamorous look is a far cry from the jeans of her student years . Clever: The newly crowned Queen of Spain has two degrees, both of which are in journalism . Looking good: Before marrying King Felipe, Letizia worked as a newsreader on the TVE news programme . Memorable moment: Students from the Madrid university pose for photos with Queen Letizia and King Felipe . She later went on to become the main anchor on Spain's TVE news programme, which led her to meeting her future husband. That husband, the newly crowned King Felipe, looked relaxed and happy as he joined his wife in welcoming students from the European Scholarships programme to the Zarzuela Palace. The royal couple, who were crowned last month, have recently returned from the third state visit of their short reign, this time to Rabat in Morocco where they met King Mohammed VI and visited the tomb of his father, Mohammed V. Next on the agenda for the couple is a state visit to France along with a string of engagements in their native Spain. Busy: Since being crowned last month, Queen Letizia has made three foreign trips including to Morocco . Meeting of monarchs: During their trip to Rabat, the Spanish royal couple met King Mohammed VI .",

        "article": "By . Luke Garratt . Some days you can spend hours driving around the tight corners of Paris looking for a parking space. But this took a whole new meaning, when he was forced into an incredibly tight spot when his search for a space went terribly wrong, leading him to drive into a Metro station. The driver was found pitched down the stairs to the entrance of the Champs Elys\u00e9es Metro station, one of the busiest in the city. Wrong turn: A Paris driver accidentally drove into the entrance of one of the busiest Metro stations in the city . Eventually a truck was called in to tow the car out, which drew a massive crowd, presumably much to the driver's embarrassment . The driver was focused on parking his car he failed to notice he was pulling into the station entrance and not a space. French media reports didn't say if anyone was injured, or if alcohol was the cause of the incident, but it seemed the driver only realised his mistake after driving down quite a few stairs. Twitter user Sofiane posted a picture, with the description: 'A bloke who confused an entry to the underground car park with the entrance of the Metro.' Members of the RATP, the state-owned public transport operator, security services stand in front of a car stuck at the entrance of a subway station in Paris . The driver is thought to have been searching for a space on the incredibly busy street, and driven into the station thinking it was one of Paris' many underground car parks . The Metro has over 300 stations in Paris, and hundreds of thousands of drivers, and this could be why this particular parking gaffe wasn't the first to have happened in the City of Light. In 2012, a driver identified only as Johan, 26 at the time, drove his 4x4 SUV partly into the entrance of the Chausee D\u2019Antin Metro, shortly before realising it was not a station entrance. At the time the driver said he was completely sober, and also claimed he had simply taken a wrong turn. He said: 'There was a sign indicating parking for the Haussmann shops just . in front of me, and there was no kerb next to the entrance of the . steps, so that's how I made the mistake. 'By chance there wasn't anyone on the steps.' 'It was one of the strangest things I've seen in along time,' said an eye-witness who was sitting in a nearby cafe at the time. Bizarre: In 2012 a confused tourist tried to drive his car down into a Paris Metro station after mistaking it for a car park . Weird: Eyewitnesses said it was one of the strangest things they had ever seen . Blunder: Fortunately the Frenchman managed to brake hard as soon as he realised what was happening .

        "article": "Eileen Clark, who lived in the UK for . 16 years after fleeing an allegedly abusive husband, has been extradited . to the US on charges of kidnapping their children . A mother of three who has been living openly in Britain for 16 years after fleeing an allegedly abusive husband has been extradited to the US on charges of kidnapping their children . Eileen Clark, a 57-year-old American citizen living near Oxford, was handed over to US marshals at Heathrow Airport on Thursday. Charged with international parental kidnapping even though her three grown-up children support her, Mrs Clark will face a courtroom confrontation with her husband. Her supporters say it is yet another example of how Britain\u2019s Extradition Act is unfair and is being misused. Liberty, which has represented Mrs Clark, said an emergency injunction to halt her removal had been refused just hours before she was flown to the US on Thursday. Two medical reports had certified that she was unfit to fly but \u2018disgracefully, even that evidence wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Home Office from handing her over,\u2019 said Liberty legal officer Emma Norton. The charity said that removing the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 and \u2018terrified\u2019 woman was a \u2018perfect example of how inhuman, unbalanced and unjust our extradition system has become\u2019. Witnesses said she was so distressed that she had to be taken on to the plane in a wheelchair. A Metropolitan Police officer had to intervene when the marshals tried to restrain her for the flight, informing them the Home Secretary had advised against it. A former model, Mrs Clark left her unhappy marriage nearly 20 years ago, first moving to live with friends in California and New Mexico, and later taking her young children to live with her in Britain. Her ex-husband, John Clark, has pursued her in the US courts even though their three offspring \u2013 all of whom are now in their 20s \u2013 bitterly oppose her extradition. She was originally charged only with \u2018custodial interference\u2019 \u2013 not a criminal offence in Britain - after leaving her husband in 1995 but, after she instructed a US lawyer, Mrs Clark claimed she had been assured the charge had been dismissed. However, in 2010, she was told she faced extradition the far more serious offence of international parental kidnapping. Eileen Clark, 57, has been charged with international parental kidnapping even though her three grown-up children support her. She is pictured here with children Chandler, 22, far right, Hayden, 20 and Rebekah, 17, left, at home in Oxfordshire . Despite their age, all three children have been labeled \u2018endangered adults\u2019 by US authorities, who insist they only discovered she was living in Britain in 2008. The Home Secretary upheld the original extradition order last August but her case returned to court following new human rights submissions and new evidence that Mrs Clark was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her marriage. Last month, two High Court judges rejected the challenge, saying the PTSD claim was \u2018dubious\u2019. Lord Justice Treacy said the removal of children without parental consent was \u2018a serious matter\u2019. A Liberty spokesman said Mrs Clark will be held in custody in the US until she can get bail but would have trouble doing so as she has no permanent American address. Mrs Clark was handed over to US marshals at Heathrow Airport, pictured above, on Thursday. Her supports say it is another example of Britain's Extradition Act being misused . Mrs Clark claims the extradition is just part of her ex-husband\u2019s abuse, describing it as \u2018his final bid for power and control over me\u2019. Their daughter, Rebekah, said in May: \u2018I don\u2019t mean to sound melodramatic but I just think it would be the end of her.\u2019 Mrs Clark claims her ex-husband used to hit her, once threatening to push her down a flight of stairs when she was pregnant. The decision to extradite Mrs Clark was also condemned by the domestic violence charity Refuge. Sandra Horley, its chief executive, said her forced return to the US was a \u2018bleak day\u2019 and set \u2018an incredibly dangerous precedent\u2019. She said: \u2018Eileen alleges that she experienced years of domestic abuse at his hands. It is highly disturbing that her claims have not been properly examined in a court of law in this country. Instead, this terrified woman is being handed back to the States to face criminal charges.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The high tides have been linked to yesterday's solar eclipse and 'supermoon', pictured is the promenade at Roker, Sunderland .

The 'supertide of the century' has been good news for surfers and more than 40 turned out to catch a rare 6ft high wave on the River Severn . A surfer takes on the tidal wave, known as a bore, on the River Severn at Minsterworth in Gloucestershire. It is one of only three expected this year . Flooding of homes and businesses is expected in North Tyneside and Sunderland as well as the Somerset coast and the Wye Estuary at Brockweir. High tides have been forecast for the next two days, according to data by the National Tidal and Sea Level Facility. Tides will be 2.5m higher than other times in Milford Haven, south Wales, 1.5m higher in Plymouth, Devon, and the Isle of Mull, western Scotland, and 0.5m higher in London on the tidal Thames. Flood alerts were  issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham as well as the River Avon and Devon coast. An EA spokesman said: 'These are spring tides, and higher due to the moon's 18-year cycle. High tides may lead to spray on promenades.' The Scottish Environment Protection Agency said: 'Spring tides are expected. There may be high waves.' A Severn bore tidal wave ranked a maximum level five today and a level four wave has been predicted for the next two days. At least seven flood warnings were issued today by the Environment Agency, pictured waves crash over the promenade at Roker, Sunderland .

A Severn bore tidal wave ranked a maximum level five today and a level four wave has been predicted for the next two days . The phenomenon is one of only three expected this year, with the first last month and the third expected later in the year . The bore, caused by a 'super tide' which hits the flow of the river, arrived at Newnham-on-Seven, Gloucester at 7.33am and surfers rode it upriver for several minutes . The phenomenon is one of only three expected this year, with the first last month and the third expected later in the year. It arrived at Newnham-on-Seven, Gloucester at 7.33am and surfers rode it upriver for several minutes. The bore, caused by a 'super tide' which hits the flow of the river, did not last long, but it left fans and photographers delighted. Photographer Clive Mowforth, 58, said: 'It was very crowded. It was certainly more crowded than last month. It was lovely and sunny this morning. Everyone had a great time. There was probably about 40 people there. 'Some of them had a good ride. Inevitably, it didn't last very long.' Forecasters did not predict any major rainfall over the next few days, but said there could be outbreaks in the South East and Northern parts of Scotland.

High tides saw water seeping over the banks of the River Thames today as flood alerts remained in place for parts of the capital . The Thames Barrier was closed today to protect London from the so-called 'high tide of the century' as a 'supermoon' linked to yesterday's solar eclipse caused rising water levels . Around 700 pagans, druids and revellers celebrated the spring equinox earlier today at Stonehenge in\u00a0Amesbury, Wiltshire . Revellers dance and play music during celebrations marking the  vernal equinox and the beginning of spring at Stonehenge . The Met Office said the first week of Easter holidays, which begin on Friday, will see highs of 10C and a mix of clear spells and showers or persistent rain. Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: 'Conditions will feel quite cold from Monday due to brisk north-westerly winds bringing polar maritime air from Iceland's direction. 'Sleet could fall in Dartmoor, with snow on the highest Pennines, Cumbrian fells and north Wales mountains, and over 500m in Scotland. 'Temperatures will generally be below average with some frosty nights. Nights could see down to -2C in England's North and Scotland. 'Temperatures will return to nearer normal by Thursday. Into the weekend and next week see a mixture of sunshine, showers, one or two persistent rainbands and breezier conditions. 'There's no signal for warm spells.' Weather Channel forecaster Leon Brown said: 'The next week will be quite cold with temperatures down to -3C to -5C in rural areas, with a wetter and windier spell of weather at the end of March.'

        "article": "By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . The world's first suicide prevention app is set to be launched in Australia, specifically targeting young people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. iBobbly is a joint venture between Black Dog Institute and the Western Australia based suicide prevention group Alive and Kicking Goals and aims to reach young people in indigenous communities. Suicide is the leading cause of death among all Australians aged between 15 and 44 years-old and accounts for 1.6 percent of all deaths on a national level. But among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, suicide counts for 4.2 percent of all deaths and the suicide rate of young indigenous Australians is five times higher than the rate for non-indigenous youth. iBobbly is the first suicide prevention app in the world and aims to reduce the rate of suicide among indigenous Australians . 'We know what the risk factors are for suicide in the general population and those risk factors are more prevalent in some Aboriginal communities \u2013 social and econ disadvantage, isolation, and we know that when unemployment goes up so does the rate of suicide,' Dr Fiona Shand, research fellow at Black Dog Institute told Daily Mail Australia. 'That's only one part of it though, what we know is that there's been clusters of suicide, it gets to a level in some communities where suicide becomes a normal coping mechanism,' she said. The app, the first of its kind in the world, derives its name from a Kimberley greeting, \"Ay bubbly?\", which means \"Hey brother, how you doing?\" Its aim is to decrease suicidal thinking and increase help-seeking among indigenous youth, particularly those in remote communities which are often lacking essential health services. 'We know that indigenous Australians are not seeking face to face mental health care, more than 70 percent of indigenous suicides occur in people who are not previously known to health services,' said Dr Shand. 'Indigenous youth have a high rate of mobile phone usage so it makes sense that we engage them on technology they are comfortable with and able to use in their own private time.' The app, the first of its kind in the world, derives its name from a Kimberley greeting . The app is a joint venture between Black Dog Institute and WA-based charity Alive and Kicking Goals . The app aims to reach people who may not have access to mental health services in their community . Dr Shand and other researchers have spent the last year in the Kimberley region work-shopping the app and trying to find out how to reach indigenous youth. The app works by teaching young people psychological lessons and helping them to deal with negative emotions through interactive games, which often draw from indigenous metaphors, images and stories. Dr Fiona Shand, research fellow from the Black Dog Institute, has been working with local indigenous youth in the Kimberly, work-shopping methods to engage with indigenous youth . For example, says Dr Fiona Shand, the app uses metaphors drawn from nature to explain psychological concepts and has suggestions for dealing with emotions that are culturally relevant. 'We suggest going and having a conversation with someone in your first language if your first language is an indigenous language [if feeling strong negative emotions], so some of those more culturally relevant activities,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Another aim of the app is to provide a way for indigenous young people to seek help anonymously, which is often impossible for people living in small. 'What we know is that particularly among young men, the rate of help seeking incredibly low and one of the big barriers is shame. What we're testing is whether an intervention that is relatively anonymous could help with that. If you're living in a small community and everyone knows everyone, how do you anonymously seek help?' said Dr Shand. A pilot testing the government-funded app in the Kimberley is about to come to a close and the researchers will look to expand into a nationwide trial next year before launching. Anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact Lifeline on 131 114 (Australia) the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255 (USA) or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 (UK), or a local help group .",

        "article": "This disturbing image appears to show two headless bodies dumped on the streets of Mexico City. In the photograph, two bodies - both wrapped in plastic and bound with tape - can be seen lying on the side of a road in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico City. Both of the unidentified corpses appear to be headless in the image. According to local media, the crime scene was first cordoned off on Sunday morning - shortly after the bodies were discovered. Two bodies were dumped wrapped in plastic and bound in tape were discovered on the streets of Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico city on Sunday. Neither have been identified . They were found in the Nezahualcoyotl neighborhood\u00a0 - an area on the outskirts of Mexico City that is known for its high crime rate and gang culture. The two appear to be further victims of drugs cartels - which are common in the area. Mexico City and its surrounding states have long be gripped by violence on the streets - with much of it linked to members of drugs cartels who battle over their 'patches'. Many towns in the area now have groups of vigilantes who attempt to enforce the law on such groups. Only last week, Mexican authorities confirmed four human heads were found in a town in Michoacan - a state west of Mexico City. The western state is home to hundreds of vigilantes\u00a0 - many of which sprang up a year ago to drive out members of drugs cartel the Knights Templar. A federal official said police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains - but wouldn't reveal its content. Last week four human heads were found in Zacan, Michoacan. The state is home to hundreds of vigilantes - many of whom are attempting to drive out members of drugs cartels . He confirmed the bodies belonged to four men aged between 22 and 55. Vigilantes began rising up against the Knights Templar in February 2013. Last month, the Mexican government effectively legalized the movement after an agreement was reached with group leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into quasi-military groups. Last September, six severed human heads were found over two days in the town of Los Reyes - also in Michoacan. The heads all belonged to males and had bullet wounds, reports at the time suggested. Local people in the area have set up a self-defence force to protect against the influence of the drug gangs. However, some residents of the area have reacted in protest at the presence of the groups. Last Thursday, at least three trailer trucks were set alight when 600 arrived in Paracuaro, Michoacan. At the time, residents said they oppose the vigilantes because they are forcing young men to join them. At the end of last year, officers began excavating 28 graves in the town of La Barca, Jalisco - after 62 bodies were discovered in a mass grave.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel. In a televised address carried by Hezbollah's station al Manar, Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people. Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni-led governments in the Arab world. But Nasrallah's language Monday came close to promoting their overthrow. The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt's affairs. In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt, Nasrallah said the militia's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation. Nasrallah's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government. The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down last month, and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government. At the same time, tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, Saad's father, in 2005. Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination, describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States. Saad Hariri says his party won't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal. Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri's death on February 14. The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications, construction and other businesses. He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis, Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon's many parties. Some Lebanese politicians, notably the veteran Nabih Berri, a Shiite, are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week. Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal's indictments, which for now are sealed. Lebanon's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex. Some Christian families, notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party, are allied with the Sunni Hariri's party and want to see Hezbollah's wings clipped. Besides its political strength, Hezbollah's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel. But another prominent Christian, Michel Aoun, is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah. And Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the minority Druze community, has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah, even though Jumblat's father was killed by the Syrians. Aoun was brutally honest about his choice: \"We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah.\" In other words, the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon. Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other.",

        "article": "Margaret Thatcher made repeated attempts to win a knighthood for Jimmy Savile\u00a0 despite warnings about his \u2018manner of life\u2019. The former prime minister made at least five requests for the now-disgraced DJ to be considered for the top honour, but senior civil servants voiced fears about his \u2018strange and complex\u2019 private life. Previously unseen documents from the Cabinet Office reveal the extent of unease about the BBC presenter, almost three decades before he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile. Persistent: Margaret Thatcher with Jimmy Saville outside No 10 Downing Street in 1988, as it was revealed she tried five times to get him knighted while prime minister . Misgivings...and the PM's retort. Civil servants were 'worried' while Mrs Thatcher felt press reports on Savile were no forgotten . There is no suggestion that Baroness Thatcher or her aides were aware of his vile abuse of children as young as eight. Shamed DJ: Cigar-smoking Jimmy Savile pictured after receiving his knighthood at the Palace in 1990 . But the official documents show that . while BBC bosses were apparently willing to ignore the presenter\u2019s . private life, Whitehall mandarins privately voiced their misgivings . about handing him a knighthood. The files, made public under the . Freedom of Information Act, show Mrs Thatcher wanted to bestow the . honour to reward Savile\u2019s charity work. But her aides feared a scandal would . engulf him and expressed fears he would \u2018exploit\u2019 a knighthood and taint . the entire honours system. Mrs Thatcher eventually succeeded in . her quest and the DJ and Jim\u2019ll Fix It presenter was made Sir Jimmy . Savile in 1990, a month after she left Downing Street. The Cabinet Office correspondence . showed her requests on his behalf began at least seven years earlier in . 1983 \u2013 the year Savile boasted to journalists that he bedded women he . met while running charity marathons. Her request was vetoed by the honours . committee, whose chairman Robert\u00a0 Armstrong said it was too soon after . Savile\u2019s \u2018unfortunate revelations\u2019. Mrs Thatcher repeated her request in . October that year but Mr Armstrong, who was also her Cabinet Secretary, . voiced \u2018continued misgivings\u2019. The civil servant said: \u2018We remain . worried ... Fears have been expressed that Mr Savile might not be able . to refrain from exploiting a knighthood in a way which brought the . honours system into disrepute.\u2019 Warnings: Lady Thatcher's aides were critical of Jimmy Savile's private life, but the Tory leader insisted his charity work meant he should become 'Sir' Later requests were also refused, to Mrs Thatcher\u2019s evident exasperation. A letter from her private secretary . Nigel Wicks in 1986 said: \u2018She is most disappointed that Mr Savile\u2019s . name has not been recommended ... She wonders how many more times his . name is to be pushed aside.\u2019 The Government was spearheading a . high-profile campaign to highlight the spread of Aids and Mr Armstrong . said \u2018sexual promiscuity\u2019 like Savile\u2019s should not be encouraged. He wrote: \u2018The case of Jimmy Savile is difficult. Mr Savile is a strange and complex man. \u2018He deserves high praise for the lead he offers in giving quiet background help to the sick. \u2018But he has made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life two or three years ago.\u2019 Savile raised more than \u00a330million . for good causes, including \u00a312million to rebuild the National Spinal . Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, and he . was given an OBE in 1971. Correspondence: A handwritten letter from Jimmy Savile in which he declared his 'love' for Margaret Thatcher after being invited to lunch with her was released by the National Archives under the 30-year rule . But misgivings about his private life . meant civil servants continued to veto Mrs Thatcher\u2019s requests for him . to be given a higher award. Mr Armstrong\u2019s successor Robin Butler said the honours committee had rejected him for a knighthood again in 1987. A constitutional bar preventing the dead . from having their knighthoods removed means the government cannot strip Savile of the accolade . Those given a knighthood are awarded . lifetime membership to a \u2018living order\u2019 and the title no longer exists . when the holder dies. The TV host, who died aged 84, was . knighted in the Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which . followed the OBE he was given . in 1971. Whitehall sources admitted they considered awarding him a posthumous knighthood \u2013 so he could then be stripped of it. The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee. Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood. He wrote: \u2018My Committee and I still . fear that his manner of life \u2013 on his own confession \u2013 has been such . that a high award for him would be an unhelpful signal when we are still . having to grapple with an Aids problem which threatens to intensify. A . knighthood for him would not benefit the honours system in the eyes of . the public.\u2019 Previous government correspondence . has revealed that Savile wrote to Mrs Thatcher in 1980 and she invited . him to lunch at Chequers. She subsequently spent 11 consecutive New Year\u2019s Eves with him and oversaw his eventual knighthood in 1990. It was only after his death in 2011, aged 84, that he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims. His decades of child abuse prompted . calls for the Honours Forfeiture Committee to revoke his knighthood, but . officials claimed it was impossible as the honour formally ended when . he died. The Cabinet Office originally refused the Freedom of . Information request to release the secret files, made by The Sun . newspaper last October. But the Information Commissioner\u2019s . Office upheld an appeal, ruling there was \u2018compelling public interest\u2019 to release the files from the 1980s. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: . \u2018There is no indication in the papers that anything was known then about . the allegations that have subsequently come to light about Jimmy . Savile. The honours process was followed in accordance with the system . at the time.\u2019",

        "article": "It has long been considered that a lie-flat bed is the only way to get a good night's sleep on a plane. But Boeing has issued a patent for a bizarre 'upright' sleeping support system that could mean economy passengers can sleep on long-haul flights too. Nicknamed the 'cuddle chair,' the somewhat comical idea could revolutionise the plane sleeping experience by eliminating the need for reclining seats at all. Boeing has just filed a patent for a 'transport vehicle upright sleep support system' known as a 'cuddle chair' It looks like a backpack and fastens to the back of the headrest to allow passengers to lean forward and rest their face and chest on the contraption. According to the patent for the 'Transport Vehicle Upright Sleep Support System,' and illustrative animated video from website PatentYogi, the head cushion will have a 'face relief aperture,' which is essentially a face-front pillow with a hole for breathing. The chest cushion supports the passenger's chest in a natural, forward-leaning motion, which will helpfully aid the traveller in a few precious minutes of shut-eye. Sleeping on a plane can be quite a feat - especially for those who don't have the money to splurge on business or first class seats. While some rely on a personal neck pillow, which is readily available to purchase in airports, Boeing's patent insists that the 'cuddle chair' is a far superior option. For those sitting in economy aircraft seats, the 'cuddle chair' offers a more natural way to get some sleep . The backpack will be located under the seat and straps will attach to the passenger's head rest . A 'face relief aperture,' or a face pillow with a hole for breathing, and chest cushion provide added support . The patent insists that this system is far superior to neck pillows due to sleep's 'natural horizontal tendency' Although a patent was filed, Boeing tells MailOnline Travel that no further information is currently available . According to the patent, the inflatable pillow is 'not a highly successful option due to the natural tendency of a sleeper to relax their muscles and fall to a more horizontal point.' If you're using a neck pillow, this may be the moment that it slips and you wake up. However, it may be a while until we see the 'cuddle chair' installed on Boeing aircraft, as the aviation company tells MailOnline Travel that it 'files many patents every year, but that doesn't necessarily mean we end up pursuing them.' A spokesperson for Boeing adds: 'We aren't providing any further information or comment beyond what was detailed in the patent filing.'",
        "highlights": "Recent patent filing shows plans for an 'upright' sleeping support system .\nEncased in a backpack, the cushions allow the passenger to lean forward .\nA breathing hole in the face pillow ensures extra customer comfort .\nBoeing says: 'We aren't providing any further information or comment'",

The injury sustained by actor Harrison Ford on set of the latest Star Wars movie was a broken left leg, it emerged today. The 71-year-old is said to be 'doing well' after undergoing surgery for the injury, which took place after he was crushed by the Star Wars spacecraft Millennium Falcon. The actor, who was filming Star Wars: Episode VII at the time, was originally thought to have damaged his ankle during the mishap at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire earlier this month. But a spokesman for the star has now confirmed the injury was a broken leg. Although she did not give any further details of the accident, she said the actor was due to start rehabilitation soon and was looking forward to returning to work. Ford, who is returning to his role as Han Solo in the latest film, was working in the UK on the series when the accident unfolded.

His publicist said today: 'Harrison . Ford's left leg was broken in an accident. 'His surgery was successful . and he will begin rehab shortly. He's doing well and looks forward to . returning to work.' Police said the crush involved a garage door, but it is believed the accident involved the door . of the Millennium Falcon. Ford was about to start a scene involving the 111ft vehicle when the incident occurred. There were also fears the actor may . also have suffered further injuries to his chest and pelvis but this has not been confirmed. After the incident, his son Ben said that film crews might need to rearrange scenes to only show the actor from the waist up, due to the injury.

The accident took place at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, . pictured, while the 71-year-old was filming Star Wars: Episode VII in . which he plays Han Solo . Disney, which owns Lucasfilm the company behind Star Wars, said after the incident that shooting would continue as planned while the star recovered. After the incident, a source told The Mirror: 'The initial . day or two after the accident it was hard to move things around but now . we have had more time we can juggle things, bring some scenes forward . and push others back. 'There are lots of other actors in the movie so it is not a disaster. We are confident the film can stay on schedule.' The actor, who also played Indiana Jones, was crushed on the set when a hydraulic door - believed to be from the spacecraft the Millennium Falcon - fell down and hit him . The \u00a3200million movie, which is being directed by JJ Abrams, has been earmarked for release in December next year, after filming began in Abu Dhabi in mid-May. Carrie .

Carter also claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible. Carter made the remarks during an episode of\u00a0CNBC Meets after Tania Bryer asked him 'Do you feel there were any choices you would have made differently?' 'I think I would have been re-elected easily if I had been able to rescue our hostages from the Iranians,' Carter said on the program. 'And everybody asks me what would do more, I would say I would send one more helicopter because if I had one more helicopter we could have brought out not only the 52 hostages, but also brought out the rescue team, and when that failed, then I think that was the main factor that brought about my failure to be re-elected. So that's one thing I would change.' Scroll down for video . Big birthday! Former President Jimmy Carter blew out birthday candles on his birthday cake Wednesday . Carter also said 'I could've been re-elected if I'd taken military action against Iran, shown that I was strong and resolute and, um, manly and so forth. 'But, er, I think if I, I could have wiped Iran off the map with the weapons that we had, but in the process a lot of innocent people would have been killed, probably including the hostages and so I stood up against all that, er, all that advice, and then eventually my prayers were answered and every hostage came home safe and free. And so I think I made the right decision in retrospect, but it was not easy at the time.' Carter lost in the 1980 presidential election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan. The fifty-two hostages were eventually released in January 1981. Sixty-six Americans were originally taken hostage from a US embassy in November 1979, CNN reported. Carter also celebrated his 90th birthday Wednesday in Atlanta, blowing out three candles representing the past, present and future and thanking family and friends for their support and love. 'It's been a good first 90 years,' the 39th president joked before telling the crowd gathered in a chapel on The Carter Center grounds that he is looking forward to much more work. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, founded the international health and human rights organization after leaving the White House. Not 'manly' enough? Carter, seen here with his family in 1980, claimed that if he proved himself 'manly' and used military force, a second term in the Oval Office would have been possible . Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. Carter said his life was most shaped by his marriage to Rosalynn and growing up in Plains, Georgia, where he worked and played with black children who didn't have the same rights as he because of their race. Carter said he still feels guilt for not realizing sooner how wrong that was. Being elected president, he said, was the highlight of his political life. However, he said he's had the 'best times' of his life since establishing The Carter Center, 'this beautiful place on earth that has set moral and ethical standards that exemplify what a superpower like America ought to be.' Rosalynn Carter choked up while introducing her husband, telling him she's proud of him for both his work and the family they built together. As for what's next, Rosalynn Carter said only one thing is certain. 'It will be something because Jimmy Carter is miserable if he's not doing something,' she said, laughing with the crowd. Carter is the second-oldest of the five living U.S. presidents. He was born 111 days after President George H.W. Bush, who celebrated his 90th birthday earlier this year.",

Karim Benzema put Real ahead in the 56th minute with a scrappy opening goal before Ronaldo headed in his 38th goal of the season with half an hour of the contest remaining. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner is now level with Galacticos legend Carlos Santillana. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring Real Madrid's second goal of the night against Elche .

Ronaldo is now just 17 goals behind second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader and club legend Raul. Sunday's victory puts Real four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga after Luis Enrique's side slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga.

        "article": "Google's Glass 'eye wear' could be potentially dangerous, leading professors have warned. The revolutionary 'wearable computer' could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity and distract wearers to the point where they miss things which are 'utterly obvious', they say. Daniel J. Simons, is a professor of psychology and advertising at the University of Illinois and Christopher F. Chabris, is a professor of psychology at Union College. The revolutionary 'wearable computer' Google Glass could disrupt crucial cognitive capacity, two leading experts have warned . Google Glass is a wearable computer with a head mounted display. It can connect with the internet via voice command and display information on the glass 'screens'. In a piece for the New York Times, the two experts examine the dangers the real-time digital distraction could pose. They write: '...most agree that a smartphone-linked display and camera placed in the corner of your vision is intriguing and potentially revolutionary \u2014 and like us, they want to try it. 'But Glass may inadvertently disrupt a crucial cognitive capacity, with potentially dangerous consequences.' Earlier this year Sergey Brin, one of Google\u2019s founders, said safety had actually been a motivation for the new product. He said: 'We questioned whether you should be walking around looking down at a smartphone.' He said designers wanted to make something that freed both the hands and the eyes. But the professors say when the mind is engaged, wearers could fail to see something that would 'otherwise be utterly . obvious.' They write: 'Google Glass may allow users to do amazing things, but it does not abolish the limits on the human ability to pay attention.' Google is already facing a growing backlash over its \u2018Glass\u2019 eyewear, with cafe owners in the US banning the technology from their premises. Earlier this year Sergey Brin, one of Google's founders, said safety had actually been a motivation for the new product . Dave Meinert, who runs the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, said those wearing the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in. He has put up a sign on the wall which reads: \u2018Respect our customers\u2019 privacy as we\u2019d expect them to respect yours.\u2019 The move comes after it emerged people wearing Google Glass could be banned from American cinemas, casinos and even parks because owners don\u2019t want filming there. The glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (\u00a3980), are currently on limited release to 2,000 customers but will be more widely available later this year. A camera next to the wearer\u2019s eye, which can take photos or record video without a red light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working, has caused concerns for privacy. Casinos said the futuristic eyewear could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies. Lap dance clubs said that they would treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out.",

The disgraced DJ, 69, showed no remorse as he said his conviction for molesting a young researcher at the BBC had left him \u2018mortified and disappointed\u2019. He ignored calls for him to apologise to his victim. In a defiant speech outside court Travis, who has called the case a celebrity witch-hunt, appeared to suggest the guilty verdict was the result of prosecution mud-slinging. He said: \u2018With millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money, thousands of hours of police resources, the judge accepted today that the Crown had failed to prove their case against me \u2013 namely that I was a sexual predator. Scroll down for video . Dave Lee Travis and his wife\u00a0Marianne arrive at Southwark Crown Court, where the former radio DJ was given a sentence of three months in prison suspended for two years . Travis was found guilty of groping a researcher in her 20s behind the scenes of the Mrs Merton Show . Travis (pictured leaving court) was found guilty of groping researcher's breasts for 10-15 seconds after he saw her smoking and said 'your poor little lungs' \u2018I have always worried, as have my close family and friends, that if the prosecution threw enough mud at me, some of it might stick. \u2018While I am relieved I have been able to prove that I am not a sexual predator, I am mortified that I was convicted of one count. And it is of little comfort to me that I was acquitted of so many others.\u2019 Former Top Of The Pops presenter Travis, who could have faced a maximum two-year jail sentence for indecent assault, was given a three-month sentence suspended for two years. Judge Anthony Leonard, QC, told Southwark Crown Court Travis had taken advantage of his status as a \u2018well-known media personality\u2019 to molest the 22-year-old researcher on the Mrs Merton Show in the belief \u2018she would not make a fuss\u2019. The woman, now a successful TV personality in her own right, said she was \u2018subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work\u2019 which left her \u2018paralysed with fear\u2019. Travis has protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as \u2018fantasists and liars\u2019. The Mrs Merton researcher said she had found suggestions that she was courting fame or seeking a financial pay-out particularly hurtful. Speaking outside court, Travis said he was 'mortified' and 'disappointed' that he had been found guilty . He added: 'Those close to me, including my wife Marianne (right) who has been by my side the whole time, we all know the truth and I am grateful for that' He also attacked his prosecution, which he said had cost the taxpayer 'millions' and used thousands of pounds of police resources . Judge Leonard said Travis had used his celebrity status and large frame to intimidate his victim. The victim told of her horror at the attack in an impact statement read to the court: . \u2018I was a naive and trusting 22-year-old when I was subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work. 'I was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant but immediately told my boss. \u2018I feel lucky, I was psychologically robust enough to deal with the distress, thanks largely to the support of my friends and colleagues. \u2018I have coped by using humour as a defence mechanism. But remembering the incident still takes me back to feeling like a scared, vulnerable young woman. 'Being called a liar and fantasist and being forced to relive the events of the past has been painful. I was particularly horrified at the defendant\u2019s allegations that desire for attention or financial greed motivated me. \u2018I have sought to preserve my anonymity and have no intention of claiming compensation now or in the future. I simply wanted to tell the truth and was prepared to go through this unpleasant process to that end. \u2018I am grateful I have always been believed by those who know me, and the members of the jury also appreciated I was telling the truth.\u2019 He told him: \u2018At over 6ft tall you towered over her\u2026 You pinned her up against the wall and started to touch her rib cage and slid your hands up over her breasts and her clothes, and started squeezing them. You left your hands there for several seconds. \u2018She said that, with you looming over her, she felt scared and when she got away she was shaking and a bit beside herself. She described her feeling of being violated.\u2019 The BBC now faces being sued by a number of women who claim Travis assaulted them during his 30-year career with the corporation. He could also face civil law suits, including one from a woman who claims he attacked her when she was a \u2018pre-teen\u2019 in the 1970s. Travis, who was tried under his real name David Griffin, was cleared earlier this year of 12 indecent assaults dating back to the mid-1970s, including an alleged assault on a 15-year-old girl. That jury failed to reach verdicts on alleged attacks against two other women and prosecutors decided he should face a retrial on those charges plus a third count of indecent assault against the Mrs Merton researcher, who had come forward during his first trial but was too late to be added to the charges. At the second trial he was convicted of that 1995 indecent assault, found not guilty of indecent assault on a second woman and the jury was hung on the other allegation, which was formally recorded as a not guilty verdict. Travis, who was not ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register because the indecent assault was committed in 1995, before the register was introduced, left court hand-in-hand with his wife Marianne, 66. Travis was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's \u00a33million investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile. Sentencing Travis, Judge\u00a0Leonard said the DJ's offence was of a 'different order' to other high profile convictions under Operation Yewtree . The court heard that Travis assaulted the woman in 1995 after appearing on the Mrs Merton Show (pictured) Max Clifford was sentenced to eight years in jail after being convicted of eight counts of indecent assault as part of Operation Yewtree . Dave Lee Travis is the third celebrity scalp to be claimed by sex crime inquiry Operation Yewtree. The 69-year-old was the fourth figure with links to the entertainment industry to be arrested as part of the investigation, which has now seen a total of 17 people questioned by police. The operation came in for criticism after its first two attempted prosecutions, against Coronation Street actors William Roache and Michael Le Vell, both ended with not guilty verdicts. However, in April this year the investigation secured its first conviction after Max Clifford was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on teenage girls, and sentenced to eight years in jail. During the trial the prosecution claimed the celebrity kiss-and-tell publicist took pleasure in degrading teenagers after he promised to make them Bond girls or TV stars. Rolf Harris was the second celebrity figure to be convicted after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault in June. He was jailed for five years for assaulting girls aged between seven and 19 over the course of three decades in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties. On the first day of his trial, Harris put on a confident display - singing Jake The Peg and explaining how he invented the wobble board - but was eventually undone after admitting he had found one of his 13-year-old victims attractive. Entertainer Rolf Harris is also serving time behind bars after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults . Operation Yewtree was launched in the wake of claims made against late DJ Jimmy Savile, who was exposed as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British history after an ITV documentary. So far eight people - including comedians Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr - have been told that no further action will be taken against them, and another three, including broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, remain on police bail. The other six have been charged. As well as the three convictions, former pop star Gary Glitter and ex-Radio One DJ Chris Denning are facing prosecution in separate cases. Driver David Smith was due to face trial but died before he could do so.",

        "article": "An Atlanta man shattered the record for fastest drive from New York City to Los Angeles last Saturday by making the transcontinental trip in 28 hours 50 minutes. Ed Bolian spent years outfitting a 2004 Mercedes with expensive gadgetry, spare gas tanks, and, of course, bedpans and finally realized his dream October 20. That smashes the record set in 2006 by an unbelievable two hours. But his attempt is sure to gather controversy as it involved traveling at an average of 98mph, well in excess of many speed limits. He also used a series of gadgets to avoid getting caught for speeding. Scroll down for video . Proud: Ed Bolian (center) is now the holder of fastest man to drive from New York to Los Angeles at his sides are his co-pilot Dave Black (right) and Dan Huang (left) Vaunted vessel: Bolian and company made their historic dash across the continent in this CL Class Mercedes and some help from a few extra gizmos and additions . Mind blowing: Atlanta Lamborghini dealership manager Ed Bolian has broken the record for fastest transcontinental drive from New York to Los Angeles by two hours. He did it in 28 hours 50 minutes . The Lamborghini dealership sales director is hesitant to show off the proof, but according to Jalopnik, the 27-year-old has GPS data tracking every inch of the journey he took with a co-pilot and passenger starting October 19. \u2018I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old,\u2019 Bolian said, explaining away the trip\u2019s huge costs and many risks. He began putting all the pieces together years ago, first by buying a used CL-Class blue Mercedes from a man in Palm Beach, Florida. \u2018I thought about a Ferrari 612,\u2019 said Ed. \u2018But gas mileage would've been bad. A Bentley would've been perfect, but you'd want the V8 for gas mileage, and those are still way too expensive.\u2019 Souped up: Bolian planned the trip for years and pumped untold sums into the car for GPS, laser jammers, CB radio, and other gizmos that helped ferry him safely and very quickly through a dozen states . Large tanks: In order to cut down on fuel stops, Bolian installed two 22-gallon addition gas tanks that let him drive 800 miles straight--with the help of bedpans . Previous record holder: Bolian's October 19 to 20 drive blows Alex Roy's 2006 record of 31 hours 4 minutes out of the water . Famous race: A zany 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds, Farrah Fawcett, and Dom Deluise immortalized the Cannonball Run, which took place in real life for much of the 1970s . The origins of the Cannonball Run aren't entirely clear, but the death defying and hugely illegal race from New York City to Los Angeles is named after Edwin 'Cannonball' Baker. Baker made history in 1933 when, apparently just to say he did it, he raced from coast to coast in 53 hours 30 minutes in a car called the Blue Streak. Fast forward to the 1970s, when cars could go far faster than Baker's Graham Paige, and Car and Driver editor Brock Yates created the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. For years, daring drivers vied for the title of what became known as the Cannonball Run. A 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds and Farrah Fawcett immortalized the name. The run was last completed by Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough in 32 hours 51 minutes behind the wheel of a Jaguar. Their record was next bested in the US Express race, which replaced the illicit Cannonball Run, by Doug Turner and David Diem. Their time of 32 hours and 7 minutes wasn't beaten until Alex Roy did it in 31 hours 4 minutes in a BMW in 2006. Now, they're all Cannonball also-rans and Bolian's feat won't be easily topped. He chose the Mercedes for its fuel economizing V8 engine and active suspension he needed in order to pack in as much fuel as possible. Bolian\u2019s whip boasts two additional 22-gallon gas tanks, which add hundreds of pounds of fuel but allow the car to travel 800 miles between stops. But breaking the record was going to take more than just a souped up Mercedes. To ensure a clear run, free from traffic jams and, perhaps more importantly, traffic cops Bolian, also invested in a police scanner, two GPS units that relay traffic information and iPhone apps such as Trapster. The car was also fitted with two laser jammers and had a truck mounted antenna. Friends were enlisted to travel along the route, about 150 miles ahead of the Mercedes, and check for any potential obstacles. Bolian decided to take the classic route pioneered by the illegal street racers of the 1970s\u2019 Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash of the 1970s AKA Cannonball Run: Red Ball Garage in Midtown Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California. 'I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old': Bolian has now lived his dream and didn't get a single ticket on the way . 'I don't even remember Indiana': Bolian says it was tough getting out of Manhattan, but once they did it was smooth sailing all the way to LA . Almost here: They got to California as the sun rose on October 20. They could have played it safe and gone the speed limit as the rising western sun blinded them Instead, they pushed it in order to make their feat all the more impressive . And they're off: The classic starting line and the place where Bolian's historic run began, the Red Ball Garage, sits between Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan . Cool finish: The Cannonball Run ends here, at Redondo Beach, California's Portofino Hotel, 2,813.7 from where it begins in New York City . \u2018Every year, Alex hears about five to seven attempts to break the record,\u2019 said E. \u2018None of the challengers come close.\u2019 But by far the most difficult part of Bolian\u2019s endeavor, he said, was finding people to make the trip with him. With only two weeks until he was scheduled to go, nobody had agreed to take on the challenge with him. Then, after trawling deep within his Facebook friends, he found Dan Huang. \u2018I got a Facebook message from Ed,\u2019 Huang told Jalopnik, \u2018He didn't even have my cell phone number.\u2019 Along with a friend of Bolian\u2019s, David Black, as co-pilot, the three of them piled into the Mercedes on October 19. Proof: Bolian used technology to track and eventually prove his feat, hiring a GPS company to follow him every inch of the way and even gauge his speed . Things did not go well initially. \u2018It took us 15 minutes to get out of Manhattan,\u2019 Ed said. But then things quickly picked up. They had friends drive ahead and check for cops and obstacles. New Jersey passed, then Pennsylvania, then Ohio. They kept a breakneck pace. \u2018I don't even remember Indiana,\u2019 Ed said. By the time they got to Texas, they were making such good time that they could have gone the speed limit the rest of the way and still tied Roy\u2019s time. Instead, they pushed it. And on October 20, they reached Redondo Beach, California\u2019s Portofino Hotel. They\u2019d beat the record by an astonishing two hours and gone down in history with the fastest Cannonball run drive in history. Astonishing: With Bolian at the wheel, Black as co-pilot, and Huang on a spare tire in back, the trio drove 2,813.7 in 28 hours 50 minutes .",
