        "article": "Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials warn the threat posed by a lone gunman or a group with small arms is a serious concern to law enforcement. A joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI cites the July attack in Norway as one very deadly example. Anders Behring Breivik allegedly shot and killed 69 people on the Norwegian island of Utoya. Authorities say earlier that day a vehicle bomb made by Breivik exploded in Oslo and killed eight people. The U.S. law enforcement bulletin issued Tuesday warns Breivik's preparations went undetected. The memo, which was obtained by CNN, says Breivik \"is believed to have acted alone and used legal methods to procure the vast majority of materials and weapons needed for his operation, successfully avoiding law enforcement suspicion.\" In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, President Barack Obama expressed concerned about lone wolf actors \"being able to carry out wide-scale massacres of the sort that we saw in Norway.\" He called the lone wolf worry \"the most likely scenario that we have to guard against right now.\" A law enforcement official told CNN the alert sent to state and local law enforcement was a \"cautionary kind of thing\" and was not the result of intelligence concerning a possible upcoming attack. The official noted the upcoming 10th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, but quickly added law enforcement is always worried about catching lone actors before they strike. The document lays out the singular challenge for law enforcement presented by lone wolves: \"Attacks by lone offenders -- which by definition lack co-conspirators, and therefore provide fewer opportunities for detection -- may be more difficult for law enforcement and homeland security authorities to disrupt.\" Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole says the lone wolf scenario remains a concern, and intelligence is the \"best tool\" to prevent it. \"There are a number of trip wires in place around the country that the FBI and others have, state and local police. Those are the best opportunities to detect and deter a possible terrorist. That being said there are those individuals -- lone wolves that I referred to -- that do things on their own,\" Pistole told CNN. Speaking before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at a \"See Something, Say Something\" public awareness event on Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, \"We're seeing smaller plots using a variety of techniques ... we're also seeing the rise of activities by individuals who are actually in the country. And they're acting by themselves. And that kind of attack is the most difficult to prevent.\" However, the United States has had success detecting lone wolf plots. The bulletin points to the July 27 arrest of an AWOL soldier named Naser Abdo who allegedly wanted to attack soldiers at gathering spots near Fort Hood in Texas. The document says law enforcement found bomb-making materials in Abdo's hotel room but law enforcement was alerted in time to avert an attack thanks to a warning from a gun store employee who found Abdo's behavior suspicious. But another plot involving Fort Hood was not detected, which resulted in tragic consequences. In November 2009, Army Maj. Nidal Hasan allegedly opened fire in a center where soldiers were preparing to deploy overseas. Armed with two pistols, Hasan allegedly killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others. The bulletin also warns terrorist groups overseas \"have long favored small unit assault tactics, in which small teams of operatives storm a target using small arms to defeat security.\" U.S. officials say they have found \"no information indicating transnation terrorists have attempted to execute a small-unit assault operation in the homeland.\" But the document lists two homegrown plots that were disrupted. One involved six people found guilty of plotting to attack a military base at Fort Dix, New Jersey. A second one listed by DHS and FBI officials concerns two men who allegedly wanted to strike at a Military Entrance Processing Station in Seattle. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.",

        "article": "By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 12:01 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:43 EST, 20 November 2012 . Once every office and most homes in the UK rattled and rang with their unmistakable sound but today marked the end of an era for the humble typewriter. The last one to be made in Britain has been taken off the factory floor as Brother stopped manufacturing the machine at its north Wales factory. The company has made 5.9 million in Wrexham since 1985 and has sent its last typewriter to the Science Museum in London to be displayed as an artefact. Historic: Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter and is shown here doing a final test on the production line . The original: This machine dates back to July 1985 and was the first to be made at Brother's Wrexham factory . After 130 years it is has finally become a victim of the computer-dominated world as Brother said demand in Britain had fallen to the point where it was no longer financially viable to keep making them. Edward Bryan, a worker at the factory since 1989, made the last typewriter. 'If people ever ask me, I can always say now, as a strange question, that I\u2019ve made the last typewriter in the UK,' he said. 'I have made so many typewriters down the years. I once managed to make one with my eyes closed.' Made in Britain: Rachel Bloon from the Science Museum is handed the artefact by Craig McCubbin and Phil Jones from Brother UK . End of an era: The typewriter are of manufacturing at Brother's factory in Wrexham (pictured) ended today . The company said that it still had significant sales in the U.S. - where government departments and some offices still use them - but Brother's factory in the Far East produces enough typewriters to serve this market. Despite its British-sounding name Brother is a Japanese company from Nagoya that started life in 1908 as the Yasui Sewing Machine Company. It was given an English title, Brother, in 1954 to establish itself in the international market. Four years later a European division was set up in 1958 in Dublin and ten years later moved its UK headquarters to Audenshaw in Manchester after they bought the famous Jones Sewing Machine brand. In 2012, Brother's annual turnover was in excess of \u00a33.8bn per year with its main manufacturing centres in China, Taiwan and soon Vietnam. It still does have production in the UK and is also well known for sponsoring Manchester City between 1989 and 1999, still one of the longest shirt deals in UK football history. The company will continue to use the Wrexham factory to run a recycling scheme for printer cartridges as well as to make other office technology. UK boss Phil Jones said the typewriter still held 'a special place in the hearts' of members of the public. He said: 'Because of this, and the typewriter\u2019s importance in the history of business communication, we felt that giving it a home at the Science Museum would be a fitting tribute.' Typewriters were first mass produced by the Remington company in the 1870s. The Science Museum\u2019s assistant curator of technologies and engineering, Rachel Boon, said staff were excited to add the item 'to our rich collection of typewriters' which numbers more than 200. She said: 'This model will enable us to tell the story of how technology has evolved in accordance with our communication needs.' The first known typewriter was invented in the US in 1830 by William Burt. But typewriters did not become a commercial success until the 1870s when inventors Christopher Sholes - who also invented the Qwerty keyboard - and Carlos Glidden made a deal with the Remington company to mass produce their machines. The first recorded idea for a typewriter is dated 1714 when an Englishman called Henry Mill patented his idea for \"an artificial machine or method for the impressing or transcribing of letters singly or progressively one after another.\" However, it wasn't until 1808 that Italian Pellegrino Turri built the first working machine of its kind. Turri made the typewriter for his friend Countess Carolina Fantoni da Fivizzano, a story which was the basis of a novel by Carey Wallace published in 2010. It wasn't until 1870 when Danish pastor Rasmus Malling-Hansen invented his 'writing ball,' that production of typewriter-like machines began on an industrial level. Typewriters as we know them now started to circulate after the introduction in 1874 of the Sholes & Glidden Type Writer in the USA. This machine brought in the QWERTY keyboard, and was designed by Milwaukee journalist, poet, and part-time inventor Christopher L Sholes. The QWERTY keyboard was designed to solve problems during printing, separating frequently-used pairs of type-bars so that the type-bars would not clash and get stuck at the printing point. The Sholes and Glidden looked very like a sewing machine and had limited success on the market. The Remington later became the commercial leaders in typewriters and is the basis of all such machines since. It was the Underwood typewriter that captured the market place for the coming decades. By the 1920's all brands were an imitation of the Underwood, which boasted frontstroke, QWERTY, typebar machines printing through a ribbon, and the\u00a0 one shift key and four banks of keys.",

        "article": "LONDON, England -- A huge crowd gathered in London, UK on Friday for a mass \"moonwalk\" -- paying tribute to Michael Jackson by dancing to his most iconic songs and replicating his famous walk. Two young fans who say Michael Jackson meant a lot to them donned self-made T-shirts at the event in London. The horde of people gathered on the streets outside Liverpool Street train station, one of the city's major transport hubs, and burst out into cheers, chants and dances to the tunes of \"Billie Jean,\" \"Bad\" and \"Thriller.\" Life-long Jackson fan Milo Yiannopoulos organized the moonwalk, the singer's trademark backwards shuffle, by sending messages via Twitter and Facebook. His messages went \"viral\" --spreading like wildfire around the Internet -- as the number of people wanting to join his impromptu \"flash mob\" event far exceeded his expectations: . \"I don't know what I've unleashed here,\" Yiannopoulos, who said he doesn't even know how to moonwalk, told CNN. He came up with the ideas \"because of all of the stuff people are saying about Michael Jackson -- surgeries, molestation etc. -- I wanted to do something to remind people how great he really is and remind them of his music.\" But those who were there did not seem to need much reminding of Jackson's greatness. \"He is the biggest idol in my life. Unfortunately, I did not grow up with all his best hits, but he has been so important for me. I am very sad,\" said 13-year-old Paul Graham, who wore a self-made Michael Jackson \"Rest in Peace\" T-shirt. See images of Jackson fans at the moonwalk event \u00bb . Another of the many young fans there was 17-year-old George Webster, who spontaneously performed a perfect Michael Jackson dance routine for a cheering audience. He told CNN: \"This is a celebration. We are here to remember Michael Jackson's best moments.\" And the laughing crowd did indeed seem to be celebrating, rather than mourning: . Hanging off lampposts and standing atop telephone booths, people were brandishing everything from white paper gloves to black hats and face masks. Watch video of the crowd singing to Billie Jean \u00bb . British television presenter Gail Porter was also at the tribute: \"As soon as I saw it on Twitter, I thought 'let's go and have a dance',\" she told CNN while twittering away on her cell phone. The gathering started off to a rocky start, as the short notice had left London city police unsure about how to handle it and what to expect. They were overheard telling organizer Yiannopoulos that they would not allow him to do the moonwalk outside the station and that he had to limit his gathering to 300 people. Eventually the crowd was allowed to gather outside, attracting many more tourists, commuters and passers-by to join in the event. \"I want to thank the police for being so cool,\" Yiannopoulos told the audience. \"You guys are great, let's continue dancing.\" More tributes are now expected to take place around the world and Austria has already replicated London's moonwalk event with their own on Friday.",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenage girl from Houston, who told her parents she was spending the night with a friend, was found with a 31-year-old man she had met online. The girl, who has not been named, was spotted with Robert Tyler Patrick, when police pulled their car over in the early hours of Saturday. Patrick claimed to be taking the girl to stay with family in San Antonio, but . the teenager told police she was going to Patrick's apartment, after meeting him on social network, Whisper. Stopped: Robert Tyler Patrick has been charged with soliciting a minor after traffic police found him with a 16-year-old girl . Several bags and a suitcase belonging to the girl were found in the car, and Patrick claimed he was helping the teenager because she had been thrown out of home. But, when police called the girl's parents, they told officers their daughter hadn't been thrown out and that they believed she was staying with a friend. They also said they were unaware their daughter had been seeing Patrick, who is nearly twice her age. Patrick had been pulled over by police in Tomball because he had an expired registration sticker. He later admitted he had been having an 'inappropriate relationship' with the teenager, the Houston Chronicle reported. The teenager claimed they had met through the social networking app Whisper, which allows users to anonymously post messages and pictures, and also send private messages. A police statement sent to Mail Online states that the teenager told police the pair had communicated online, sharing messages and pictures, for a few days before agreeing to meet in person. On the day police stopped them, the girl said she had arranged to go to Patrick's apartment. Claims: Patrick is accused of pretending to be a 17-year-old boy when the pair chatted on the Whisper App . Patrick allegedly later told police he and the teenager had sent explicit pictures to each other. Court documents allege that he had pretended to be 17 during online conversations with the teenager. Patrick was charged with solicitation of a minor and was released on $10,000 bond. He is next due in court on April 24. The 31-year-old could face further . charges after detectives finish their investigation of cell phones and . computers that were taken from the pair.",

        "article": "By . Natalie Pinkham . PUBLISHED: . 20:55 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 08:08 EST, 2 March 2014 . I first met Mirela when she was three years old. She had big brown eyes, a mop of brown hair, skinny arms and legs and a bloated belly. Home \u2013 if you could call it that \u2013 was a decaying orphanage for 300 children in the Romanian city of Slatina, three hours west of Bucharest. She had nothing. No toys, no possessions. Even her clothes were rotated with the other orphans. Yet, despite the deprivation, Mirela was a cheeky little thing who made a beeline for me every playtime. And when I left \u2013 after spending the summer of 1999 as a 20-year-old volunteer at the orphanage \u2013 I\u2019d often think of her. Brighter future: Orphaned Romanian teenager Mirela in her new bedroom with racing presenter Natalie Pinkham, who raised the money to find a home for Mirela and her siblings . Over the years, it was easier to imagine she\u2019d been adopted and\u00a0 was safe and happy, so that\u2019s what\u00a0 I did. But deep down I knew that was unlikely. For a while, the West did everything it could to help the orphans of Nicolae Ceausescu\u2019s dictatorship. Inevitably, though, the world moves on. People\u2019s attention shifted elsewhere, but what of Mirela? Three years ago I decided to go back to Romania to find out. All I had was a photo. I didn\u2019t even know her surname. It took me weeks to find her. I searched the sewers of Bucharest where many homeless orphans seek shelter and spoke to prostitutes who had been in state care. I discovered her in Slatina in a cramped two-bedroom flat with ten other children. She was no longer\u00a0 a toddler but a severely disturbed 13-year-old. Years of neglect and being tied to a radiator \u2013 that\u2019s how we found her \u2013 had done their worst. According to the child psychiatrist Professor Michael Rutter, the brain shrinks when a person goes without love. So it was with Mirela. She couldn\u2019t talk or interact and hit\u00a0 herself constantly. It was so sad to look into her eyes. They were dead. What had she\u00a0 seen and experienced over the past\u00a0 decade? She was also painfully thin and couldn\u2019t walk very well. Orphaned: Mirela aged three, seen in a picture taken by Natalie while she was a volunteer at the orphanage, was a happy toddler with a bleak future . I couldn\u2019t abandon her again. This time I vowed I would find Mirela\u00a0 a home, somewhere she would\u00a0 be safe. In truth, I had absolutely\u00a0 no idea how I was going to do this, but shortly afterwards I was hosting a charity event when I met someone from Hope and Homes,\u00a0 an incredible organisation that is working to close all children\u2019s institutions worldwide. I told them I wanted to build a house for Mirela. They set up a sub fund for her and helped me find a plot of land and get planning permission. They also gave me the credibility of working with experts who are leaders in their field. Then there was the small matter of finding \u00a3200,000. So began more than two years of constant fundraising. I held an event at the House of Commons with the MP Caroline Nokes and another at the Mayfair nightclub Mahiki. I climbed ten peaks in ten hours, launched a Twitter campaign and held online auctions. When I married my husband, Owain Walbyoff, a TV executive, in 2012, we sold the wedding pictures to Hello! and put the fee towards Mirela\u2019s fund. At one time I found it hard to reconcile my job as Sky\u2019s Formula 1 pit lane reporter with Mirela. Seeing all the wealth was so far removed from what I was seeing in the children\u2019s projects I was by then beginning to visit. Yet, in a way, it\u2019s been the home that F1 built. Racing forward: Natalie took help from her friends in the F1 world to raise money . A female racing driver called Alice . Powell organised a karting day and my fellow Sky Formula 1 presenters . pitched up. McLaren and Red Bull sent their pit crews down and Jenson . Button gave me memorabilia for an auction. Everyone says that F1\u2019s an . elitist sport but these people didn\u2019t owe me anything, they just wanted . to help. There were also . bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. The authorities said they would . facilitate my \u2018adoption\u2019 of Mirela but on the condition that I took her . siblings \u2013 which I\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 plus eight other children I . didn\u2019t know. A couple of them were like feral animals and so . institutionalised it scared me being in the same room with them. It wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d envisaged it. I have made a documentary for Channel 5, A Home For Mirela, and in all honesty some scenes are quite disturbing. This isn\u2019t the nice happy ending of opening this cosy little home and having kids running around laughing. I admit I found it quite hard to take and there were a few reflective nights until I pulled myself together. As Hope and Homes has taught me, these are exactly the sort of children we should be helping. The ones who aren\u2019t pretty to look at, the last ten per cent that nobody wants. Last December, we moved in. Mirela supposedly understands little of her surroundings, but the first moment we walked in her face changed. She pulled off her coat and started running around touching things, smelling things. I had wanted Mirela to be socialised around \u2018normal\u2019 kids so she could mimic behaviour, raise her game and start communicating. But experts believe the environment she is in \u2013 with space, a garden, her own possessions \u2013 will help build a sense of identity she\u2019s never had. She has her own room, her own wardrobe covered in stickers and toys and clothes donated by friends in England. At the end of the trip, when I said goodbye to Mirela, she reached out, hugged me and began stroking my face, something she has never done before. I have no doubt she understands a lot more than we think. It was an end and a beginning. The Romanian authorities have agreed to fund the home and I will continue to raise money to safeguard its future. This is where we start to try to reverse some of her symptoms and also gain a better understanding of the impact of institutionalisation. If Mirela has taught me one thing it\u2019s that we have a moral duty to look after these children, to not presume that they can cope without love. Mirela wasn\u2019t born this way. And while I\u2019m happy we\u2019ve been able to build this home and I\u2019m so thankful for all the support, there is also a\u00a0 profound sense of sadness. I genuinely feel that had I intervened sooner, Mirela wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. And nor would many more like her. The Lost Orphan: A Home\u00a0 For Mirela is on Channel 5\u00a0 at 7pm on Wednesday.",

        "article": "By . Sarah Michael . When David Burder saw a two-man V8 chainsaw on display in New Zealand a few years ago his first thought was: 'I can make a better one'. So the self-confessed rev-head from Whitlands in rural northeast Victoria built his own one-man chainsaw, powered by a V8 engine salvaged from a 1979 Holden Commodore. Mr Burder, 56, is putting his 330kg monster chainsaw on show at the Fieldays agricultural technology expo in Hamilton, New Zealand this week. Scroll down for video . David Burder, from Whitlands in rural northeast Victoria, built a 330kg V8 chainsaw . The chainsaw is on display at the Fieldays agricultural technology expo in Hamilton, New Zealand . His creation is so powerful it can cut through a 600mm diameter hardwood log in 2.5 seconds. Mr Burder, who owns a wood splitter business in Whitlands, spent a year building the chainsaw in his spare time just for fun. 'I'm a bit of a V8 nut, a rev-head you might say,' he told MailOnline. 'It's just a great toy. My motto is \"He who has best toy wins\". Blokes will understand.' The 56-year-old self-confessed rev-head spent a year building the chainsaw in his spare time just for fun . The chainsaw is so powerful it can cut through a 600mm diameter hardwood log in 2.5 seconds . Engine: 1979 Holden 253ci (4.2L) V8Carburetor: Four-barrel QuadrajetIgnition: ElectronicExhausts:\u00a0 Four into one three-inch collectorsGearbox: 1.1 ratio right angle driveHarvester bar: 43 inchHarvester chain: 3/4 pitchWeight: 330kgSize: 2.6m length x .9m width x 1.5m heightFuel: 91 octane petrol . Most of the components were designed and made by Mr Burder or sourced through suppliers he uses for his business. The most difficult part was finding a suitable gearbox, which he eventually imported specially from Germany. Mr Burder said he had never seen anyone else make a one-man V8 chainsaw, and that his was safer than the two-man machines that are popular in the US. 'It's on a couple of little wheels so you can wheel it round and one person can use it quite safely,' he said. 'If you see the one Americans use, two people have got to pick them up and drop them on the log. If you tripped over all hell could break loose.' The machine is powered by a V8 engine salvaged from a 1979 Holden Commodore . Mr Burder's son Jared, 25, pictured using the one-man V8 chainsaw . The Fieldays expo has over 900 exhibitions but Mr Burder said his show always draws a big audience. 'We get an enormous crowd hanging around and it makes a lot of sawdust,' he said. 'They're just mind-boggled. They sit there with their minds open and a big grin on their face.' A YouTube video of his chainsaw on display has received almost 1.5 million views since it was posted in October last year.

        "article": "One of the last people to see Lord Lucan has claimed that the missing peer was driven to kill after a pet kitten he bought for his children had its throat cut and was posted through his letter box. George Weiss  said that Lucan, who vanished in 1974,\u00a0had bought the kitten from Harrods and sent it to his estranged wife Veronica and their children at their home in London's Belgravia. However, when Lucan discovered the animal had been posted back through his letter box with its throat cut, it pushed him into attacking Lady Lucan and killing his children's nanny Sandra Rivett, according to Mr Weiss. Friend: George Weiss (left), one of the last people to see Lord Lucan (right), claims that the missing peer was driven to kill after a pet kitten he bought for his children had its throat cut and was posted through his letter box . 'He saw no way back into family life and the life of his children. It tipped him over the edge and it made him decide to uncreate his wife,' Mr Weiss, now 74, told the Daily Mirror's David Collins. Mr Weiss had seen Lucan at the Clermont Club in Mayfair on November 6, 1974 - the day before the murder - and the pair had played backgammon. He said Lucan, who was facing heavy gambling losses at the time, hardly spoke, and had been acting strangely when he saw him at the club, and when he asked what was the matter, Lucan had replied nothing was wrong. Theory: It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Sandra Rivett (left) for his wife Veronica (right) and hit her with lead piping.\u00a0Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant . Couple: Lord and Lady Lucan had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street . Victim: Mrs Rivett's body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house . 'And seeing him sitting across from me on our usual backgammon table the day before the murder is an image that has stayed with me for the last 40 years,' said Mr Weiss, who was also friends with\u00a0the late comedian Peter Cook and Charles Saatchi. 'I believe he was plotting his wife\u2019s murder. He was in a world of his own, playing as if he were on autopilot.' Mr Weiss then asked another friend, financier Stephen Raphael, if he knew why Lucan seemed so distant. Venue:\u00a0Mr Weiss had seen Lucan at the Clermont Club in Mayfair on November 6, 1974 - the day before the murder - and the pair had played backgammon . Suspicions: Mr Weiss (pictured) says he believes Lucan was plotting his wife's murder while he at the club . Family: Mr Weiss says the cat had been purchased by Lucan for his three children, pictured with their mother the month after their father's disappearance . He said Mr Raphael then told him that Lucan had bought the kitten for his children to cheer them up during the\u00a0acrimonious separation from Lady Lucan and their bitter custody battle. The couple had married in 1963 and had three children together, but the marriage collapsed in 1972 and he moved put of the family home and into a house on a neighbouring street. Mr Weiss said Lucan had taken the cat to the family home, but just hours later it was posted through his letter box  with its throat cut. Wife: Lady Lucan, pictured earlier this year, believes her husband took his own life after the crime . Mr Weiss said Lucan had been at the Clermont from 4.30pm until 7.30pm when he left for a\u00a0restaurant. It was the last time he ever saw him. The next day, November 7, 1974, Mrs Rivett's murder and Lucan's subsequent disappearance would spark Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt. It is believed that Lucan, a professional gambler, mistook Mrs Rivett for his wife and hit her with lead piping. Her body was found hidden in an old U.S. mail sack in the basement of the house. Lady Lucan was also attacked and later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation he telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and was never seen again. The Corsair was later found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for his arrest was issued a few days later and in his absence, the inquest into Mrs Rivett's death named him as her murderer - the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court was allowed to do so. Lucan, who would  be celebrating his 80th birthday next month, was never seen again.\u00a0In 1999 his family was granted probate over his estate, although no death certificate was issued. However, there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa as the mystery continues to capture the public's imagination. His half-brother Hugh Bingham said last year that Lucan died in 2004 and is buried in Africa, while his son George Bingham has said that he believes his father drowned in the English channel. His youngest daughter,\u00a0Lady Camilla Bloch QC, who was four at the time of the murder, said last year that\u00a0it was important to remember that her father had never stood trial and insisted that evidence against him was \u2018circumstantial\u2019. Lady Lucan, now 76, has said she is bored with the constant claims that her husband might still be alive and of the numerous unconfirmed sightings of him. She is adamant her husband took his own life shortly after the crime and that she had long ago learned to forgive him.",

        "article": "Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal will try to kickstart his club\u2019s season without new signings Marcos Rojo and Ander Herrera at Sunderland on Sunday. United need a victory at the Stadium of Light to lift the gloom surrounding the club after the 2-1 home defeat by Swansea City on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Marcos Rojo take the Ice Bucket Challenge . Admission: Van Gaal (right) revealed that new signing Rojo (left) will not be available for Sunday's game . New Arrival: Speaking for the first time since his unveiling as a United player, Rojo said he was excited to join . But it emerged last night that Argentina international Rojo has not yet had his work permit granted after his midweek \u00a316million move from Sporting Lisbon and Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera suffered an ankle injury in training. \u2018We have seven injuries, which is a lot,\u2019 Van Gaal said: \u2018In my career as a trainer, I have never had seven injuries before. Last game it was nine, so we are progressing. \u2018I have four midfielders missing: Herrera, (Marouane) Fellaini, (Jesse) Lingard and (Michael) Carrick. So it\u2019s a little bit thin in midfield. \u2018Herrera (was hurt) yesterday in training but it is too early to make a scan. Rojo is fit, but we still have to arrange the work permit.\u2019 Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page here. Ready: The Argentina defender can play on the left or in the centre, but is not eligible to start on Sunday . Patient: United fans will have to wait a little longer to get their first sight of Rojo in action for the club . Rojo\u2019s paperwork will be a formality, given that he is a full Argentina international. He may now make his debut at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday. Van Gaal, meanwhile, warns United\u2019s fans not to expect the Premier League title this season. \u2018It is not a question of being champion,\u2019 he said. \u2018We have to build a team, and that process takes maybe longer. \u2018The fans need to believe, like chief executive Ed Woodward and the Glazers, because we need the fans. \u2018It was amazing after our loss against Swansea, that the fans were applauding me. I never had that experience before \u2014 nowhere.\u2019",

        "article": "Real Madrid became the first club to score 1000 goals in European competition on Tuesday night with their 5-1 win over Basle. It was Karim Benzema  who got the 1000th goal, joining an illustrious list of some of the club\u2019s most famous marksmen\u2026 and a Tottenham striker. Roberto Soldado scored the club\u2019s 800th goal in Europe from a David Beckham cross against Olympiacos in 2005, six years before Cristiano Ronaldo got goal number 900 in 2011 in a 2-0 win over Lyon. Before Soldado, it was Raul who scored goal number 700 on his way to registering 71 Champions League goals \u2013 a total that has him as the competition\u2019s all-time top scorer, three ahead of Ronaldo. Karim Benzema smashes in Real Madrid's 1000th goal in European football off the underside of the bar . The prolific French striker celebrates the scoring the landmark goal at the Bernabeu on Tuesday . Robert Soldado scored Real's 800th goal in European competition in 2005 but didn't make the grade at Madrid . The Spanish striker endured a torrid first season at Tottenham, and has lost his place in the side . Fernando Hierro, who is now Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s assistant, got goal number 600 in a 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen in 1998. Sebastian Losada got goal number 500 in 1990 in a 6-0 win over Odense. Real were in the Uefa Cup in 1984 when they beat FC Wacker Innsbruck on their way to beating Videoton in the final and Santillana scored goal number 400 for them. Ten years earlier one of Spain\u2019s greatest ever midfielders Pirri scored goal number 300 in the Cup Winners Cup, and nine years before that the \u2018Galloping Major\u2019 Ferenc Puskas got the club's 200th European strike in a 5-1 over Odense. Cristiano Ronaldo is delighted after grabbing Real Madrid's 900th goal in European competitions .

The legendary Alfredo di Stefano (right) scored the European century goal for Los Blancos' - against Barcelona in 1960 . Ferenc Puskas, another of Real's greatest ever players, scored European goal number 200\u00a0in 1965 . Fittingly the man who marked up Real\u2019s first century was the late, great Alfredo Di Stefano who scored against Barcelona in the European Cup in 1960. Miguel Munoz has the honour of scoring Los Blancos' first ever European goal, when he put Real ahead in an away match at Swiss side Servette in October 1955. He then went on to manage the Spanish giants to nine La Liga titles. It is Barcelona  who are closest to catching Real Madrid\u2019s all-time haul in European competitions, with 980 goals, followed by Bayern Munich with 799 and Juventus with 736.

        "article": "By . Chris Parsons . PUBLISHED: . 06:03 EST, 4 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:36 EST, 4 April 2012 . Affair: Married police officer David McCann reportedly had sex with his mistress 36 times while on duty . A veteran police officer has been suspended after reportedly having sex with his 'booty call' mistress 36 times while he was on duty. Melissa Kingfield claimed she had regular liaisons with married David McCann as his 'dinner break booty call' and even recorded all their trysts in a personal journal. McCann, 42, a veteran officer with Sunrise Police Department, Broward, Florida, has since been suspended for 200 hours after Kingfield, 30, gave her detailed sex spreadsheet to police. Her diary reveals how the pair shared 'nooner sex' (sex at midday), as well as 'quality time/sex' while McCann was on duty. The pair are said to have met in April 2009, according to an investigator's report, but their romance ended last summer. According . to the Sun Sentinel, Lt William Glennon, an Internal Affairs . investigator, said McCann 'used his position as a police officer ... to . calculatingly and stealthily have a consensual affair with Melissa . Kingfield while on duty.' In a statement made last summer, Kingfield is said to have told Glennon: 'I was dinner break booty call.' She told the Sun Sentinel: ''I felt . like I was blinded by my love for him and I trusted all his excuses. I . felt like I was really taken advantage of. 'I felt conned, manipulated, used. And for what purpose, I may never know.' McCann and Kingfield had a two-year affair lasting from May 2009 until June last year, according to her sex spreadsheet. Sex spreadsheet: Kingfield provided detailed references of all her sexual encounters with McCann . The pair are said to have met at a crime watch meeting in April 2009, where McCann told Kingfield he was having marital problems. Just days after they met, McCann is said to have told Kingfield she was 'perfect and everything he had been searching for his whole life'. The last entry in her journal reads: 'Hugging \u2014 No sex still on a break/He says next time we're together we'll have a baby.' The officer, who has worked for Sunrise Police for 13 years, has since insisted he did not have sex with Kingfield while he was working. Investigation: Officials are now looking into the claims that Sunrise Police officer McCann had sex with his mistress while on duty . McCann has since said he 'totally cut off' Kingfield by changing his phone number and blocking her emails. Investigator Mr Glennon cross-referenced her diary against McCann's time card to confirm whether the liaisons happened while he was on duty. However, her account has been dismissed byUnion attorney Robert Buschel as the work of a 'scorned woman intent on revenge.' Buschel told the Sun Sentinel: 'She is a scorned woman and this is a campaign to punish him. 'What kind of woman keeps track of her sexual activities and then turns it in to get a guy in trouble?' Kingfield revealed the affair ended up being a 'nightmare' for her, adding that since their relationship finished 'just the sight of a police car makes me sick and scared'.",

        "article": "Rory McIlroy received plenty of criticism when he switched club manufacturers almost two years ago and he has now conceded that it took nearly 12 months to feel totally at ease with his new equipment. The Northern Irishman was flying high at the top of the world rankings when he signed a 10-year contract with Nike in January 2013 that, according to media reports, was worth $250 million. A host of fellow golfers and media pundits lined up to tell McIlroy he was taking a gamble with his career and he went through a torrid time before ending a 12-month title drought by landing the Australian Open crown at the end of the year. Rory McIlroy celebrates after winning the US PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in August . McIlroy poses with the European Tour's Race to Dubai trophy in Dubai in November . McIlroy has not looked back since and an outstanding 2014 season yielded two major triumphs, a World Golf Championship win, victory in the European Tour's flagship event, a memorable Ryder Cup display and a return to the no. 1 spot in the rankings. 'The Australian win at the end of a very lean 2013 was a welcome bit of form,' the 25-year-old said. 'It was the coming together of some hard work on many aspects of my game and becoming completely comfortable with the club changes I'd made. 'I then had the confidence to get the job done. I'd say it was worth the wait to get things properly in place. 'The major wins were really a continuation of that process. And, of course, hugely important, satisfying and evidence that I could win majors when I had to dig deep, rather than by comfortable margins,' said McIlroy who has been voted the 2014 Reuters Sportsman of the Year. 'But don't get me wrong. I've nothing against a comfortable margin.' McIlroy's first two major triumphs, in the 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 U.S. PGA Championship, were both runaway eight-shot victories. McIlroy (left) celebrates Euope's Ryder Cup victory alongside team-mate Sergio Garcia . McIlroy also won the PGA Championship at Wentworth in 2014, the European Tour's flagship event . His third and fourth major wins, achieved this year, were much tighter affairs. He won the British Open at Hoylake by two strokes in July and had only one shot to spare when he lifted his second U.S. PGA Championship trophy, in Kentucky in August. McIlroy also had a stellar season in 2012, winning five times around the world, but believes he is a much more mature player these days. 'Two years on tour is quite a long time, even (or especially) as a 25-year-old,' he explained. 'I also think my game and mental approach are in many ways linked. 'With my swing, clubs and fitness in place, I feel confident enough to go out and win. 'Perhaps a lot of the maturity is just an extended learning curve, with each experience, good or bad, another lesson in patience, course management and knowing when, or when not, to take a risk.' McIlroy gave an exemplary exhibition of course management during Europe's victory over the United States in Scotland in September. Pitting his wits against an in-form Rickie Fowler in the final-day singles at Gleneagles, he simply blew the American away with a performance that showed just why he is the world no. 1. McIlroy reeled off four birdies and an eagle in a stunning six-hole start and went on to record a 5 & 4 demolition job on a dazed Fowler. McIlroy poses with his two major trophies, the US PGA Championship and The Open (right) 'That was really down to a confidence thing,' said the Northern Irishman. 'I'd been playing really well, my swing was in great shape and I felt I knew what I needed to do to get a win on the board -- get off to a fast start. 'The early birdies that day came as a result of some excellent driving, which effectively took any trouble out of the equation on the opening holes and allowed me relatively easy approaches. 'I thought that if I was well under par by the turn I would be difficult to catch.' The quality of McIlroy's golf this year has helped him establish a sizeable lead over closest pursuers Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and Bubba Watson and he will certainly be difficult to catch at the top of the rankings in 2015.",

The internet giant is working on a program to prove to companies who advertise on its web pages that their money is persuading customers to make physical purchases. The software could allow Google to charge more for advertisements and make even more money. Watch what you shop! The internet giant is working on software so it can to prove to companies who advertise on its web pages that their money is persuading customers to make physical purchases . But it will likely raise fresh concerns over privacy with Google, which has a chequered history of handling its users data. The program works with AdWords, Google\u2019s biggest advertising software, which lets companies put links next to search results. Google is paid every time somebody clicks through and goes to the company\u2019s website. The software works by sending an anonymous \u2018click ID\u2019 to the advertiser when somebody clicks on an advert. The person is identified by the advertiser because they will have cookies installed on the user\u2019s computer. When . that person buys something in a bricks and mortar store, the retailer is . able to link them back to their computer using data gleaned from the . cookie. The cookie is then matched up with the \u2018click ID\u2019, thus telling them how effective their advertising with Google was. Companies . who advertise with Google will be able to see the results in a new . column on their version of the programme which shows in-store sales . fuelled by Internet advertising, the Wall St Journal reported. It remains unclear exactly how this will be implemented. The program, which was first reported by the Wall St Journal, works with AdWords, Google\u2019s biggest advertising software, which lets companies put links next to search results. Google is paid each time a surfer clicks on an advert and goes to the retailer\u2019s website. The software works by sending an anonymous \u2018click ID\u2019 to the advertiser when somebody clicks on an advert. The person is identified by the advertiser because they will have cookies installed on the user\u2019s computer. When that customer buys something in a walk-in store, the retailer is able to link them back to their computer using data gleaned from the cookie. The cookie is then matched up with the \u2018click ID\u2019, thus telling a shop how effective their advertising with Google was. It remains unclear exactly how this will be implemented. Companies who advertise with Google will be able to see the results in a new column on their version of the programme which shows in-store sales fuelled by internet advertising, the Wall St Journal reported. So far, six American companies are taking part in the trial, but that will likely expand if it is a success. The official title of the programme is In-Store Attribution Transaction Reporting in AdWords, . Google made $50.5 billion revenue last year, almost half of an industry which coins in $117 billion a year. When a person buys something in an online store, the retailer is able to link them back to their computer using data gleaned from the cookie. The cookie is then re-matched up with the 'click ID', telling them how effective their advertising with Google was . It also has a stranglehold over the expanding market in Internet searches - two out of every three U.S. web trawls are conducted through Google, with its share rising to 19 out of 20 in Europe. The giant has sometimes overstepped the mark and in 2011 agreed to pay $500 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice investigation. Google had been accused of allowing Canadian drug companies to advertise on U.S. web pages, meaning drugs not authorised for America were being sold there. Rivals such as Microsoft have long complained it impedes competition by blocking rival products from coming up near the top of its searches, an allegation Google has denied. In Britain, Google caused outrage when with its Streetview service in which cars with 360 degree cameras drove around streets filming people\u2019s homes. It later emerged that for the three years Google was filming it was also collecting data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks. After the issue caused a huge row in Germany, Google was forced to stop filming for Streetview there. Residents in the village of Broughton in Cambridgeshire also took matters into their own hands when they saw a Google Street View car by forming a human chain to block its path. MailOnline has contacted Google for comment. A spokesman told the Wall St Journal that Google never knows the identity of the user. He said: \u2018We are running a number of tests to help clients use their own sales data to measure how their search campaigns impact sales\u2019.",

        "article": "By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . The Washington Post is ending 80 years of being led by the Graham family with the departure of Publisher Katharine Weymouth. The newspaper said Tuesday that Weymouth, the granddaughter of longtime Washington Post Co. CEO Katharine Graham, is stepping down. She will be replaced by Frederick Ryan, who previously ran the political website and newspaper Politico. Weymouth announced Tuesday that she will leave the Post after serving for 17 years in various roles. She has been publisher for seven years. New publisher: Frederick Ryan, seen in this 2012 file photo, will become publisher of The Washington Post starting October 1 . 'This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post,' she said in a statement. She also described her successor as 'a seasoned and well-respected executive with a track record of success at the helm of Politico and Allbritton Communications. He knows Washington, and he knows media. Fred is excited to take the helm and to meet all of you.' Weymer's statement said Ryan will become publisher October 1, though she revealed 'I will remain available as an advisor to him and to The Post through the end of the year.' The change follows the sale of the publication last year to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million. On Tuesday, Bezos announced the appointment of Ryan as the new publisher. Ryan had served as president and CEO of Politico since its inception in 2007. In the 1980s, Ryan was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. In a statement, Ryan called The Post a 'crown jewel' of journalistic values. Stepping down: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, left, bought The Washington Post for $250 million last year. Katherine Weymouth, right, is stepping down as publisher but has said she will be an adviser to help with the leadership transitoin . The Washington Post reported that Ryan, while speaking to the paper's newsroom, only said of his new job 'I decided I\u2019m not going to get into the play-by-play. But I will say, I\u2019ve known Jeff for a while. He is passionate about The Post and about journalism and about the premier role The Post has played and can play going forward. 'And we had a lot of exciting conversations about opportunities that are available in media today, challenges of course, innovative ways forward. And I was honored that he selected me to take on this role. '[Ryan] has never asked us to do or not do a story,' Bill Lord, Ryan's colleague at Albritton Communications, told The Post. 'He\u2019s never tried to influence the news one way or another.' Politico, which is based in Arlington, Va., was launched by two former Washington Post reporters, John Harris and Jim VandeHei, in January 2007. It is known for hard-hitting, sometimes irreverent reporting on campaigns, rhetoric and scandal, and is one of The Washington Post's strongest competitors. Weymouth's great-grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought the Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933. Meyer's daughter, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through some of its most important stories, including the Watergate scandal.",

A drunk driver forced terrified motorists out of his way when he drove into on-coming traffic for three miles around a city centre the wrong way. John Rixon, 31, had smoked cannabis and was nearly twice over the limit when he set off in his silver Audi to drive 25 miles home at midnight after visiting a friend. But he found himself on the gyratory system in Bristol city centre\u00a0 - heading the wrong way. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dangerous: CCTV footage shows Rixon driving around Bristol city centre the wrong way . Failed to spot the sign: Rixon going the wrong way around St James Barton Roundabout . CCTV operators alerted police after Rixon ignored warnings from other motorists and drove on until he found himself in a dead end blocked by bollards. He then reversed and went back onto the city centre system, still on the wrong side of the road, and heading straight towards oncoming drivers. His 15 minutes of mayhem ended when he crashed into a taxi driver and another motorist driving the wrong way around a roundabout. Rixon abandoned his car and tried to run away but he was rugby-tackled to the ground by a policeman. Rixon captured on Rupert Street in Bristol. The 31-year-old had been drinking and smoking cannabis . Accident waiting to happen: Rixon captured on Baldwin Street. CCTV operators alerted police after the driver ignored warnings from motorists . Tests found he had 62 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of breath. The limit is 35. Rixon, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and drink-driving. He escaped prison with a suspended sentence when a judge heard he was a man of good character with not even a parking ticket to his name. Richard Smith QC, sitting at Bristol Crown Court, sentenced him to 12 months behind bars suspended for two years. He told Rixon: 'It was a matter of good fortune that you did not cause greater damage or greater injury. The car on Nelson Street. Tests found Rixon had 62 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of breath.

'However, you are a man of good character, you have no previous convictions, you have always been employed and you have very good qualities. 'It was an unpleasant episode, completely out of character - a catastrophic error.' David Scutt, defending, said: 'He is almost 32. He has never been in trouble and tells me he has never even had a parking ticket. 'It was wholly out of character. This is a well-educated man and a hard-working man.' Mr Scutt said his remorseful client made a 'catastrophic error' to drive after visiting a friend in June. He added that Rixon was trying to tackle alcohol addiction. Rixon was banned from driving for three years and ordered to pass an extended driving test before returning to the road. He was also made the subject of 12 months\u2019 supervision and told to take an impaired drivers\u2019 course.",

But one pet-owner was perhaps hoping to give any burglars an extra fright by dressing their Dogue de Bordeaux up as a lion. In two pictures posted on Twitter, the animal can be seen proudly standing guard by his front gate, before looking confused while sitting on a bed. Scroll down for video . Pride of the pack: A Dogue de Bordeaux wearing a lion's mane costume stands guard outside a house . King of beasts: The confused canine sits on a bed while wearing the mane, which can be bought online for \u00a35 . The image was posted online by user @cuteoverloads along with the caption: 'Ordered a lion off eBay & they sent me this.' It is not the first time that a dog owner has attempted to disguise their faithful friend as a lion. In August last year a Chinese zoo was mocked online after trying to pass off a hairy dog as the king of beasts after removing the exotic animal from its enclosure. The tourist attraction also placed a mongrel dog in the leopard enclosure, and exchanged their wolf for a white dog breed. Fearsome: The pet owner may have been hoping to scare off intruders by dressing their pet up as a lion . Dog in disguise: A Chinese zoo was caught attempting to disguise this hairy Tibetan mastiff as a lion last year . While the zoo groomed their animals in an attempt to make them appear wild, the owner of this Dogue de Bordeaux appears to have used a costume. Fancy dress lion manes, which are designed to fit both cats and dogs, are widely available online and cost around \u00a35. Do you have any pictures of your pet dressed up in fancy-dress? We'd love to hear from you. Please send your pictures to chris.pleasance@mailonline.co.uk .",

        "article": "Payerne, Switzerland (CNN) -- With the wingspan of a jumbo jet and a scooter-sized engine, the Solar Impulse is a one of a kind. Thanks to nearly 12,000 solar cells and four electrically-powered propellers, it's the first aircraft in the world that can fly without any fuel -- day or night. The 63-meter wide, 1,600 kilogram plane is already a record breaker, staying in the air for 26 unbroken hours in 2010. But it's about more than just flying, says pilot Andre Borschberg. \"We want to show what can be done with these technologies,\" Borschberg said. \"We can keep our quality of life but reduce our energy consumptions, reduce our dependency on oil and nuclear energy.\" The idea for Solar Impulse came from Bertrand Piccard, the first man to travel non-stop around the world in a balloon. \"We almost failed (because of) lack of fuel,\" Piccard said of his epic journey back in 1999. \"At that moment, I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all. And that's how the vision of solar impulse was born,\" he said. But it wasn't until he met Borschberg seven years ago that he began to fulfill that promise. With a budget of $134 million at their disposal, the Solar Impulse team have the sponsors and the support to realize their goal of flying around the world without fuel in 2014 -- a first in aviation history. \"Everything we do is new. Each time it's a pioneering step,\" Piccard said. \"When the Wright Brothers did that first flight in 1903, it took 25 years for Charles Lindbergh to cross the Atlantic. He did it alone. (It then took) another 25 years to have 100 passengers flying over the Atlantic.\" With fair winds behind them, Piccard and Borschberg are confident that the future of solar flying is bright and that Solar Impulse will soar into the record books, securing their place in aviation history as 21st century pioneers of flight.",

        "article": "(EW.com) -- When Jacob (Anton Yelchin) meets Anna (Felicity Jones) in the exquisite, happy/sad young-love story \"Like Crazy,\" it's only after Anna makes the first move. She's a spunky British visiting student at a Los Angeles university and an aspiring writer; he's a quiet American classmate and an aspiring furniture designer. Anna's instincts are good: The two quickly fall rapturously, totally head-over-heels in love. And the magic of this glowing little award-winner by director/co-writer Drake Doremus (\"Douchebag\") is that we believe every skip and flutter of their beating hearts, even as those beats are challenged by forces beyond their control: When Anna returns to her family in London after graduation, visa problems keep her there. Doremus has said he developed \"Like Crazy\" based on his own experience with a long-term, long-distance relationship; he's attentive to the million little frustrations that can nibble away at even the most passionate commitment, moments pinpointed by the production's handheld camera work. Favorite returning TV shows in trouble . Equal storytelling credit goes to fast-rising stars Yelchin (\"Star Trek\") and Jones (\"Brideshead Revisited\"), who immersed themselves in deep improvisatory work with their director to arrive at such a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love in all its ecstasy and agony. (The movie had no set script.) There's no accounting for chemistry, of course, not only in the success of love affairs and movie-star pairings but also in the way audiences respond to onscreen romance. One viewer's delight in \"(500) Days of Summer\" is another one's antsiness with its structural tricks. (That's me.) 'Survivor' recap: Ultimate Sacrifice or Stupidity? With no such narrative artifice, no Love Story-ish terminal illness or other tragedy to stimulate audience tear ducts, and none of the mood miseries or big-name lures of \"Blue Valentine,\" \"Like Crazy\" tells the truth, simply: Love is thrilling. And -- just because of the way life happens -- sometimes love hurts. A- . See full article at EW.com.

        "article": "Angelic: Emani Moss, 10, pictured here a a toddler, was starved to death before her body was set on fire and stuffed into a trash can . The paternal grandmother of a 10-year-old Georgia girl whose emaciated body was discovered burned in a trash can over the weekend said the system had failed the child. Eman and Tiffany Moss, of Lawrenceville, Georgia, have been arrested and charged with murder, concealing a body, and child cruelty after police say they had starved to death their daughter, Emani, and then set her body on fire to cover up the crime. Police reports released since Saturday, when Emani's malnourished remains were found in a garbage bin outside her home in suburban Atlanta, indicate that the 10-year-old tried to run away from home and showed up at school with bruises and welts. 'My baby went through hell,' her grandmother Robin Moss told Atlanta Journal Constitution. According to the woman, after Emani had confided in her that she was being abused by her parents, her son and his wife kept the 10-year-old away from her. \u2018Detectives believe the victim was isolated from people outside of her family in the weeks before her death,\u2019 said Gwinnett police spokesman Cpl. Jake Smith. \u2018She did not attend school outside the home during this school year.\u2019 Robin Moss\u2019 attorney said the woman tried to get child services to open an investigation into allegations of abuse, but no action had been taken. Scroll down for video . Inconsolable: Robin Moss, Emani's paternal grandmother, said she had fought to win custody of the 10-year-old and asked child services officials to investigate possible abuse, but no action was taken . Isolated: Police say her parents kept little Emani away from people outside of the immediate family and did not let her attend school . Miss Moss also said she had fought to win custody of her granddaughter, but the state would not let her have Emani. \u2018I don't understand how the system kept putting her back in that home,\u2019 Moss said. The bereaved grandmother explained that she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had developed a strong bond. In an interview with WSBTV, Robin Moss said that since her granddaughter\u2019s death, she cannot sleep because she can 'see her hurt.' Division of Family and Children Services officials released a statement Tuesday announcing that it will look into the way the agency handled Emani\u2019s case. Special bond: Robin Moss said she helped raise Emani from the time she was 4 years old, and the two had a relationship akin to that of a mother and daughter . Horrific death: Both Eman (left) and Tiffany Moss have been charged with murder, cruelty to children in the first degree and concealing a body. Tiffany had previously been arrested for beating her boyfriend's daughter . Horrific: Police found the body inside this trash can and said that there was evidence that it had been burned . Authorities conducted an autopsy on . Emani Sunday and determined that her body was burned after she was . dead, likely in an effort to conceal the crime, said Gwinnett County . Police Cpl. Jake Smith. Emani . may have died as early as October 30 and was severely underweight when . her body was found, Smith said. He said the autopsy showed the girl had . been denied food for several days before her death. Both Eman Moss and his second wife have criminal histories. The father was arrested in 2004 on charges of battery and cruelty to children after police said he allegedly beat his first wife in front of Emani. On . March 19, 2010, then-6-year-old Emani told a school nurse she was . afraid to go home with her bad report card because she was afraid her . parents would hurt her, according to one of the police reports. When the nurse investigated further, she found the girl had bruises on her body and reported it to police. Police . took Emani and her stepmother to department headquarters for interviews . that day and said Emani had severe bruises and welts on her chest, . back, shoulders, arms and legs, the police report said. Burned to death: Emani Moss was found burned to death, her father (left) and stepmother (right) are each charged with murder - leaving loved ones shocked . Tiffany . Moss told police she only hit the girl with a belt three times, the . report said. She was arrested on a child-cruelty charge. The . Georgia Division of Family and Children Services signed a 2010 plea . deal ordering Tiffany Moss to serve five years of probation for beating . Emani, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday. In July 2012, Emani tried running away from home, the police reports show. The . girl's grandmother, Robin Moss, was quoted by local news media on . Sunday and Monday as saying that she suspected Emani was being abused, . but couldn't persuade state authorities to grant her custody. Emani's . mother, Danita Leaks, told Atlanta FOX affiliate WAGA-TV on Monday that . she and Eman Moss fought over custody for two to three years and she . was unaware that her daughter was being abused. Disturbing call: The girl's father, pictured, told police he was suicidal and that his daughter was dead after drinking a chemical . \u2018If . I would have known that him and his wife were abusing my baby, I would . not have let her stay over there,\u2019 she told the television station. Authorities . initially said Eman Moss called police early Saturday saying he was . suicidal and that his daughter died after drinking some type of chemical . substance. Smith said . Monday that the detail about Moss being suicidal was a miscommunication . during the 911 call and was later clarified with the dispatcher. Police said they won't release audio from the call because it's part of the investigation and could be used in court.",

        "article": "Sir Jimmy Savile's campaign of alleged child abuse took place over six decades . Jimmy Savile's alleged campaign of child sex abuse could include as many as 60 victims spanning over six decades, investigators have revealed. Police have trebled their original estimates of the number of preyed upon youngsters, after soaring numbers of alleged victims have come forward in the wake of the scandal. Detectives said the figure accounts for 'predominately' teenage girls. Today it was also reported Savile was previously investigated by police six times after a series of sex abuse claims, the first one taking place as early as 1958. And fresh allegations have come to light that the alleged child molester was 'given the keys' to Broadmoor secure hospital around 1988, when cabinet minister Ken Clarke was Health Secretary. It was claimed the predatory paedophile molested a 17-year-old patient at the high security mental hospital, Broadmoor, which he was given the gold-plated keys to as a reward for his volunteering. The Department of Health (DoH) has been dragged into . the scandal over its decision to appoint Savile to lead a 'taskforce' overseeing management restructuring at the hospital. The department will carry out an investigation into how he was given the position and the DoH could be sued by victims as it was running the place at the time. Mr Clarke was forced to defend himself last night, saying: 'I have no recollection of ever having met Jimmy Savile and no . recollection of these events. 'The DoH are rightly now investigating to . establish the facts.' A spokeswoman for Mr Clarke said that as he only became . health secretary in July 1988, Savile's appointment to the role at Broadmoor . may have been instigated by someone else. In a statement, the DoH said: 'We will investigate the . Department of Health's conduct in apparently appointing Savile to this role. 'In hindsight he should very obviously not have been . appointed.' Scroll down for video . There are now reports of alleged abuse starting in 1959 up to and including 2006, the year in which Savile is pictured, right. The former DJ is pictured left in 1960, two years after the first police investigation . There are growing . fears NHS bosses turned a blind eye to sick and disabled children being . attacked by the former DJ because he raised so much money for them. Scotland Yard detectives are now in contact with 14 other forces investigating the Jim'll Fix It  star's abuses, with police pursuing 340 lines of inquiry across the country. So far 12 allegations of sexual offences have been officially . recorded but this number is increasing. Savile was allegedly investigated by police during a series of sex abuse inquiries since 1958 but each time he evaded justice. Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, left, was reportedly Health Secretary when Savile, right, was given the keys to Broadmoor hospital where he allegedly abused a 17-year-old girl . He was first investigated by police 'for interfering with young girls' when working as a nightclub manager in Leeds as long ago as 1958, his former bodyguard told The Sunday Telegraph. In the late 1960s there was an inquiry into underage sex taking place in the Top of the Pops changing rooms, according to the show's then producer. Police reportedly interviewed BBC staff but did not pursue a case. There was an allegation in 1971 that the late TV host was involved with a 15-year-old dancer on Top of the Pops, who committed suicide. And there were claims Savile was abusing patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the late 1970s, allegations which were reported to police but there was not enough evidence to proceed. In the past five years there were two further police investigations. These included one in 2007, in which Surrey Police questioned Savile over allegations of child sex abuse in the 1970s at Duncroft school. But the case was dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence. A spokesman for the force said: 'In 2007 Surrey Police received an historic . allegation of indecent assault which is alleged to have occurred at a . children's home in Staines during the 1970s. The allegation was investigated . and an individual was interviewed under caution. 'The matter was referred to the . Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was . insufficient evidence to take any further action.' A senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile, pictured, over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago . Meanwhile, photographs of Savile in the act of grooming vulnerable girls at the school for fragile children have emerged. One of the photos shows him looking surprised to be captured as he holds a private conversation with five girls. The other photo, obtained by the Sunday Express, snaps the paedophile in a cheesy pose with his arms open, surrounded by eight teenage girls. One of the girls is pictured lifting her skirt to show a garter. One of his victims, pictured in the photo, was a pupil aged just 14 when she was abused by Savile in 1977. She summoned up the courage to report him to her head teacher but instead of the police being called she was sent to her room and deprived of food, she claimed. She said: 'He came to the school a couple of times a year, bringing presents of records and magazines and was far too tactile with the pupils, who saw him as a superstar.' After being invited into an empty office with him at the age of 14, she claims he molested her for several minutes, ignoring her protests. She recalled: 'I said to him \"Get off, you can't do that\", but he wouldn't listen. In the end I had to push him off and then I ran into a nearby bathroom and locked myself in.' Last Tuesday police were investigating claims Savile abused 20 victims and this figure doubled to 40 potential victims on Friday. The alleged cases of abuse took place in studios, care homes, schools, hospitals and nightclubs. Commander Peter Spindler, head of MPS Specialist Crime . Investigations said: \u2018We can now confirm that we have received information from . the public that suggest allegations against Jimmy Savile span six decades with . reports starting in 1959 up to and including 2006. \u2018Having now had the opportunity to review progress one week . on I have revised my estimate of the number of likely victims to be about 60. \u2018Once again I want to thank those who have come forward and . reassure them, and anyone else who contacts us, they will be listened to.\u2019 The scandal emerged when ITV screened a documentary . in which five women alleged they were abused by the late DJ and broadcaster. The BBC came under fire after it was revealed Newsnight abandoned an investigation into the alleged abuse in December 2011. And a senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago. The property Savile would stay in when visiting Broadmoor Hospital, to which he was given the keys in 1988 . Derek Chinnery, who as Radio 1 controller from 1978 to 1985 was Savile's boss, admitted that he quizzed the presenter directly about the rumours of suspected abuse. Mr Chinnery told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House: 'I asked, \"what's all this, these rumours we hear about you Jimmy?'.\" 'And he said, \"that's all nonsense\". There was no reason to disbelieve (Savile).' Savile worked at Radio 1 from 1969 to 1989 presenting a show of chart songs from previous decades. Speaking about his acceptance of Savile's denial, Mr Chinnery told the BBC: 'It's easy now to say how could you just believe him just like that.' He added: 'He was the sort of man that attracted rumours, after all, because he was single, he was always on the move, he was always going around the country.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the corporation has lessons to learn following the allegations, saying, 'they must never ever, ever happen again'. He told Sky News the revelations were 'appalling', adding: 'The BBC in particular has to learn . lessons from this, I think they've come forward with the right approach, . saying we will investigate, we'll do it properly'. Sir Michael Lyons, who was chairman of the BBC Trust from 2007 to 2011, told Sky News: 'There may well be lessons here to learn about the way that we tolerate the behaviour of predatory men, particularly when they are in powerful positions. 'And there may be lessons to learn - I am sure there - about the license that we sometimes allow to celebrities. This goes well beyond the BBC although there are issues for the BBC to address.' The veteran DJ in 2001 when he said he didn't care about his legacy in an interview . The late TV presenter said he did not care if he was remembered as a conning pervert and abuser when he died. When asked the question by a reporter in an interview in 2001 when he was 74, he said: 'If I\u2019m gone that\u2019s that. B******s to my legacy.' Savile's shameless attitude emerged when grilled about accusations he was a psychopath and paedophile, according to The People. Instead of denying the claims, he said: 'Whatever is said after I'm gone is irrelevant'. After being asked if he was 'into little girls', he said: 'I\u2019d rather not even opinionate on this. I\u2019ll leave it to the psychologists to sort out the psychology of child abuse.' He then reportedly joked about the issue, claiming he hated children.",

Called Wingman, it was created by 24 old New York copywriter Gabe Whaley. The app will use in-flight wifi or bluetooth to connect people, and is about to begin testing. The Wingman app hopes to bring a Tinder-like dating experience to the skies . Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder. Users create a profile with their picture, first name, age, occupation, flight number and the airline they\u2019re traveling with - and whether they\u2019re traveling for business or pleasure. The app then displays a list of travelers on the same flight, and if you find one attractive, you can opt to start a conversation. 'The beta, much like the final version, will be extremely simple,' he told MailOnline. 'To create your profile, you simply provide a photo, your first name, age, and occupation. 'All the info you provide at your discretion. 'Once you board a flight, you will input your flight number, airline, and whether you are traveling for business, pleasure or both. 'The app will then match you with other wingman users who have similar data, and you can choose to pursue a conversation or not (much like how tinder works, although with Wingman you won't have to wait for mutually anonymous \"likes\" before being matched.)' Wingman isn\u2019t available yet, but you can sign up for notifications about its development. The team have been working on it since December, and hope to release it in April - if Apple allows it. However, they do have a backup plan, and will release the app as a web site if it is banned from app stores. Wingman works in a similar way to Tinder.

Avoids jail: Zoey Tomlinson, 18, of Manchester, was annoyed by the 20-year-old man's text messages . A teen mother laid a honeytrap for a man trying to woo her by saying she was having a bath at home before letting him in - where he was subjected to an attack by thugs, a court heard. Zoey Tomlinson, 18, of Gorton, Manchester, was annoyed by the 20-year-old man's text messages and asked friends to warn him off - but the thugs went too far, Manchester Crown Court was told. They subjected the man to a sustained attack last December in which he was punched, kicked and scalded with hot water. Tomlinson has avoided jail after Wednesday's hearing, but her three friends have been sent to prison. Tomlinson lured the man to her home after saying she was in the bath and would be 'waiting for him' - and later answered the front door in her pyjamas before beckoning him in, Christopher Beckwith, prosecuting, said. But her accomplices rushed out and attacked him, as her two-year-old daughter slept upstairs. Judge Michael Leeming told the court on Wednesday that the 'sustained and unprovoked attack' was 'wholly distressing' for the victim. Hearing: Tomlinson asked friends to warn him off but the thugs went too far, Manchester Crown Court heard . Tomlinson admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was given a nine-month suspended custodial sentence. Three of her accomplices were traced and have also admitted causing ABH .

Initial researches show it to be U-168, a hunter-killer of the German 'Kriegsmarine', which claimed several Allied vessels before it was sent to a watery grave by torpedoes in 1944. A team found the wreck, which contains at least 17 skeletons, north of Java earlier this month after a tip-off from local divers. Sunken: This wreckage was found by divers off the coast of Indonesia . Skeletons: A skull found by Indonesian archaeologists at the site of a sunken German submarine from World War II . 'This is the first time we have found a foreign submarine from the war in our waters,' said Bambang Budi Utomo, head of the research team at the National Archaeology Centre that found the vessel. 'This is an extraordinary find that will certainly provide useful information about what took place in the Java Sea during World War II.' As well as the human skeletons, dinner plates bearing swastikas, batteries, binoculars and a bottle of hair oil were pulled from the wreck. He said further tests were being carried out on the objects to confirm the submarine was indeed 'U-168'. The sub was a type IX C/40 and was launched in March 1942. Captain Helmuth Pich was its commander on four missions for the Third Reich. He survived with 26 other crew hands when it was lost around 1.30am on October 6, 1944, under fire from Dutch submarine HrMs Zwaardvisch - 23 German submariners died in the attack.

In its three hunting expeditions for Allied vessels in wartime, his sub sunk one British, one Norwegian and one Greek freighter. Bambang Budi Utomo, head of the research team at the National Archaeology Centre that found the vessel, said it was unlikely the wreck, 60 miles (100km) northeast of Karimunjawa island, would be lifted from the seabed any time soon - due to its sheer size and the cost involved. U-168 was part of the Monsun U-Boats, . which were a group of vessels sent away from the German empire to attack . allied ships along trade routes. Japan occupied Indonesia during World War II, which was then still known by its colonial name of the Dutch East Indies. The Monsun U-Boats operated out of the Dutch East Indies, Jakarta and Sabang between 1943 and 1945. Of the 14 U-boats based in the Far East, only four made it back to Europe. U-168 sailed from France in July 1943 and arrived at Penang in November of the same year. Survivor: Captain Helmuth Pich, pictured, was in charge of the sunken vessel, but lived to tell the tale . Teacup: Several artifacts like teacups were found alongside 17 human skeletons in the submarine . Artifacts: Markings on a plate found by Indonesian archaeologists. They discovered the German submarine that was torpedoed off the main island of Java during the Second World War .",

Hamilton had been either stopped or was slowing down to turn left, reports the Nashua Telegraph, when Cullen\u2019s Toyota pickup smashed into her. \u2018At the last minute - we don't know if it was driver distraction or what the cause was, we haven't been able to determine that,\u2019 Brookline Police Chief Quigley said. \u2018He swerved to avoid hitting her and still struck her on the very right rear corner of her vehicle, forcing her to come over to the northbound lane.\u2019 Tragic: Mr Whitcomb, who owns a local heating and cooling business, is a longtime volunteer firefighter in the small town of Brookline. Katie, right, recently celebrated her 30th birthday with her family . The crash involved three cars. The other two drivers in the crash were not injured . That\u2019s when James Ciprotti, 37, of Weare, New Hampshire, smashed into Hamilton head-on in his Ford F-250. Cullen and Ciprotti were given medical evaluations, but neither was injured.

        "article": "The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its 30ft-high porchways. The hoses outside the front  of\u00a0Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission. News of their existence emerged via CBS News\u00a0this week, triggering outcry from the wider community. Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources'. Against building regulations: The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its porchways . Discreet: The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission . Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless, added that the time-triggered mechanisms were 'certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.' However, the church defended the sprinkler idea stating that it wasn't safe having homeless people and drug addicts lurking when families were visiting. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, told CBS that staff tried to find other forms of accommodation for those without shelter. 'We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,' Lyford said. 'To Saint Anthony's soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.' Wrong move: Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources' Roughing it: A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas . Lyford claimed he did not know about the sprinkler system until it was brought to his attention but another church staff member said the spouts were installed over a year ago. According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas. 'You've got some pretty hardcore homeless people who actually don\u2019t care... so they\u2019ll go in there and sleep.' Robert, another homeless San Francisco inhabitant, said that as well as the water systems there were signs pasted up stating 'No Trespassing.' Time-triggered mechanism: According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. However, now the sprinklers will be taken down as they reportedly violate the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection code. The church has 15 days to comply and remove the system. Bishop William Justice,\u00a0the rector of Saint Mary's Cathedral, issued a statement apologizing for any upset the church's homeless deterrent had caused. He said the sprinklers were modeled on similar systems used in the city\u2019s Financial District 'as a safety, security and cleanliness measure to avoid the situation where needles, feces and other dangerous items were regularly being left in these hidden doorways. 'The problem was particularly dangerous because students and elderly people regularly pass these locations on their way to school and mass every day,' he added. Justice said since the archdiocese has learned the system may violate the city\u2019s water-use laws, work to remove it would be 'completed by the end of the day'.",

        "article": "(CNN)  -- Top seeds Serbia have been forced to withdraw from Saturday's Hopman Cup final because of an injury to former world number one Ana Ivanovic. The 2008 French Open champion tore a stomach muscle during her straight sets loss to Justine Henin of Belgium at the annual team event in Perth, Australia on Thursday. Ivanovic went on to partner Novak Djokovic in a three-set mixed doubles loss to Henin and partner Reuben Benelmans, but after practicing on Friday morning made the decision to withdraw from the tournament. \"This morning, I was playing some points and on one serve I felt a sharp pain and I couldn't even hit or move after that,\" Ivanovic told reporters. Ivanovic and world number three Djokovic -- whose singles win over Benelmans on Thursday secured Serbia's final berth -- will be replaced in the weekend's title-clash by Belgium who finished in second place in group A. Henin and Bemelmans will now face the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and John Isner in the final, after Mattek-Sands's straight sets defeat of British teenager Laura Robson on Friday was enough for the American's to secure their place at the top of group B. The injury is an early-season blow for Ivanovic, who recently made a comeback to the WTA tour following a string of fitness problems. But the 23-year-old said she can recover in time for the first grand slam of the year, the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on January 17. \"It's definitely a scare,\" the current world number 17 told reporters. \"At this moment in time my chances are still very good because I stopped in time. I'm positive I will be fit. \"It's very frustrating because this has been the case for a long time now. But I have to stay positive.\" Reigning French Open champion Francesca Schiavone was also forced to retire from her Hopman Cup singles match against France's Kristina Mladenovic on Friday, however, it is not thought her injury is serious. Elsewhere, at the Brisbane International top seed Robin Soderling of Sweden progressed to the semifinal of the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday.

        "article": "By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:41 EST, 7 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:04 EST, 7 August 2013 . Ten of Britain\u2019s biggest benefits fraudsters have tried to con the taxpayer out of almost \u00a33.7million. A rogue\u2019s gallery of criminals punished by the courts in the last year reveal the scams used by a hardcore minority to claim handouts to which they are not entitled. They have been sentenced a total of 30 years in jail after using fake identities, secret bank accounts and fictitious illnesses to claim benefits. Scroll down for video . Barry Brooks, who insisted on being known as 'Sir Barry' and claimed he could barely walk, falsely claimed \u00a31.8million after setting up a sham business pretending he was helping disabled people get work . Ministers vowed to use new technology and surveillance powers to \u2018make it even tougher for these criminals\u2019. The line-up includes a man who pretended to be in a wheelchair who claimed \u00a31.8million in support for disabled employees at a company which did not exist, a horse breeder who claimed to be living alone who had an affluent lifestyle with her partner and pedigree dogs and a Liverpool football steward filmed hanging off a tree who claimed he could not work. In many cases cash, property and valuables have been seized to recoup some of the money claimed fraudulently. Welfare reform minister Lord Freud said: \u2018Our fraud teams have the powers and technology to catch fraudsters, but we are determined to make it even tougher for these criminals. \u2018With Universal Credit, benefit fraud will be harder to commit in the first place and easier to detect, and we are calling on the public to help with the crackdown. \u2018We all know that it is a minority of people who try to commit fraud, but these criminals need to know, with the hardworking British taxpayer on our side, we are on their tracks.\u2019 Fanta Sesay (left) was jailed for 28 months for a \u00a3400,000 fraud using fake IDs to work in an East London hospital while claiming benefits. Edward Cavanagh (centre) claimed he could barely leave the house and received \u00a398,779 in disability benefits before a tip-off to a fraud hotline led to him being filmed walking his dogs. Over six years Paul Vickers (right) claimed \u00a366,800.42 because he could not walk more than 3 metres without stopping, but was working in property maintenance and selling cars . Michael Dunne was jailed after claiming \u00a374,000 . in benefits, claiming he was unable to walk but he was filmed leaving . his home and hanging by his arms from a tree . The . cases were brought to justice after anonymous tip-offs, councils . working with the Department for Work and Pensions and new technology to . track and trace the fraudsters. In one of the largest frauds Barry Brooks, who insisted on being known as \u2018Sir Barry\u2019, was sentenced . in August last year to 8 years in jail after pretending he needed a . wheelchair to con his way to a millionaire lifestyle. He set up a sham . business pretending he was helping disabled people get work.\u00a0 He had . owned 5 properties which have all been repossessed, sold and the equity . paid into a restrained account. Michael Dunne, 58, from Kirkby, was jailed for 40 weeks in . February after falsely claiming \u00a374,000 in benefits. He claimed he was . virtually unable to walk and required care during the day, but was found . to be working as a steward for Liverpool and Everton and was filmed . walking uphill to Anfield Football ground and hanging off a tree by his . arms. DWP . fraud investigator James Blake said: \u2018These cases really show the . methods that benefit fraudsters try to use to play the system. \u2018With . many tools at our disposal, including covert surveillance equipment, we . can gain evidence against them without them being aware at all. \u2018Our . teams are also able to pinpoint suspects and suspicious activity . following evidence and conflicting paperwork with greater accuracy than . ever before. \u2018These criminals need to be aware that we will be investigating them.\u2019 Gladys Popoola (left) was jailed for two years after claiming benefits while . receiving rental income from three rental properties and hiding secret . bank accounts in the UK and Kenya; Andrew Pishides (centre), who is partially blind, claimed \u00a3175,926 including for support with taxi journeys to work, but he did not leave his home and faked receipts to make the claims. Helen Gough (right) was jailed for two years for claiming \u00a3104,175.18 in benefits as a single person with caring duties while actually living with her partner and pedigree dog and working as a horse breeder . David Millward, 55, claimed he could not walk 30ft and illegally pocketed \u00a3100,000 in benefits before being caught on camera herding cattle and climbing fences .

        "article": "Dan Lydiate has completed his dual contract move from Racing Metro to the Ospreys that will 'send a message' about Welsh rugby's new bargaining power. The British and Irish Lions flanker joins Sam Warburton on a National Dual Contract, as Welsh bosses aim to reverse the exodus of top talent to England and France. The 26-year-old has been released by Racing Metro for an immediate return to Wales, and will start training with the Ospreys later this week. Ospreys Dan Lydiate has signed a dual contract with the region and the Welsh Rugby Union . Lydiate was given dispensation to join the Ospreys rather than return to first club Newport Gwent Dragons, with his wife keen to be close to her family in west Wales. 'I am extremely pleased we have been able to bring a player of Dan's undoubted calibre back home,' said WRU chairman Gareth Davies. 'His decision will send a message out to Welsh qualified players that staying in Wales under the protection of a National Dual Contract offers a great opportunity.' Lydiate left the Dragons for Racing Metro last summer after seven years at the club but failed to settle in the French Top 14. His quickfire return to the Welsh set-up follows months of politicking that led to the Rugby Services Agreement between union bosses and regional chiefs. Head coach Warren Gatland will now turn attention to completing the remaining 10 dual deals he has lined up. 'I am delighted to have secured a National Dual Contract and I am looking forward to doing my best for the Ospreys while I aim to win selection for Wales,' said Lydiate. Lydiate tackles Jean de Villiers of South Africa during the Castle Lager Outgoing Tour match in November . 'Having a National Dual Contract gives me the certainty I need for my future and I will now be able to concentrate one hundred per cent on my rugby. 'I enjoyed my time with Racing Metro but this is the right move for me as I want to achieve my full potential as a player based here in Wales.' Chief executive Roger Lewis said Lydiate's deal represents the fruit of almost three years of pressing for dual contracts from the WRU. 'This is a landmark day for Welsh rugby and I am grateful to all involved for the level of cooperation this signifies,' said Lewis. 'National Dual Contracts will help us keep international class talent here in Wales available for Regional rugby and for international selection. 'The WRU has been actively attempting to introduce National Dual Contracts for some two-and-a-half years, so securing Dan as a National Dual Contract player is a significant step forward. British and Irish Lions flanker joins Sam Warburton (above) on a National Dual Contract . 'Dan Lydiate suddenly became available while Warren was preparing his list of National Dual Contract candidates which offered us the opportunity to bring a key international player back to Wales. 'All the players on National Dual Contracts will get the best coaching and conditioning while having their careers managed in ways which will ensure they achieve and maintain their full potential with the Regions and Wales. 'The aim of the contracts is to stem the flow of our best talent abroad and to ensure the players staying in Wales will have the very best care to prolong their careers at the highest level.' Wales boss Gatland expects the dual contract system to boost Test results in the long-run. 'This is an important step forward for Welsh rugby and will reap rewards in playing standards over the long term,' said Gatland. 'We can now focus on ensuring all our best young players realise the best way for them to realise their talent in full is to stay in Wales under the new structure we have created.'",

        "article": "By . James Nye and Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:40 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:42 EST, 9 October 2013 . An off-duty, undercover NYPD detective has been arrested today over a motorcycle gang attack on an SUV driver last week in New York City. Police spokesman John McCarthy confirmed that Wojciech Braszczok surrendered on Tuesday to faces riot and criminal mischief charges. The detective's attorney hasn't responded to messages. The officer had previously denied any involvement as his fellow . bikers pulled Alexian Lien from his SUV and beat him. The cop's lawyer said today that the detective had only witnessed the attack however video evidence appears to show him smashing the rear window of the SUV. Scroll down for video . Hunt: The NYPD are looking for four bikers involved in the vicious assault on a family driving through Manhattan on September 29 . Several members of the motorcycle gang are being sought out for questioning by the NYPD . The officer, a seven-year veteran of the force, is expected to be charged with criminal mischief, according to CBS. The . officer is assigned to the NYPD Intelligence Division, but sources did . not reveal whether he was on assignment or whether his actions were a . ploy to protect his cover. Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD detectives' union, said the undercover officer was forced to make a difficult decision. Hurt: Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by . bikers in New York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked . Smashed: Police claim there is video evidence that appears to show Braszczok smashing the rear window of the SUV . 'Compromising . his identity could compromise all the work he's doing and his safety as . well,' Palladino told NBC. 'It's very difficult to lead a double life.' The officer now faces an internal investigation because . he didn't inform higher brass that he was with the bikers, let alone . the crime scene, until three days after the attack, the Post said. Manhattan district attorney\u2019s Trials . Division, Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that the city cannot chase . everyone involved saying: 'Prematurely charging individuals with . low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation and . could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of . serious crimes.' The explosive development came as another biker headed to court over the incident. In court: One of the bikers, Craig Wright, was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of gang assault in the attack . Accused: Wright, with his attorney Mitchell Elman, allegedly stomped on Lien three times in the video . Craig . Wright, 29, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday and . ordered held on $100,000 bail, even though his lawyer said he was . innocent. Prosecutors . argued that Wright, from Canarsie, Brooklyn, had been caught on video . stomping of Lien at least three times after he was dragged from the SUV. Wright was arrested Monday on charges of gang assault, assault and unlawful imprisonment. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a . broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve . and now may never walk again . Cruz is charged with reckless driving and unlawful imprisonment, but he has retained an attorney and is fighting the charges . Police . say the bikers swarmed the SUV on a highway and when driver Alexian . Lien bumped a motorcycle whose rider, Christopher Cruz, had apparently . deliberately slowed down, several bikers surrounded the SUV and began to . damage the vehicle. Christopher Cruz, pictured here, could face additional charges, police say . Lien . sped off, plowing into a motorcyclist. Bikers chased the SUV, pulled . Lien from his vehicle and began beating him in front of his wife and . two-year-old daughter, police said. Large portions of the September 29 incident were captured on video and posted online. Three . other bikers, including Robert Sims, 35, and Reginald Chance, 37, both . from Brooklyn, have been charged in the incident. Authorities say Sims . is the man captured on video pulling open the door of Lien's SUV, and . that Chance was seen using his helmet to bash in the vehicle's window. Christopher Cruz, faces charges of unlawful imprisonment, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, endangering the welfare of a child and menacing. Police say Cruz triggered the initial confrontation by slowing down his bike and then going to confront Lien after being bumped. Cruz has denied brake-checking Lien and says he was merely trying to exchange driver information. Lien has not been charged. The biker he ran over, Edwin Meises Jr., suffered two broken legs and spinal injuries that his family says will leave him paralyzed. Lien's wife has said her family was in danger and her husband had no choice but to flee the scene. Busted: Reginald Chance is accused of shaming Mr Lien's window with his helmet before beating him . Chance turned himself into police and was arraigned in Manhattan this weekend . This comes as Cruz says it's his life that's ruined. The . 28-year-old father of two claims he never intended to box in Lien's . Range Rover SUV on New York City's West Side Highway - he was only . changing lanes and looked back to see where his friends are. Cruz . isn't charged with participating in the horrific six-on-one beating . that left Mr Lien hospitalized, but police believe that he was trying to . force him to slow down or stop. He is charged with reckless driving and . false imprisonment. He says the charges and the publicity from the case have ruined him. 'It's turned my life upside down right now,' he told ABC's 'Good Morning America' Monday. He also denied that he was driving recklessly. Charged: Robert Sims in court after he was . arrested and charged with Attempted Gang Assault 1 and 2 and Criminal . Possession of a Weapon against a Alexian Lien and his family on . September 29, 2013 in New York City . 'I had no intentions to slow him down . or to cause any type of problem,' Cruz said. 'I didn't think I was . doing anything wrong by just cutting into another lane.' Video from a fellow rider's helmet cam shows Cruz looking back as he changes lanes inches in front of the SUV. Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle. After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him. Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him. When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head. Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives during the shocking mob attack . But Cruz says he has no guilt about the incident, which all started with the crash he is accused of causing. 'I don't feel responsible,' he said. 'But I do feel bad for the family that go hurt.' The New York Post reported this weekend that detectives believe up to six bikers participated in the savage beatdown of Mr Lien. Kevin . Bresloff, the biker who filmed much of the encounter, says he has . received death threats from other members of the biker club because he . is cooperating with police detectives investigating the incident.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- What would you do if you had to wait 90 minutes for your pizza to be delivered? Stare out the window with sad, hungry eyes? Call in screaming to cancel your order? Take to Twitter to vent your #waitingforever fury? Or take matters into your hands and launch your own pizza delivery store? Ritesh Doshi, 32, did the latter. Back in 2011, Doshi, an investment banker whose career had taken him to London, New York and Amman, returned to his native country Kenya to visit his parents. One night, he and his family decided to order out. \"We had to wait for about 90 minutes for the pizza to be delivered,\" remembers Doshi. \"We then ordered again another night from another place and it took 75 minutes,\" he adds. \"You just couldn't get a decent pizza in a reasonable amount of time. So I thought, you know what, anywhere in the world that I've lived and worked you can get a pizza in 35 minutes -- so why not in Nairobi?\" Read this: Street vendor builds biz empire . That was it. Soon after, Doshi left his career in banking and set his sights on the pizza industry. After talking to several people, he decided to bring to Nairobi the concept of Naked Pizza, an international franchise thriving on the usage of fresh ingredients. \"If you look at the dictionary definition of naked, natural is one of the definitions that come up,\" says Doshi. \"We have no weird chemicals added to our food, we don't add sugar to any of our products,\" he adds. \"Our meats are all hormone free -- everything that we use is natural.\" Naked Pizza was founded in the U.S. in 2006. Outside America, there are five stores in Dubai. Kenya's first outlet was launched about a year ago and since then sales have been growing every month. \"The response from the customers has been fantastic,\" says Doshi. \"We really saw an opportunity to create a healthier product and get it to people quickly.\" Tasty success . Inside the Naked Pizza store in Westlands, an affluent Nairobi neighborhood, a group of green-shirted young men line up behind the counter to cut vegetables, shred cheese and prepare the sauce for the day. On slow days, Doshi says, there are between 100 and 150 orders. At busier times, the figure rises to 350-400. The company's menu includes nine options, but Doshi says the most popular ones are the superbiotic -- a mouthful of artichoke, baby spinach, mixed pepper, mushroom, garlic, red onion and coriander -- and the omnivore, a pizza comprised of beef pepperoni, beef hamburger, turkey ham, mixed pepper, mushroom and black olives. Read this: Africa's techies board the StartupBus . Yet, tracing some of these ingredients has not always been an easy task. \"Things like artichokes and jalapenos were hard to source,\" says Doshi. He explains that building a supply chain and navigating Kenya's bureaucratic machine have both been very challenging. \"We need licenses for literally everything,\" he says. \"Our signs, our bikes, for any kind of branding we do and a whole host of other things.\" Love of pizza . Despite the challenges, however, the young entrepreneur is determined to \"get Nairobi naked.\" He is optimistic about the venture's future, saying that he's already developing a second store and is actively looking for more retail estate. At the heart of this is the brand's appeal to people of all incomes from both the local and expat community in Nairobi. \"The love of pizza is an international thing and we've been able to really transcend economic boundaries, racial boundaries and age boundaries,\" says Doshi. \"There is a great story -- an old lady who had never tried pizza before was visiting her daughter from outside Nairobi; her daughter is a regular customer and this was the first time she tried pizza.\" Read this: MyMusic dances to the mobile beat . Doshi says the growing breed of young Kenyan returnees has also been one of the main drivers of Naked Pizza's success. \"There is a large, increasing number of Kenyans coming home,\" he says. \"People who studied and lived all over the world -- a lot of them are coming back and actually a large part of our customers is made up of returning Kenyans.\" A repat himself, Doshi says he's not regretted quitting his promising career in investment banking to set up a business in Nairobi, a rising international city and economic market. \"It's great to be here,\" he says. \"It's great to be part of the growth story at home -- for a long time I've reading about it from away, so it was great to participate in that.\" Looking ahead, Doshi is aiming to grow the brand while changing people's eating habits in the process. \"We think we can do that by delivering a great product, with great customer service,\" he says. As for the waiting time? \"If you're ordering in the store, you should have that in under 10 minutes,\" says Doshi. \"If it goes out for delivery, you should have that within about 35 minutes -- every single time.\"",

A garden centre owner is in trouble after he built an illegal 'secret house' for his son and hid it within an innocuous tool shed he constructed in the grounds of his business. Council officers who discovered the property near Gloucester described it as a 'Tardis' and found in a raid it had a fully-furnished bedroom, lounge and tiled shower room. Because it was built with 'blatant disregard for the planning system' at the Fourboys Garden Centre in Woodfield, Stroud District Council have now ordered that it is torn down. Row: The secret house, which was meant to be a tool shed, contained a fully-furnished bedroom, lounge and shower room . Planning: Nestled in the idyllic Gloucestershire countryside, the contents of the shed was discovered after a raid by Stroud Council . But owner Gary Winchle is entering a legal battle with the local authority, accepting that part of the building was once used as a home but he has how removed fixtures and fittings. He has applied for permission to . keep the building as an equipment store and for plant preparation. 'The building was supposed to be a single storey structure for . business use, but without planning permission it had been built with two . storeys, and officers had received intelligence that its first floor was . being used as a residential flat. Claim: Owner Gary Winchle admits that the building at his business was lived in but now says these fixtures and fittings have been removed . 'When an officer was finally allowed in, the first floor was sparsely . furnished but did contain a fully fitted kitchen and appliances. Battle: Owner Mr Winchle has appealed against the decision as he said the property is now a shed again . 'Additionally, part of one of the rooms had been boarded off and . officers suspected that it hid a bathroom. After this visit officers . made several further attempts to gain access but were denied on each . occasion.\u2019 Then a secret raid this summer helped them get to the bottom of what was inside the toolshed. 'The council then approached Stroud Magistrates Court for a warrant to . enter the building without giving notice, and the magistrate agreed that . to give notice may allow the owner to remove the furniture and hide the . bathroom. 'Upon executing the warrant, officers found a fully furnished bedroom . and lounge together with, as suspected, a fully tiled shower room - . which had previously been hidden from them. The building was occupied by . a couple related to the land owner.' Gary Wichle declined to comment today but said after the council bust: ''I found it very distressing that three enforcement officers, two policemen, a building company and yourself come to the site with a warrant to break into the premises.'",

        "article": "The mother of a Texas middle school student wants an apology after an administrator colored on her son's head with a dark marker because they claim he had a 'gang-related' haircut. Monica Esquivel's son Kobi was attending Coronado Middle School in Plainview with a haircut featuring a line shaved on the side of his head for the last five months. An assistant principal told Kobi his hair was a 'distraction' and colored in the line with a marker earlier this week. Scroll down for video . Kobi shows where an assistant principal at\u00a0Coronado Middle School in Plainview, Texas, colored on his head . The line that was shaved in Kobi's dark hair (above) was supposed to look like it was a part . Monica Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize for what happened with Kobi . Officials from the Plainview Independent School District failed to notify Esquivel about what had happened with her son,\u00a0KCBD\u00a0reported. When she did speak to them, school administrators informed her Kobi's haircut could be considered gang related. She said: 'My son is not in a gang, he's not trying to be in a gang.\u00a0He dresses in khakis, a shirt, not in loose pants or anything, just real nice and casual. 'He isn't representing a gang or anything.' The school district's dress code policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines' The school district's executive director for administrative services, Greg Brown, said any concerns regarding the assistant principal's behavior will be addressed confidentially, according to the\u00a0Plainview Daily Herald. Brown said district policy 'prohibits designs shaved into the scalp and this includes lines'. He added: 'The dress code is a part of the parent/student handbook that is made available to all students online and in paper form. 'The dress code is specifically looked at by the administration who makes any changes that need to be made.' Final approval about the handbook is usually issued in July. Esquivel wants the Plainview Indepedent School District to apologize to her son and also update its dress code policy. Kobi will be allowed to grow his hair out to cover the shaved line. This situation is similar to one that happened about a year ago in Florida. Last January, a school counselor at Harns Marsh Middle School in Lehigh Acres shaved a student's head because he felt the 11-year-old's hair was a distraction and could be gang related, NBC 2 reported.",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:05 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:13 EST, 8 August 2013 . Jealous: Police says Ummad Rushdi, 30, was angry because his new girlfriend paid too much attention to her baby . A Pennsylvania man has been arrested and accused of stealing his girlfriend 7-month-old boy from his crib and killing him because he was 'interfering' with the boyfriend's relationship with the mother. Police say Ummad Rushdi, 30, killed little Hamza Ali at Rushdi's parents' house in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. He then took the baby's body to a rural road, where he buried it. Authorities believe Rushdi harmed Hamza because he believed the child was standing in the way of Rushdi's one-month relationship with the baby's mother Zainib Gaal. Miss Gaal told officers she had known Rushdi for three weeks. Despite extensive searches outside York and Columbia, Pennsylvania, police have not found the body of little Hamza. However, they fear the worst. 'We don't know where Hamza Ali is,' Upper Darby police superintendent Michael Chitwood told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'We hope Hamza is alive. We don't believe Hamza is alive.' Rushdi . was arrested early Wednesday and charged with kidnapping, unlawful . restraint, false imprisonment, interference with custody of a child and . endangering the welfare of a child. When police apprehended him at his home in York, they found with him with knife, a pair of handcuffs and $800. Tragic: Police believe Hamza Ali, aged just seven months, was killed by his mother's boyfriend. However, the baby's body has not been found . Miss Gaal told officers she demanded to know where her son was when she awoke Sunday and found him missing. However, . she did not report Hamza missing until Tuesday because Rushdi's brother . told her Rushdi had taken the infant boy to visit her parents in . Maine. For three days she waited for word on her child. On Tuesday night, Rushdi's brother called said told her, 'Something very bad had happened to the baby,' Chitwood told the Delaware County Daily Times reports. It was then that she phoned police. Police . believe that Rushdi had beaten the infant just days before. Miss Gaal . said she wanted to take Hamza to the hospital to have his shoulder . examine, but Rusdhi and his family convinced her to treat the child at . home instead.",

Toure and new City striker Wilfried Bony have just helped Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations. \u2018We don\u2019t want both of them to come back so quickly because it is impossible for them to play on Wednesday (against Stoke),' said Pellegrini. 'After that we have 10 days without a game so they have time to come back.\u2019 VIDEO Scroll down to watch Yaya Toure: Winning with your country is exceptional . Yaya Toure helped the Ivory Coast win the Africa Cup of Nations by leading them to victory against Ghana . Manchester City have failed to impress during Toure's spell away from the club .

Everton 1-1 Manchester City . Manchester City 0-2 Arsenal . Manchester City 0-2 Middlesbrough (FA Cup) Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City . Manchester City 1-1 Hull . Manchester City have lost an incredible amount of ground on league leaders Chelsea as Pellegrini's side have struggled to collect maximum points when the Ivorian powerhouse is unavailable for selection. In fact, Manchester City have not won a Barclays Premier League match without Toure since their 3-1 victory against West Brom in March 2014. City have managed to claim important Champions League wins against Bayern Munich and Roma without Toure, but their talisman seems to be an integral component when it comes to competing in the Premier League. Wilfried Bony (centre) will also miss his new side's Premier League clash against Stoke City . Premier League leaders Chelsea have capitalised on Toure's absence by racing into a seven-point lead . Manchester City managed to go on an 11-match unbeaten run in the Premier League before Toure jetted out to Africa. The 31-year-old missed just one of those 11 games as he was rested for the visit of Burnley on December 28. Pellegrini's side have drawn with Everton, Manchester City and Hull, lost to Arsenal and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Middlesbrough in January. The Premier League champions were level on points with Chelsea after 20 games before Toure's departure, four games later and they are now seven points behind Jose Mourinho's side. Throwing the recently-crowned Africa Cup of Nations champion Toure and his team-mate Bony straight back into the fold would be a major gamble, but it may just be a risk worth taking given City's reliance on the former Barcelona star.",

        "article": "Arsene Wenger is not given to tub-thumping, so when he steps out of character, we do well to listen. \u2018When you look at the top-quality players that come into the Premier League, we have all the best attacking players in Europe here,\u2019 he said last week. \u2018The big clubs here have huge financial potential and offensive power. All the best players play here.\u2019 As the point sinks in, you find yourself ticking lists: Manchester United have signed Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to play alongside Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Chelsea have bought the prolific Diego Costa, Liverpool secured the tempestuous Mario Balotelli to contest his place with Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert, Arsenal have signed Alexis Sanchez, while Manchester City gladly settled for Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero, who may just be the best of the lot. The presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar  in Barcelona, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo in Madrid, tends to mock Wenger\u2019s boast that \u2018all the best players play here\u2019. Chelsea's Diego Costa is one of the many top-class strikers plying their trade in the Premier League . But Vincent Kompany aside, there are barely any world-class centre backs currently playing  in England . No matter, that collection of strikers is probably as good as it gets. Yet while it is relatively easy to reel off the names of genuinely gifted goalscorers in the Premier League, the list of similarly accomplished central defenders may be scribbled on the back of a stamp. There is Vincent Kompany at City and, potentially, Dejan Lovren, Liverpool\u2019s signing from Southampton. United and Arsenal have nobody of real note, while Chelsea\u2019s most plausible candidate is the battle-worn John Terry. The fact that Terry is still England\u2019s most formidable centre-half says everything about the current state of English central defenders. Yet this is a nation which down the decades has produced more than its share of gifted defenders. A top-of-the-head trawl turns up Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Tony Adams, Mark Wright, Brian Clough\u2019s sublime alliance of Roy McFarland and Colin Todd, all the way back to the blessed Bobby Moore, who virtually invented the art. The days have gone when our senior division can offer hugely accomplished Scots and Irish defenders, after the fashion of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, while United would gladly hurl scores of their untold millions at a young Nemanja Vidic. But they are not to be had, neither for love nor for money, at home or abroad. The recent World Cup demonstrated just how bare is football\u2019s cupboard. The fact that 33-year-old John Terry is still far and away England's best defender shows there isn't much talent coming through . On the flight home from Brazil, I met a Premier League manager, a man who is a considerable authority on the world game. I asked him what he had made of the tournament. \u2018Nobody knows how to defend,\u2019 he said. \u2018The best players in the world and you can\u2019t see a defender. They don\u2019t exist, it seems.\u2019 So how had such a situation developed? An eloquent shrug. \u2018You tell me,\u2019 he said. \u2018Cos I don\u2019t have a clue.\u2019 His honesty was commendable, his conclusion depressing. Because the game\u2019s inability to produce distinguished defenders is more than a mere quirk. It produces a distorted sense of the game\u2019s values. The best strikers are football\u2019s Flash Harrys; hugely paid and greatly feted. They are the darlings of the television directors, the names the crowds sing, the idols of starry-eyed children who dream of the glory which accompanies the goals. But if those goals arrive too easily, then it follows that the attackers\u2019 qualities are marginally invalidated. And the signs suggest that the inadequacy of defenders is now an accepted fact. Consider the following statistic: in  2013-14, after five Premier League games, a total of 107 goals had been scored. This year, after five games, the total stands at 143. Arsene Wenger said there are many strars in the Premier League, but almost none of them are defenders . Now some will see this as a cause for celebration; the TV directors I mentioned and the people charged with negotiating the next Premier League television contract. But the game\u2019s essential balance has been disturbed. Just as there is more to cricket than a series of sixes, more to golf than the ability to blast a drive for 300 yards, then there is much more to football than a furious flood of cheap goals. But that flood will not be stemmed until the game rediscovers the art of competent defending. Wenger\u2019s instincts are admirable. The attackers he cited are faithful symbols of his philosophy. On those days when the passing game flows and the chances are generated in thrilling profusion, Arsenal are probably the most attractive team in all of England. But offer him a Vidic, a Hansen, another Adams, and he would sell the grandstand for his signature. Because then he would discover, beyond doubt or question, the true worth of the best attacking players in Europe. Ham acting like this is Frankly just laughable . Frank Lampard wore the look of a man who had just done something unforgivable. His beaming colleagues came bouncing to his side but he responded with firmly polite rejection. At such a moment he needed time to be alone, time to come to terms with his shame. It was the stuff of Victorian melodrama. Indeed, you would have needed a heart of stone to keep from laughing out loud. For Lampard was observing the most fatuous convention in modern football. He was ostentatiously refusing to celebrate the goal he had just scored, on the grounds that he had scored it against his former club. Frank Lampard's non-celebration when he scored for Manchester City against Chelsea was nauseating . The entire exercise reeked of calculation, as it always does. The City fans would be so cheered by the goal that they would overlook the absence of celebration. The Chelsea fans would see the stricken face of their old favourite and tell themselves: \u2018Dear old Frank\u2019s still one of us\u2019. Yet the fact is that Lampard is now employed by Manchester City. They pay his wages. He joined them because Chelsea decided that they no longer needed him. That\u2019s how professional football works, as Lampard knows full well. Nobody was expecting extravagant, knee-sliding glee last weekend, just a simple recognition that he had done his job. The counterfeit remorse convinced nobody but the terminally gullible. A yellow card for simulation should greet the next player to pull the stunt. Ham acting deserves no less. Insipid Geoff Thompson rewarded by Sepp Blatter . FIFA have rejected calls to publish their own report into alleged corruption in the bidding for the World Cups of 2018 and 2022. Having commissioned the report, Sepp Blatter has discovered it was telling uncomfortable truths. Enforced silence was his predictable response. In a busy week, it offered a brief distraction from his efforts to organise his fifth term as FIFA president. Yet there was one matter which almost sneaked past the public gaze. FIFA decided to ban the third-party ownership of players. Former FA chairman Geoff Thompson endorsed Sepp Blatter\u00a0for his current presidential term . So they set up a working party. And who is to be chair? I give you Mr Geoff Thompson, former chairman of our own FA. In nine years as FA chairman, he never cast a shadow. Indeed, there were those who seriously doubted his very existence. But he did sign a letter endorsing Blatter for his current presidential term and, in Sepp\u2019s world, no sycophantic deed goes unrewarded. So Thompson heads working parties, where he will rock no boats, drop no bricks and say nothing because he has nothing to say. In short, he is innocuous, insipid and practically invisible; Inaction Man to the life. Mark my words, our Geoff could go a long way in FIFA. P.S. A reporter from The Independent newspaper met the Newcastle owner Mike Ashley outside a London pub. Ashley offered this assessment of Alan Pardew\u2019s career prospects: \u2018Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that\u2019s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it has cost me a lot. I won\u2019t put up with it any more.\u2019 Later, Ashley\u2019s lawyers \u2018interpreted\u2019 the remarks. They used the term \u2018tongue in cheek\u2019. They explained that Ashley was \u2018humouring\u2019 the reporter. You will form your own conclusion. I know which version I believe. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley denied he was being serious in saying manager Alan Pardew could lose his job . Like our Manchester United Facebook page here. Like our Arsenal Facebook page here.",

        "article": "Dan Harris: The cyclist was described as having a 'warmth and passion for life' A cyclist killed by an Olympic bus took to the roads only because he feared the Games would cause public transport chaos. Dan Harris, 28, was dragged under the wheels of a double-decker at a notorious junction in the shadow of the velodrome at the Olympic Park. The internet consultant began commuting on his racing bike a week earlier after telling friends he was fed up with delayed trains. He was the tenth cyclist to die in the capital this year despite millions of pounds being ploughed into making the roads safer. The tragedy came just hours after Bradley Wiggins raced to victory and said he hoped his achievement would encourage more to take up the sport. But after learning of the death, the gold medallist reignited the debate over the safety of cycling in cities. He said the Government should make helmets compulsory and road users should \u2018give and take\u2019. He added: \u2018London is a busy city and there\u2019s a lot of traffic. It\u2019s got a lot busier since I was riding a bike as a kid round here, and I got knocked off several times.\u2019 Yesterday an emotional account emerged from a fellow cyclist who was riding alongside Mr Harris, seconds before he was dragged under the bus in Hackney, close to the Olympic Park Velodrome. The eyewitness, who has not revealed their name, posted a message on the Reddit community blog detailing the tragic moment they saw the accident. The post read: 'The lights changed as he was in the buses blind spot and as he was attempting to go straight the bus turned left. He didn't really have anywhere to go and no time to do anything anyway.' Scroll down for video . Probe: The bus driver, in his sixties, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after a 28-year-old cyclist died in this fatal collision . 'Make helmets compulsory': Bradley Wiggins calls for an overhaul of road safety laws after a cyclist was killed by an Olympics coach close to the Velodrome just hours after he won gold in the time trials yesterday . Shocking: The accident occurred outside the Olympic Park, in Hackney, close to the Games' Velodrome, hockey pitch and Paralympics' tennis arena, as foreign journalists were being transported to another venue . The death toll for cyclists killed in the UK is at least 60 after the death of the 28-year-old man last night. 11 of these occured last month. Among them was Kyle Coen, 14, who was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Kent on Monday when he was cycling to meet his girlfriend. Another teenager was killed last week. Kadian Harding, 14, was hit by a Mercedes Sprinter van when on a family bike ride in Marlborough. Kadian was pronounced dead at the scene after failed attempts from paramedics and his family to rescue him. An inquest was opened on Friday into the teenager's death. No arrest was made of the 32-year-old driver, who suffered from severe shock. Last year 16 cyclists lost their lives in London, and - including the man who was killed yesterday - ten have died on the capital's roads this year. Daniel Cox was hit by a lorry in Dalston, and died at the Royal London Hospital. The message continues: 'As soon as the . bus was definitely stopped i crawled under to him from the other side . and i was immediately aware that i didn't think he'd make it.' The . poster then describes how they crawled up to the collision victim and . comforted him, adding: 'I asked him his name and told him he was going . to be alright. He didn't say anything because i don't think he could, . but he looked straight at me. 'I . did my best to look him straight in the eyes and tell him he was going . to be ok. He was so afraid. Maybe half a minute later i could tell he'd . passed.' Mr Harris was on . his way home to Wanstead, East London, when he was crushed by an . official bus ferrying media around the outskirts of the Olympic Park on . Wednesday evening. Another . cyclist rushed to his aid, but the IT worker, who had recently moved in . with his long-term girlfriend, died at the scene. Campaigners . said the junction on the A12, in Stratford, was \u2018badly designed\u2019 and . criticised the closure of a safer canal towpath during the Games for . \u2018security reasons\u2019. The bus driver, a 65-year-old man, was arrested and . questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving before . being released on bail. Mr . Harris\u2019s Italian girlfriend, advertising worker Cecilia Dominici, was . too upset to speak as she was comforted by friends yesterday. She posted a picture of herself with her boyfriend online with the words: \u2018More than anything in this world.\u2019 Damaged: The man's bike lies mangled next to the Olympic bus which hi collided with . Tragedy: An officer stands watch near the scene of the crash, which happened as Wiggins was preparing to speak at a press conference at the Olympic Park . Safety call: Wiggins said the Government should be 'legalising helmets to make them the law to wear' as he he admitted he had been knocked off his bike on London\u00bfs 'dangerous' streets . Mr . Harris\u2019s employer, Moo.com, said: \u2018There are no words to express how . much we\u2019ll all miss him, and his infectious enthusiasm, warmth and . passion for life.\u2019 It is . not known if Mr Harris was wearing a helmet, but last night David . Cameron said making them compulsory was under review. He said: \u2018It\u2019s a . difficult issue. 'There is a strong case for making them compulsory but . when this was last looked at the decision was made not to do that . because there are some who take a different view, that it would . discourage cycling and it wouldn\u2019t reduce the level of accidents.\u2019 Rescuers and police stand at the scene after Dan Harris was killed after colliding with the bus . There was a heavy police presence after the accident . Winner: Wiggins took gold yesterday in the cycling time trial event, becoming Great Britain's most successful ever Olympian .

        "article": "James Bond has seen off countless dastardly villains in his time \u2013 but he might have met his match in North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. For the leader of the communist regime is believed to be behind the leaking online of a working draft of the script for the next 007 film. And he is also thought to be responsible for the revelation of a number of embarrassing emails which show producers\u2019 scathing criticisms of the \u00a3190 million production. Scroll down for video . A draft script for the next 007 film, featuring Daniel Craig and his co-stars Lea Seydoux, left, and Monica Bellucci, right, is believed to have been hacked by the regime of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un . One of the leaked emails from a Hollywood executive criticising the movie and seeking more of a 'twist' In one withering leaked put-down, MGM film division president Jonathan Glickman says of the finale in the script: \u2018You guys set me up for a let-down on the climax. So I was not surprised.\u2019 (L to R) Andrew Scott, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, director Sam Mendes, Lea Seydoux, Craig, (middle) Monica Bellucci, Christoph Waltz, Ben Whishaw, Dave Bautista and Rory Kinnear . James Bond 'Spectre' film photocall, London . Craig and his co-star Miss Bellucci pose for pictures at the 'Spectre' film premiere in London . Complicated role: Newcomer Andrew Scott will also have a very pivotal and interesting roll in the new movie . The leak followed a cyber-attack on Sony Studios, which is making the film with MGM. Other emails put online by the attackers have already caused huge embarrassment in Hollywood. Filming of Spectre, the 24th movie in the James Bond series, began last week, with Daniel Craig returning as 007. He will star alongside Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux. Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz also stars, and is believed to be playing Ernst Blofeld, Bond\u2019s iconic nemesis who is set to return decades after his last appearance. But while there\u2019s huge anticipation surrounding the follow-up movie to Skyfall, behind the scenes studio executives have said the script is a huge disappointment, and have complained that writers have \u2018wasted\u2019 Blofeld\u2019s return. In one withering put-down, MGM film division president Jonathan Glickman says of the finale in the script: \u2018You guys set me up for a let-down on the climax. So I was not surprised.\u2019 It has been revealed that Glickman is disappointed by the entire premise of the story, in which Bond battles Spectre after the evil organisation takes over a number of Western spy agencies. He writes of Spectre\u2019s plan, as portrayed in the film: \u2018They should need the combined resources of all the intelligence agencies to pull it off. Surely there is something more pressing than suppressing one document.\u2019 Kim is believed to be behind the leaking online of a working draft of the script for the next 007 film and a number of embarrassing emails which show producers\u2019 scathing criticisms of the \u00a3190 million production . The leaked notes also reveal dismay that the return of arch-villain Blofeld \u2013 famous for stroking his white cat \u2013 is being thrown away. Referring to scenes that seemingly fail to pass muster, one studio executive writes: \u2018Also, there needs to be some kind of a twist rather than a series of watery chases with guns. This is Blofeld after all. What does he have up his sleeve?\u2019 In another fierce barb, a producer says of the climax: \u2018We need to cut 20 pages and this whole set-piece could go.\u2019 Sony producer Elizabeth Cantillon responds to the script by writing \u2018rough, rough, rough\u2019 and complains of the end of the film: \u2018Bond is simply fighting henchmen in many overblown and familiar sequences \u2013 helicopter, elevator shaft, netting.\u2019 The leaked version of the script has Bond destroying part of Mexico City during a rogue operation and facing forced retirement as MI6 merges with MI5. Bellucci, who at 50 is the oldest Bond girl, plays the wife of a man Bond assassinates. Director Sam Mendes is likely to have been left in a fury by the leaking of the script, which has been worked on extensively by several writers, including Neal Purvis and Robert Wade \u2013 who authored Skyfall \u2013 and acclaimed British playwright Jez Butterworth. One Hollywood insider told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018The script is still being worked on, even though filming has started. There has been a lot of concern that the script isn\u2019t up to par. Very few people working on the film have seen a complete version because it\u2019s simply not ready.\u2019 Hollywood has been in uproar over the massive cyber-attack on Sony. Hackers calling themselves the Guardians of Peace said they infiltrated the company\u2019s computers in retaliation for the release of the film The Interview, which will reach US cinemas over Christmas and Britain in February. Made by Sony and starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, the comedy features the assassination of Kim Jong-un, whose head is seen to \u2018explode\u2019. North Korea has denied being behind the leaks but called the hack \u2018a righteous deed\u2019. Spectre is scheduled to hit the big screens in November next year.",

        "article": "'Nincompoop': Ramesh Tawadkar  announced that Goa intends to set up centres to 'cure' homosexuals . An Indian state minister has announced plans to open treatment centres for the LGBT community to 'make them normal', comparing homosexuals to alcoholics. Ramesh Tawadkar, Goa's minister for sport and youth, said the government in the popular tourist resort would 'cure' homosexuals with 'training and medicines'. Tawadkar, a representative of right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, sparked outrage with the comments, made during a press conference yesterday. 'We will make them normal. We will have centres for them, like Alcoholics Anonymous centres,' Tawadkar said, adding that the Goa government would 'train them and give them medicines too'. Tawadkar made the comments after releasing the Goa state's policy on youth issues which listed the LGBT community as a stigmatised group that needed attention. Bharatiya Janata Party, is the current majority party in India, and is headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Tawadkar's comments drew widespread criticism and ridicule from gay rights groups who branded them offensive, while hostile remarks were posted on Twitter and other social media. Anjali Gopalan, founder of sexual health organisation Naz Foundation,  called minister Tawadkar an 'incompetent nincompoop'. 'We should not respond to this kind of stupidity. If anyone needs treatment, it's people like him... he should realise he sounds like a complete fool,' Gopalan said. Nitin Karani, trustee of the gay rights advocacy group Samapathik Trust, said the minister's comments reflected his ignorance, but at the same time he conceded that the LGBT community needed to 'reach out more to the mainstream for awareness'. Tawadkar's comments came one day after UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay and lesbian relationships. United in support: Members and supporters of the Indian LGBT community march during a Gay Pride Parade in New Delhi in November last year . Speaking on a visit to the capital New Delhi on Monday night, Ban said he 'staunchly opposed the criminalisation of homosexuality'. 'I am proud to stand for the equality of all people -- including those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender,' Ban said in an address to a gathering that included India's Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. Critique:\u00a0UN's Ban Ki-moon accused India of fostering intolerance with its laws against gay sex . 'I speak out because laws criminalising consensual, adult same-sex relationships violate basic rights to privacy and to freedom from discrimination. 'Even if they are not enforced, these laws breed intolerance.' India's Supreme Court reimposed a ban on gay sex in late 2013, ruling that responsibility for changing the 1861 law rested with lawmakers and not judges. Gay sex had been effectively legalised in 2009 when the Delhi High Court ruled that banning 'carnal intercourse against the order of nature' was a violation of fundamental rights. Members of the gay community have filed petitions to the top court since the 2013 ruling asking for a review on criminalising gay sex. Campaigners say the law is rarely used to prosecute homosexual acts, but add that police do use it to harass and blackmail members of their already marginalised community. Surveys show broad disapproval of homosexuality in India, forcing many gay men and women to live double lives. Hindu hardliners have often called same-sex relationships a disease and a Western cultural import. Popular Indian guru Baba Ramdev, who is close to the Bharatiya Janata Party, stirred controversy in 2011 when he said that homosexuality could be 'cured' through yoga.",

The move could reduce the number of \u2018red cards\u2019 which land on doormats to tell householders a package has been returned to the delivery office. Postmen already attempt to deliver parcels to people\u2019s neighbours if they are out. But the new service means they can now deliver to a specific friend who lives nearby, in the recipient\u2019s absence. Residents can now nominate a neighbour to receive their parcels so they never miss a delivery, Royal Mail announced yesterday (file picture) It means people can choose a neighbour who they know well, or who is often in during the day, to sign for a parcel or receive a delivery which will not fit through the letter box. The price of first and second class stamps rose by a penny each yesterday. A first class stamp now costs 63p while second class is 54p \u2013 more than double what it was ten years ago. Sending a large letter has gone up by 2p to 95p for first class and by 1p to 74p for second class. Royal Mail, which was privatised in 2013, said it had \u2018thought carefully about the impact on customers\u2019 because of \u2018recent tough economic conditions\u2019. However critics fear the increase will hit small businesses which depend on the postal service. The price rise is 1.6 per cent for a first class stamp, and 1.9 per cent for second class. John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u2018If you\u2019re a business that relies heavily on the postal service, increases in prices won\u2019t be welcomed. \u2018Businesses affected will have to decide whether to absorb it or pass it on to their customers.\u2019 Royal Mail said the \u2018Nominate a Neighbour\u2019 scheme would be more convenient for householders and \u2018improve first-time delivery\u2019. Sue Whalley, of Royal Mail, said: \u2018This new initiative is great news for our customers as it offers further choice and convenience if there is no one at home. \u2018For our postmen and women it means that they are even more likely to deliver parcels and letters first time rather than having to take items back to the office. First-time delivery of parcels and signed-for items is high in Royal Mail and in the trial delivery offices this improved further.\u2019 Since 2012 Royal Mail has left parcels with neighbours if the recipient is not in. But critics feared this meant valuable packages could be left with untrustworthy or unfamiliar neighbours. Now customers can nominate a preferred neighbour by visiting their local delivery office, filling out a short form and presenting proof of their identity. Postmen will try to deliver to this neighbour in the first instance, before trying other addresses nearby. It is unclear if using the nominate service, however, will mean that households are now responsible if their parcel then goes missing. Under the old system, when postmen knocked on several neighbours\u2019 doors, Royal Mail was still responsible if the parcel later went astray. Special delivery items and international parcels requiring a signature are excluded from the scheme.",

        "article": "From the bright lights and constant clattering of a tenpin bowling alley to the calmness of a fine art workshop, it has been quite the career change for Peter Bellerby. A few years ago, the 48-year-old was working as the boss of a tenpin bowling business. Now he is crafting a beautiful array of bespoke globes which sell up to \u00a359,000 a time. His artisan globe company which has A-list . clients from all over the world, one of whom has already paid full price . for a 'Churchill globe' mounted on an aircraft engine replica made by the heritage technicians at Aston Martin. Labour of love: Peter Bellerby, 48, and his team built the contents of this stunning workshop from scratch after he attempted to create a homemade globe for his father . Painstaking: The papering and painting processes take the longest to learn according to Mr Ballerby. He says a trainee will take the best part of a year to learn the skill . Gentle: The sections of paper are soaking wet when applied meaning even the slightest tension can cause a rip, forcing the craftsman to start again . Mr Bellerby, founder of Bellerby & . Co, was working as the boss of a bowling alley business six years ago . when he made his first globe for his father's 80th birthday. It was the lack of well crafted globes . on the market which forced the maker's hand. According to Mr Bellerby, he . wanted a globe which wasn't a 'cheap mass produced item, but also wasn't . a 500 year old antique. The self-starting craftsman decided . that he would make his own, and after 18 months of what he said was . 'frustration and concentration' his first globe and his new business was . born. Speaking from the . studio in Stoke Newington, Mr Bellerby said the process of learning to . make globes had been more about persistence than talent. He . said: 'I knew I wanted to get my father something different for his . birthday, and a globe was just an idea I was toying with. In fact, to . begin with I was thinking about making us one each, that was obviously . before I knew anything about the work which is involved.' After . 18 months of toil, and with his first far from perfect globe under his . belt, Mr Bellerby decided he would begin making more models to cater for . what he saw as a gap in the market. But . according to the modest businessman, the transition from part time . hobbyist to full time craftsman was more to do with persistence than . innate talent. He said: 'I . couldn't claim to be a natural, that's for sure. When it comes to making . globes I'm not sure that there are any naturals it's all about hard . work and repetition. 'That's . why I had to stay in the business really, I'd put some money into the . venture and I knew that the only was it would be a success would be to . push and keep making these things until they became the products they . are today.' Range: Bellerby and Co produce a range of different sized globes all to specification. The Churchill globe, seen here mounted on a solid oak base, costs from \u00a339,000 . Team effort: Ballerby & Co employ specially trained artists to help with the production and application of the maps in their Stoke Newington studio . Bellerby's . first lesson to learn, one vital to making a proper globe, was how craft . a truly round sphere which could then be covered in a map. Explaining . his first attempts as trying, the entrepreneur has since come to rely . on some state of the are technology to make the base for his balls. He . said: 'My first attempts were made of plaster of Paris using . mathematical instruments, what you quickly learn is that the margin for . error is tiny and so much can go wrong. 'Every time you mess up a measurement, you're essentially multiplying that by Pi by the time you're finishing the shape. 'Nowadays . we use resin which is shaped using F1 fabricators to help us build the . molds. We have a very high degree of accuracy now.' One . the shape is complete, there comes the painstaking process of applying . the maps. Something, yet again, Mr Bellery says that there is no quick . trick to. Technique: The smaller globes, left, are made from solid granite which can weigh up to 2kgs while bigger versions are hollow and covered with paper segments, right . He said: 'I have a . trainee at the moment who has been with me for a few months learning to . paper the globe, it will probably be another five until she does her . first perfect one. 'The . papering process is long and requires complete concentration. The paper . is wet so it will take the shape of the globe properly, but that makes . it very fragile. 'At times . there will be five of us papering away on a big project and there won't . be a word shared between us, you just can't take your eye off it'. Bellerby's . maps are alterations of other cartographers' works.The entrepreneur . says he simply does not have to the staff or time to run a cartography . business too, but the decorations on his globe's have made them highly . desirable. Modestly, Mr Bellerby will not be drawn on the household names who adorn their homes with his creations. He . said: 'It's true that we have customers who your reader will have heard . of, but they're no more important than my other customers, so I don't . like to single them out. Quality assured: According to Mr Bellerby,\u00a0 his workshop operates a quality over quantity policy, he insists it would be impossible to 'churn out' his bespoke globes . 'Let's just say a few of my customers have their own wikipedia pages.You can work it out from that, can't you?' Estimating . that his workshop will turn out around 200 globes this year, the . craftsman says his focus remains on quality and not quantity, adding: . 'I've never had anyone come back to me to say, your globe is broke, or . scratched or misshapen... or just not good enough. 'The . thought of that makes me feel really, really bad. I suppose that's our . driving force really, it keeps my commitment to quality, anyway. Leader: Peter Bellerby, right poses with the base of a sphere ready for covering in the magnificent studio. Before globes, he spent his days as a bowling alley manager .",

        "article": "New York (CNN) -- A jury has begun deliberating in the case of a Pakistani scientist accused of trying to kill U.S. officers. The jury began deliberating Monday in the trial of Aafia Siddiqui, who is charged with attempted murder and assault for allegedly shooting at U.S. officers while she was in Afghan custody. She allegedly shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. Authorities said Siddiqui was behind a curtain and fired two shots at the personnel with an officer's rifle, hitting no one. The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol, hitting Siddiqui at least once . Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor's compound after finding her with bomb-making instructions, excerpts from the \"Anarchist's Arsenal,\" papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks, and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars, according to a September 2008 indictment. The indictment said Siddiqui had \"handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack'\" listing several locations in the United States, and \"construction of 'dirty bombs.'\" The notes also \"discussed various ways to attack 'enemies,' including by destroying reconnaissance drones, using underwater bombs, and using gliders,\" the indictment said. \"Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific 'cells,' 'attacks' by certain 'cells,' and 'enemies,'\" the indictment said. \"Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training.\" Siddiqui -- whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda -- was extradited to the United States in August 2008. Since 2003, the whereabouts of Siddiqui -- an American-educated neuroscientist -- had been the source of much speculation. According to Amnesty International, Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi, Pakistan, in March 2003, shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location. Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. But in May 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members.",

        "article": "By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 2 January 2012 . Surfing will try to wipe out drug cheats with a radical move to bring in comprehensive testing for the first time. The sport's international governing body, the Association of Surfing Professionals,  will roll out a policy for screening competitors this year. Surfing has long been associated with 1960s and 70s counter culture and the recreational use of marijuana and LSD. Surfer Andy Irons died from a heart attack with traces of crystal meth, methadone and cocaine in his blood . But now the sport is cracking down on its growing culture of performance enhancing drugs at its top level. It comes after the death of the triple world champion Andy Irons, from Hawaii, in November 2010. A postmortem found he died from a heart attack and 'acute mixed drug ingestion'. Traces of methadone, methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, and a metabolite of cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Another professional surfer, Anthony Ruffo, a 47-year-old pioneer of the Santa Cruz scene in the 1980s, is facing a possible jail sentence for selling methamphetamine after he was caught with an ounce of the drug. ASP spokesman Dave Prodan told the Guardian: 'We believe this is a natural evolution in enhancing the professionalism of our sport.' Former world champion Andy Irons, of Hawaii, pictured holding up three fingers to the crowds as he claimed his third world championship title at the Nova Schin Festival at Imbituba, Brazil . Neco Padaratz (centre), who was suspended after he tested positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids, ride out on the world's longest surfboard in 2005 . He added that the ASP have been in discussions over regulations with the World Anti Doping Agency for more than two years. Professional . surfers compete for prizes of up to $100,000 (\u00a365,000) and testing is . already carried out at some European events and in the UK and Ireland. In 2005, the Brazilian surfer Neco Padaratz was suspended after he tested positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids at an event in Hossegor on the French Atlantic coast. Peter Davi, a pioneering big wave surfer, was found to have high levels of methamphetaine in his blood after he died in December 2007 riding a 20m wave off California. He sustained head and chest injuries, probably from being dashed against jagged rocks. Gerry Fitzgerald, a professional in Ireland, said that for most surfers, the idea of taking drugs before tackling dangerous waves was anathema. 'I have seen guys who are stoners and they drop off the scene because it is not sustainable,' he said. 'Athletes are training hard. The way the contests are now, it will catch up with you.' Pancho Sullivan, a professional surfer from Hawaii said he supported the new testing regime despite a tradition of recreational drug use in the sport.",

Children were among the dead, officials said. A bomb Thursday morning in a vehicle near a security checkpoint in the center of town caused the first explosion, which wrecked a marketplace, destroyed eight security vehicles and claimed at least 12 lives, police spokesman Wazir Khan Nasir said. At least another 45 people were wounded there. Nasir said he believed the checkpoint was the target of the attack. More on Pakistan: India and Pakistan trade accusations over Kashmir violence . Nearby, twin blasts during the evening killed at least 81 people and wounded 121, Chief Capital City Police Officer Miz Zubair Mehmood told CNN. The second of the two explosions erupted when police and reporters arrived at the scene of the first blast. A videographer for a private television network was among the dead. Nine of the dead were security officers, Mehmood said. \"The government of Baluchistan is working on mitigating security concerns, and we will make sure to protect citizens as best we can,\" Mehmood said. A fourth blast wounded three people. The cause of the blasts was not known, and no one had claimed responsibility for them, he said. Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf condemned the blasts. \"The prime minister, while expressing his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the bereaved families, reiterated the government's resolve to stamp out the menace of militancy and terrorism from the country in its all shapes and manifestations,\" his office said in a statement. \"He said that such cowardly acts would not deter the government from fighting the menace of terrorism.\"",

        "article": "A high school teacher, 41, resigned from his job and left his family so he could move in with a former student, now 18, he is having a relationship with. Enochs Hugh School teacher James Hooker quit his job after going public about his relationship with Jordan Powers from Modesto, California. Police are now investigating to discern whether or not something inappropriate or illegal took place before she turned 18. Since then, the teen's mother has waged a public campaign on Facebook after her daughter moved out of their home. She is alleging Mr Hooker actively pursued her daughter when she was underage and said his actions are tantamount to abuse. Forbidden Love: Jordan Powers, 18, left, is now living with her former teacher James Hooker, 41, right, who she says is 'more than just a lover, but a best friend as well' Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where his daughter, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan . The 41-year-old left his wife and children - one of whom is a year younger than Jordan and went to the same school - to move into an apartment with his teenage lover. Mr Hooker was placed on administrative leave on February 3 by Modesto High Schools before resigning a few weeks later. Mother Tammie Powers has launched an aggressive Facebook campaign against Hooker who she calls a 'sick child molester' He taught business and IT as well as running several after-school clubs, one of which Jordan was a member. Speaking to the Sacramento Bee, he said: 'In making our choice, we've hurt a lot of people. We keep asking ourselves, \"Do we make everyone else happy or do we follow our hearts?\"' Jordan's mother Tammie Powers is blaming Mr Hooker for pursuing her daughter and taking advantage of her. She claims her daughter's grades fell this year and she started to have panic attacks 'from the stress'. She said Jordan was always a good and 'compliant' daughter. She told The Bee: 'I was really, really careful. I wanted her to be safe. In hindsight, in retrospect, I should have looked at things differently. 'She looked up to him. He was in the position of an educator, you don\u2019t . abuse your student. Period. 'She\u2019s still in high school. She still lives . at home. She has a curfew. That\u2019s not OK.' Jordan has now stopped attending classes at the school and is doing independent study. She and Mr Hooker both maintain they only got together once she turned 18 and their feelings blossomed as they spent time together during and after school. True Love: The couple maintain their feelings for each other blossomed slowly by spending time together during and after school, and then via phone calls and text messages . Love nest: Hooker left his wife and children to move into one of these apartments with Jordan - 23 years his junior . 'He's my best friend', she told ABC. 'I mean, he's more than just a lover.' On Tannie Powers' Facebook account, she posts a picture of James Hooker with this message: . 'This is a picture of JAMES HOOKER from . Enochs High School....a perverted man in his forties, who has taken . advantage of a little girl. 'Now, James if you're reading this while you . have my daughter, you better believe everyone will know you're a sick . child molester. 'Don't . think for one second you will win. I'm smarter, stronger, and . way more determined. I WILL NEVER give up. 'I'll be getting my daughter back you . sicko.' The former teacher said he felt nothing for the teen when she was in his business class. 'She was just a student,' he said. 'There was no attraction. There was nothing that was out of the ordinary, as opposed to any other student.\u00a0 We were very much a teacher-student role.' Mrs Powers does not believe these claims. She discovered up to 8,000 text messages exchanged between them, emails and late night phone calls. She has now even started a Facebook campaign against Hooker, calling him a 'sicko' and a 'pervert' Mr Hooker said, though he is being investigated, he is confident that he will be cleared of any inappropriate behaviour, but said he can see why people would be alarmed. He told ABC: 'I think the stigma of the teacher-student relationship just makes it messy, makes it really hard for people to get through to the point that we really do like each other. 'We really do want to have a future together.'",

        "article": "By . Beth Stebner . PUBLISHED: . 07:55 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:55 EST, 17 October 2012 . Five people were found dead inside an east Denver bar by firefighters responding to an early-morning fire, authorities said. Police are calling the blaze an arson-homicide. Denver Police Chief Robert White says the fire at Fero's Bar & Grill in east Denver was reported at about 2am Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Horrific discovery: The bodies of a man and four woman were discovered at Fero's Bar & Grill in Denver after firefighters extinguished a fire at the bar early Wednesday morning . Investigation: Authorities continue to look into the crime scene; they believe that the victims were killed before the blaze began . Speaking at an impromptu early-morning news conference, Chief White said that the four women and a man also appeared to have suffered other injuries. \u2018It appears there was some trauma to the bodies, it also appears to be arson,\u2019 he said, according to the Denver Post. He added did not know if the deaths occurred before or after the bar was closed. Denver Police Commander Ronald Saunier said that the victims were likely killed before the fire was started. He said that the bodies had visible signs of trauma, but would not go into detail over the victims' injuries. 'The business has obviously been set on fire, an arson, I'm guessing, to mask the homicide that occurred inside,' Mr Saunier said. 'There is just trauma, enough information to believe that we have a homicide that occurred here. They didn't perish in the fire.' Grisly: Police said they believe the victims were killed before the fire was started, calling it an arson-homicide . The bar is located in a strip mall about five miles south of downtown Denver just outside of the tony Cherry Creek North shopping district on one of the city's busiest streets, Colorado Boulevard. In listings in Denver's alternative weekly, Westword, Fero's is described as a 'longstanding dive' that attracts regulars as well as people staying in nearby hotels. It shares the strip mall with a check cashing store and a car repair shop. The bar's owners couldn't immediately be reached for comment. No one answered the door at the Aurora home of Young Fero, listed in state records as one of the owners of the bar. A sign on the door read, 'Day sleeper, please don't ring the doorbell! Thank you.' It was signed 'The sleeper,' the Associated Press reported. Neighbour Mike Spinale described Fero as 'really nice.' 'She didn't speak much, but I know she owned a bar and she worked all the time,' Mr Spinale told AP. 'She told me she did everything herself.' Location: Fero's Bar & Grill is located in a shopping complex next to a check cashing business . After sunrise, residents in a neighbouring apartment building were out walking their dogs as police looked in trash bins and checked out cars parked outside. The five dead are believed to be the only ones in the bar when the fire started - other than whoever is responsible for their deaths -so police are asking anyone else who was at the place earlier to come forward, as investigators try to piece together what happened. The victims haven't been identified. Autopsies were expected to be conducted later in the day. Frank Peluso, who works in an office building a half block away, said he used to eat lunch at the bar but hasn't been there in three years. He said it seemed to be declining and the owners have tried various things to attract more business, including offering karaoke. 'It's one of those places that you wonder how it stays in business,' Mr Peluso said. Resident Matthew Neam said you can't see into the bar because the front windows are frosted. He said he and his friend used to joke about what might be inside. 'I've never gone in there. It always looked kind of sketchy to me,' Mr Neam said.",

The Football Association will wait for referee Andre Marriner\u2019s report before deciding whether to launch an investigation into crowd control after other missiles rained down on the Loftus Road pitch. QPR manager Chris Ramsey condemned the behaviour. \u2018We don\u2019t want any objects thrown on the pitch,\u2019 he said. \u2018Hostilities between fans can go too far. If that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll encourage them not to come back.\u2019 Jubilant Chelsea celebrations were marred by objects being thrown onto the pitch by the crowd . Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic hands over a coin to referee Andre Marriner during the match on Sunday . Jose Mourinho, who admitted Chelsea \u2018were lucky\u2019, refused to be drawn into the controversy. \u2018The game was correct. Correct on the pitch, correct in the stands. Hopefully correct outside,\u2019 he said. \u2018If somebody throws a pound, put the pound in your pocket and go. If it\u2019s a chocolate, eat it. No problem. \u2018It\u2019s not easy, because emotionally it\u2019s a big game for them and us. The referee also helped, a very stable man who solves, not creates, problems in the game.\u2019 During the Chelsea celebrations at Loftus Road, the Blues were targeted by objects thrown from the crowd . The Loftus Road pitch was covered in litter and objects following the west London derby contest on Sunday . Chelsea duo Nemanja Matic (left) and Branislav Ivanovic react after being struck with objects . Chelsea extended their lead over Arsenal to seven points, with a game in hand, and Mourinho added: \u2018This was a typical game for 0-0. So, obviously, very happy with my team because we kept always good emotional control. We never lost balance, we were not under pressure; if we\u2019d had to go home with a point, we would have.\u2019 Mourinho said Loic Remy should be available for next weekend\u2019s home game with Manchester United after sitting this one out with a calf strain. Meanwhile, Ramsey refused to blame Green for Sunday's loss, despite the goalkeeper's crucial mistake. Cesc Fabregas' low strike, Chelsea's first shot on target, was enough to secure the win at Loftus Road . 'I'm not blaming Robert Green. It wasn't one of his best kicks, but we had a long time to defend that properly and we didn't, for the first time in the game,' said the QPR boss. 'You have to defend it better. Rob is going to be down because he's a top player. We all make mistakes. 'Why didn't we score? That's a mistake in itself. \u2018Rob has been fantastic for this club this season. If he had not been in the form he has been, we wouldn't be anywhere near. I'm hoping he doesn't internalise it as his fault why we lost.' Midfielder Cesc Fabregas runs away in celebration having scored a vital winner in the 88th minute .",

The Premier League leaders could be forgiven for still being in shock after letting slip a 2-0 lead at Stamford Bridge to go out of the FA Cup to League One opposition, but they have little time to dwell on the defeat as Liverpool visit Stamford Bridge on Tuesday in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg. The tie is finely poised at 1-1, with a place in the March 1 final at Wembley at stake. Bradford City manager Phil Parkinson is \u00a0is congratulated by Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge . Former Chelsea player Filipe Morais celerates after scoring his team's equaliser against Chelsea . Mourinho expects a response from his established first-choice players after making nine changes for Bradford's visit and seeing his fringe players disappoint. \"I always said I don't choose competitions, that we go match after match,\" Mourinho said, with his team still well poised in the league and also gearing up for a Champions League last 16 clash against Paris St Germain. \"The most important competition now is the Capital One Cup, because it's the next game we have to play. Bradford City's Irish midfielder Mark Yeates (C) drops to his knees as he celebrates scoring his team's fourth . Andrew Halliday of Bradford City scores his team's third goal past goalkeeper Petr Cech . \"Obviously the Premier League is in front of the cups, but the way we prepare things - in a serious way, in a professional way - I can't say we don't care about the FA Cup. 'Ah, we lost, I don't care' - I cannot say that. \"We lost and we care. I cannot say more than that. Does this affect the next match? I don't know. \"Because many of the players were not directly involved in the game, I don't think these players can be affected. I don't think (Branislav) Ivanovic, (Nemanja) Matic, Diego (Costa), can be affected by something that is not directly related to them. \"But it's our team and we lost at home against a lower division team.\" Bradford players celebrate following their team's 4-2 victory over Premier League giants Chelsea .",

Cristiano Ronaldo (left) underlines his frustration when Bale missed the target after opting not to pass to him . The former Tottenham winger fires an effort in on goal during Real Madrid's win against Espanyol . The former Tottenham winger could well have been going over what the word for 'pass' translates to in Spanish (pasar) - after being booed by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd when he opted against giving the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo in the win against Espanyol - consequently missing the target. It would be hard for the home faithful to be too critical of Bale following the 3-0 win on Saturday though, with his stunning free-kick doubling the\u00a0Galacticos' lead before the half-time interval. Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo himself has urged the Madrid fans to go easy on Bale, insisting he is a very important part of Carlo Ancelotti's side. Next up for the Spanish giants is the second leg of their last-16 Copa del Rey clash with rivals Atletico Madrid on Thursday, with Ancelotti's side needing to overturn a two-goal deficit to progress.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A Buffalo, New York-area man accused of beheading his estranged wife made his first appearance in court Wednesday to face murder charges, according to the district attorney. Muzzammil Hassan has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of his wife, Aasiya Zubair Hassan. Muzzammil Hassan, 44, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of his 37-year-old wife, Aasiya Zubair Hassan, days after she filed for divorce and was granted a restraining order against him. In court Wednesday, Hassan waived his right to a felony hearing, according to Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita III. The case will go before a grand jury in the next 45 days. In the meantime, Hassan will be jailed without bond. If convicted, he faces a sentence of 15 years to life, WKBW reported, citing prosecutors. Muzzammil Hassan went to the police station in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park on Thursday and told officers that his wife was dead, authorities have said. He also led them to her body at the offices of Bridges TV. The couple began the network in 2004 to counter negative Muslim stereotypes; Muzzammil Hassan is its chief executive officer, and Aasiya Hassan was general manager. Aasiya Hassan filed for divorce February 6, police said, and Muzzammil Hassan was served with divorce papers at the station. That night, he showed up at the couple's home, she notified authorities, and he was served with a restraining order. Police had responded to several domestic violence calls at the couple's address, but no one was arrested, Orchard Park Police Chief Andrew Benz said Tuesday. However, two women claiming to be Aasiya Hassan's sisters -- one in Pakistan and one in South Africa -- told reporters and posted in a blog that she lived in fear of him. Bridges TV released a statement Monday saying its staff members were \"deeply shocked and saddened by the murder of Aasiya Hassan and the subsequent arrest of Muzzammil Hassan. Our deepest condolences and prayers go out to the families of the victim.\"",

        "article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- With Quentin Tarantino's recent disclosure that Brad Pitt \"pulled out a brick of hash\" for the pair to smoke during a meeting about Tarantino's new film \"Inglourious Basterds,\" the two movie icons could today be mistaken for old roomies. Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino have always wanted to work together but couldn't find the right project before \"Inglourious Basterds.\" However, in an interview with CNN, the charismatic director of \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\" insists that the well-anticipated union was a long time in the making. \"It was very much a case of us wanting to work together, but waiting for the right project to come along,\" he told CNN. It has been 16 years since a youthful Pitt featured -- rather fittingly, it seems -- as a stoned layabout in \"True Romance,\" the Tarantino-scripted tale of lovers on the run. Since that time, Tarantino says, \"everybody's been wondering when this great love affair is gonna happen.\" And yet, when Tarantino first approached Brad's representative about another project, the agent was apparently \"too protective\" of the future relationship between the director and his client. \"He told me the last thing he wanted was to put us in the same room and let us fall in love over a movie we wouldn't be able to do.\" A seasoned filmmaker by this time, Tarantino could relate to the points raised by the agent and decided to take a step back and let things happen naturally. He first sensed Pitt could be a strong contender for the role of Aldo Raine, the \"fast-talking, vengeance-driven hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee\" who leads Tarantino's critically-divisive \"Inglourious Basterds,\" when he was half way through writing the script.  From \"Dogs\" to \"Basterds:\" Tarantino's career in pictures \u00bb . At this stage, however, Tarantino was still not entirely convinced Pitt would be the best choice. \"Then, I wrote a little bit more and thought Brad would be terrific. By the time I got towards the end, I felt he would be perfect but became worried I wouldn't get him.\" He quickly made contact with the agent again and explained there was another project in the pipeline. At this point, he was worried Pitt could already be committed for the next few years. Fortunately for the army of Pitt and Tarantino fans around the world, this was not the case. \"His agent said Brad doesn't do that because he wants to be available when good material is offered.\" The rest, as they say, is history. \"It was a lot of fun working with Brad, which wasn't very surprising,\" Tarantino told CNN. \"We had already been told we would get along like a house on fire, and that's pretty much what happened.\" With Tarantino's revelation Tuesday on the Howard Stern Show that he and Brad had got through six bottles of wine and a \"slice of hash\" in one night, Angelina may be one of the few people hoping that this is not the start a beautiful relationship. George Webster contributed to this report .",

Cheng was enjoying the public holiday at the rural spot in Xinyang, at Henan province in central China, when tragedy struck. Heroic: Brave Cheng Changjiang died just moments after this picture was taken. The selfless teenager rushed to save three children from drowning in the lake at the beauty spot in central China . Beauty spot: Cheng, 18, rushed into the water after hearing three children screaming for help. Wang Caihe, 11, fell into the water after trying to help her younger brothers who slipped on wet rocks . Wang Caihe, 11, and her younger brothers, aged six and four, were visiting the lake with their grandmother Wang Zhongyuan, 63. While her back was turned the trio went to the water's edge. But the four-year-old slipped on the wet rocks, dragging his brother with him. When their older sister rushed to help, she also got into difficulty. Cheng, who was the only other person nearby, heard the children's screams. With no thought for his own safety, the teenager - who could not swim - waded into the water, pulling two of the stricken children free from danger. Rescued: Two brothers, aged six and four, who were plucked to safety from the water by Cheng. Despite never learning how to swim the brave teenager rushed to their aid .

I am proud of him but also devastated' By the time he returned to the water to rescue the third child, a local man, Wan Sun, 31, had rushed to help. Sun said: 'He handed me the 11-year-old and I dragged her to the shore, but when I looked for the young man I could not see him. He must have slipped in deeper water. 'When we pulled him from the water he was dead, there was no chance to save his life. 'He gave his life for the children, he was a hero.' Paying tribute to their son, Cheng's parents, said he had gone to the popular spot to relax after getting stressed over his recent exams. Father Ling Wu said: 'It was typical of him.

        "article": "(CNN) -- A single braid down the back, a light hunting jacket, a pair of sturdy leather shoes and a small golden pin; not exactly a culmination of things you would call fashionable. But these are the key accessories to one of the hottest new characters to hit the big screen: Katniss Everdeen. Katniss, the arrow-slinging, tribute-hunting teenager from the upcoming movie \"The Hunger Games,\" based on Suzanne Collins' bestselling book, has made a huge style splash on the Web. Dozens of \"how-to-dress like Katniss\" web pages, blog posts and articles are being bookmarked and pinned up by girls of all ages. But when did hunting gear and cotton dresses become so fashionable? For the same reason the little black dress from Audrey Hepburn's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" is still a staple today: It's not just the look that audiences are responding to, but what that character represents, explains Teen Vogue's News Fashion Editor, Jane Keltner de Valle. In the case of Katniss, \"Hunger Games\" costume designer Judianna Makovsky kept in mind that the character's style had to tell the story of a distinctively strong young woman who doesn't yet know her own strength. After all, Makovsky says, Katniss is a character who's \"just trying to survive.\" So when she created those costumes, she looked to the past for inspiration, creating items for Katniss' home of District Twelve by incorporating themes from the Great Depression. As a result, \"Katniss has practical clothes -- it has to make sense where she got them,\" Makovsky says. \"District 12 is American work wear, and that is what she would wear while she hunted.\" Katniss isn't the only recent movie character to rev up the fashion scene. \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's\" Lisbeth Salander enthralled viewers with her distinctive punk style, and even \"Twilight's\" Bella Swan gained fashion popularity with her simple wedding dress seen in \"Breaking Dawn\" and Northern Pacific coast fashion. \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's\" dark urban look was recreated for consumers by Swedish retailer H&M, which released a limited edition Lisbeth Salander-inspired line, featuring key leather pieces, torn and worn shirts and hoodies, all tied together with an industrial color scheme. One Los Angeles store sold out of the line in 10 minutes after the line went on sale, according to \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's\" costume designer, Trish Summerville, who worked in conjunction with H&M to create the line. Teen Vogue's Keltner de Valle also notes how that theme resonated on the runway during the fall fashion season in 2011. \"For so long, designers were collaborating with mass retailers, [but] a new trend could be costume designers collaborating with mass retailers to create [a] character-inspired wardrobe. It almost seems like a no-brainer.\" And yet, while Summerville created a character-inspired line with Lisbeth Salander, Makovsky said that's currently not her intention. \"I didn't want the fashion to take over, [because] that is not what the movie is about,\" she said. \"The movie is about a girl's journey. That is what a costume designer does, we tell the character's story.\" Whether the clothing ends up being crafted specifically for fans or not, it's always that story told through a character's costume that the consumers cling to. To dress like Katniss, in some regard, is to adopt her trademark characteristics, and the popularity of her clothing points to a characterization that's hit home. \"There was a time when being powerful and being pretty were mutually exclusive, and these strong female archetypes are becoming really popular and girls are really responding to that,\" says Keltner de Valle. InStyle.com entertainment editor Bronwyn Barnes agrees, positing out that the look and feel of characters like Katniss and Lisbeth are so appealing to audiences because these characters are in charge of their own destinies. \"I think these characters struck the right time in pop culture,\" Barnes said. \"People are looking for the modern day heroine.\" And to dress like one, too.",

The game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened-side, ironically and lovingly nicknamed the Blue Brazil by Scottish football fans, had managed to shut-out their hosts and in-form opponents. Then, the goals began to arrive. Minutes 26, 27 and 29 saw Hearts Dutch striker Genero Zeefuik grab a quickfire hat-trick, the third after a penalty and red-card to Cowdenbeath defender Lewis Toshney. A brief lull followed before Hearts scored again in minutes 33 and 39 through Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker respectively. And while half-time provided Cowdenbeath some brief respite, another torrent of goals was to come when play resumed. By the end of the 90 minutes, Hearts had scored five more times to ensure an astonishing 10-0 victory. Morgaro Gomis, Alim Ozturk Danny Wilson and substitute Osman Sow (twice) did the second-half damage. \"I've never been involved in a result like that in my entire career,\" said Hearts head coach, Robbie Neilson after the game. \"I spoke to the players at half time and told them to keep going, try to score more,\" he added. The result matches Cowdenbeath's heaviest ever loss, an 11-1 reverse to Clyde way back in 1951. But that's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior Scottish football. That distinctive honor remains in the possession of wonderfully named Bon Accord who were trounced 36-0 by Arbroath in 1880. It might be little consolation to Cowdenbeath tonight, but at least they were along way off Bon Accord levels of ineptitude.",

        "article": "Forces from Russia and other NATO member states have been linked to more than 40 dangerous incidents over the past eight months, a report has revealed. They include three incidents during the past year which could have sparked open conflict between Russia and the West, according to the findings by the European Leadership Network. The report follows this weekend's celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, during which ex-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the West were in danger of entering a 'new Cold War.' Russia has been involved in more than 40 dangerous incidents over the past eight months; earlier this month the Swedish military hunted a suspected Russian submarine near Stockholm . Mikhail Gorbachev warned that Russia and the West were in danger of entering a 'new Cold War . According to Fox News the report said:\u00a0'We believe [the incidents] are a very serious development, not necessarily because they indicate a desire on the part of Russia to start a war but because they show a dangerous game of brinkmanship is being played, with the potential for unintended escalation in what is now the most serious security crisis in Europe since the cold war.' Gorbachev accused the West, particularly the U.S, of giving in to 'triumphalism' after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the communist bloc. The result, he said, could partly be seen in the inability of global powers to prevent or resolve conflicts in Yugoslavia, the Middle East and most recently Ukraine. The first incident noted in the report involved a near-collision between a civilian airliner and a Russian spy plane that had turned off its transponders - making it difficult to track by air controllers - that occurred in March. The aircraft, on its way to Rome from Copenhagen, was carrying 132 people. The abduction of Eston Kohver, an Estonian secret service operative, who was taken to Moscow in September and accused of espionage, was the second major incident noted in the report. The third involved last month's hunt in Sweden for a suspected Russian submarine, after 'foreign underwater activity' was spotted in Stockholm. The report said Moscow should 'urgently re-evaluate' its posture and also recommended both Russia and NATO improve communications and exercise 'military and political restraint'; above, President Vladimir Putin is seen at an APEC conference in China yesterday . According to the report, most of the incidents have occurred around the Baltic Sea. Others have happened over the Black Sea and along both the U.S. and Canadian borders. In September, military officials said that two F-22 fighter jets intercepted six Russian military airplanes that were flying about 55 nautical miles from the coast of Alaska. After the U.S. jets were scrambled the planes returned to Russia. Two of the planes were later spotted 40 nautical miles off the Canadian coastline in the Beaufort Sea. The report said Moscow should 'urgently re-evaluate' its posture. It also recommended both Russia and NATO improve communications and exercise 'military and political restraint'.",

        "article": "By . Richard Hartley-parkinson and Rob Preece . PUBLISHED: . 03:48 EST, 26 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:03 EST, 28 June 2012 . A family has spoken of their shock after a father-and-son's birthday treat in a \u00a3150,000 hired super-car ended in tragedy as it hurtled off a runway at 100mph ending up on its roof in a garden leaving the driver critically injured. Father-of-four Graham Padmore, 58, is fighting for . his life after he lost control of the Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder at . Woodford aerodrome in Cheshire. His . disabled son Mark, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, was a . passenger in the car but escaped with minor injuries after being pulled . from the wreckage. Accident: Graham Padmore and his disabled son Mark who were in Lamborghini crash. Mr Padmore suffered serious head and chest injuries and fighting for his life in hospital . Mangled: The \u00a3150,000 Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder ended up in a garden after hurtling off a runway at 100mph . Mr Padmore was flung from the car and suffered serious head and chest injuries. In a statement, the Padmore family said the drive was intended as a once-in-a-lifetime treat for Mark, who has cerebral palsy. 'It was the first run at the aerodrome . and Graham was driving in a straight line, not round and round when he . crashed,' they said. 'We have not had any details back yet . about the car. Graham is a sensible family man who is very safety . conscious and would never do anything to put himself or Mark in danger. 'Sadly, this was a birthday treat . which has gone tragically wrong. We would like to thank the staff at the . aerodrome who risked their lives to drag Mark from the car, all the . emergency services and the staff at Wythenshawe Hospital. 'Our main priority now is to concentrate on hoping for our dad\u2019s recovery.' Mr Padmore, who was also celebrating his birthday, had hired the car, which has a top speed of 200mph, as a treat. The pair had been given special permission to use the runway by the owners of the site, Avro Heritage. A Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, like the one Mr Padmore crashed . The . crash happened on Monday at the western end of the airfield, with the . Lamborghini smashing through two fences and a ditch before ending up on . its roof in the garden of a large farmhouse. Graham's wife Georgina and daughters Helen, 28, and Claire, 30, were watching, it is believed. Adam . Jones, 37, a birdwatcher from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, who . witnessed the aftermath, said: 'There were a dozen police cars on the . airfield which, considering it has been closed for a year, I thought was . a bit strange. 'I got out of my car and in the garden was an up-turned Lamborghini with about half-a-dozen police officers standing near it. 'I\u2019m surprised anyone got out of that car because it was so badly mangled and upside down. 'It seemed to have jumped over a ditch and into the back garden. 'To be honest, I assumed it had been a high-speed chase. Now it turns out it wasn\u2019t like that. It was a tragic accident.' Graham is being treated for severe chest and head injuries at Wythenshawe hospital. The Lamborghini left the road towards the western end of the runway, flipping over a ditch and two fences to land in a garden . A . neighbour told the Sun: 'Graham is a sensible driver and didn't want to . break the speed limit on public roads so he tried to organise doing it . as safely as possible. 'He wanted to treat his son. They were driving it all weekend and were having a fantastic time.' Avro Heritage spokesman James Fletcher said their thoughts were with the family of the two men. He said: 'I can confirm that there were no other vehicles involved.' It is understood the pair were allowed to use the runway for free at their own risk. Sergeant . Danny Byrne from Greater Manchester Police's Serious Collision . Investigation Unit, said: 'We believe the vehicle was being driven at a . high speed and it is likely the driver may have lost control. 'Members of the injured man's family are being comforted by specially trained officers at this difficult time.' A . spokesman for the police force said: 'Officers were called to an . airfield on Chester Road, Stockport following reports a hired sports car . had been involved in a collision. 'On . arrival, it was discovered that a Lamborghini was upside down in the . garden of a nearby house. No other vehicles were involved. 'A 58-year old man, the driver, was taken to hospital where his condition is described as critical. A 21-year-old man suffered minor bruising and has been discharged.'",

        "article": "MALMO, Sweden (CNN) -- The breathy vocals of Nina Persson helped launch The Cardigans onto the music scene in the 1990s. The band developed its dreamy pop sound in the Southern Swedish town of Malmo. Singer Nina Persson finds musical inspiration in love and relationships. They were catapulted to international success in 1997, when the single \"Lovefool\" appeared on the soundtrack for \"Romeo and Juliet,\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song's chorus (\"Love me, love me, say that you love me\") became a pop anthem. In addition to fronting The Cardigans, Persson, 34, has worked on solo projects under the name A Camp. Now, after a near decade long hiatus, her second A Camp album, \"Colonia,\" is due out later this month. Persson, who splits her time between New York and Malmo, talks to CNN's \"My City, My Life\" about music, inspiration and life after \"Lovefool.\" CNN: How did The Cardigans start? Nina Persson: We formed the band in this town where we are all originally from -- Jonkoping -- and that was in 1992. Magnus and Peter were the two guys who actually met and wanted to form the band. And then they recruited people and I was one of the first to be recruited, along with a friend of mine who played guitar in the first version of The Cardigans. I had not sung before that really. I was sort of hired because they knew they wanted a girl singing. And I was like 'I'm a girl' and I guess we got along well and I was willing to learn to sing. So that's how it started really.  Watch Nina take CNN on a tour of her favorite Malmo spots \u00bb . CNN: How big was music in your life before you joined the band? Nina Persson: I've loved music my whole life. But I never really listened to a record and thought that was something that I wanted to do. I was interested in becoming a painter, an architect, a designer. Those are the things I was interested in. But music, I never took instrument classes -- it was a random thing to start doing. CNN: Sometime a career finds you? Nina Persson: Yeah and I was a person who was really helped by it. I was looking for something but I didn't know what it was and it proved to fulfill what I needed at the time. CNN: How is A Camp different from The Cardigans? Nina Persson: It's hard to say what makes it different because I'm still doing the same thing -- I'm still writing songs and singing them -- but it feels like it's a bigger freedom because I am in charge in A Camp. I like both. Both serve good purposes. I like to be in the collective, being part of the machinery, but I also really enjoy being dictator. CNN: How do you define yourself as a musician now? Nina Persson: Well I'm not. I'm not one of these people who live and breathe music. In the beginning I was a reluctant musician -- I still haven't bothered to learn an instrument. I'm still only a singer and that's how I write my songs. I'm always superstitious that if I do learn an instrument I would pop the bubble a bit. CNN: Is there anything else you would have liked to have done if you hadn't done singing? Nina Persson: At the time when I was found, picked up by the band, I was into art. I was really good at drawing, really creative. I made stuff, I built stuff, I sewed stuff. I thought I would end up in that world somewhere. Photography was a big thing for me. In retrospect, I'm sure that could have been a good career for me. But recently I've started to wish that I could start over and dedicate my life to medicine. I would have loved to go to med school. I don't think I will because I don't want to spend seven or eight years in training, but I dream about working in a hospital. CNN: What were your inspirations over the years? Nina Persson: That's an incredibly difficult question to answer, but I think I'm a sucker for constantly going back to the subject of love and relationships. It also varies very much from project to project and month to month. I'm very emotional when it comes to the music. I want to make people cry. CNN: Tell us the story of how the band ended up in Malmo.  See photos of Nina in Malmo \u00bb . Nina Persson: We moved here because we started to record in Tambourine Studios which was here. Most studios are in Stockholm so sort of all roads wanted to drag us to Stockholm but we did persist and came here. CNN: When you came to Malmo, what was it like starting out in the early days? Nina Persson: Our parents helped us move down here which was really sweet. They sort of dropped us off and waved goodbye and we moved in. We really did hang out, the five of us, quite exclusively in the beginning. CNN: What was the area like back then? Has it changed? Nina Persson: Well actually the area where I now live hasn't changed that much. A lot of Malmo has moved away from the blue collar past it has, but not that area. It has strangely remained the same, and I like it. CNN: Do you think the gritty atmosphere of Malmo has helped you stay grounded? Nina Persson: Well it's hard to say how much has to do with the people we are or how much to do with Malmo. But there certainly is something here that does not encourage big headedness. CNN: The musical heritage of Malmo is quite rocky. How did you guys fit in? Nina Persson: People thought we were really ridiculous when we came to this totally rock place and played pop music. So we didn't fit in at all -- we were never part of the scene here. CNN: You were happy to be outsiders of the rocky heritage? Nina Persson: I think we felt sort of cool about doing our own thing. We thought we knew something that the others didn't understand. CNN: Is there something about Malmo that helps shape your music or influence you? Nina Persson: I think Malmo did have a big influence on us. Obviously we came here for the sound, and we got the sound we wanted. We were away from the industry -- that was great for us. I really did appreciate being in a place where there is not a lot whole of press and industry. Nina takes . CNN: So you also live in New York. What brings you back to Malmo? Nina Persson: For me, I love Malmo very much because of my friendships. In Malmo I get the intimacy and get to run into my friends in the street once in a while which is a lovely feeling and I get to have a great grocery store just around the corner. CNN: If Malmo was a person, what kind of person would it be? Nina Persson: It would be somebody who has been around for a while and survived a lot of hardships -- somebody you don't mess with, somebody really intelligent, stubborn, with a lot of beauty on the inside.",

        "article": "By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Put away the make-up and cancel the gym membership - now you can see how you'd look with a bit of nip and tuck with little to no effort at all thanks to an app that lets you photoshop your face in real-time. Beauty Mirror for iOS, created by New York-based Modiface, lets users enhance their image using an iPhone or iPad as a virtual mirror. With various features users can alter their facial features to their heart\u2019s content - and then share a video of their new appearance with others. Scroll down for video . New York-based Modiface has unveiled an app that changes your looks. Called Beauty Mirror (shown) it enables to alter your appearance on the go. The app has a number of filters and settings that can change your face. It can, for example, show you what you'd look like if you were thinner or had clearer skin . Through live 3D face tracking the app gives users the ability to apply customisable facial, skin and anti-aging effects to every angle of their face instantly as they look into the camera. The company claims its transformations are \u2018seamless\u2019 and designed to produce an improved image only noticeably edited to the user. \u2018Beauty Mirror is designed to give users a very natural looking modified image through the addition of subtle effects, like skin clearing and slight weight loss,\u2019 said Miriam Pettinen, director of partnerships and mobile strategy at Modiface. \u2018We\u2019re excited to bring an app to the marketplace that will not leave users looking very obviously edited, but instead just slightly more polished.\u2019 While the app is free to download, unlocking all the features will cost \u00a31.49 ($1.99). Instant 3D facial tracking and calibration takes less than a second to find and track your facial features. Photo-realistic 3D effects result then apply changes to your face in real-time with allow you to see a 'new you' as you look from side to side. Four pre-set looks and over 14 customisable effects such as weight loss and skin perfection can then be applied. You can then record, save and share your modified videos with a single touch. Through live simulation the app updates face location and pose every 0.03 seconds as up to 14 customisable effects are applied to the face while the user looks into the camera. Some of the effects include eye enlargement, facelift, skin clearing, acne reduction and weight loss. Users are able to take a picture of themselves at any point or record their transformation as a video, which is then saved directly to their device for sharing on social networks. In the coming months Beauty Mirror technology will also be integrated as filters that users will be able to apply while using video chatting programs. The technology will also be used by several anti-aging and skin-care brands for in-store product simulation. A number of settings (left) to retouch your face are included on the phone including cheek lift, face lift and slimming. On the right, a 'before' picture can be seen in the inset image, while the altered image is shown on the main image with noticeable slimming effects to those that have seen the original .",

        "article": "Meet the Sydney artist having a crack at our politicians. Jenna Bloom has been busy painting the faces of Australia's  leaders for her new satirical exhibition Pollie Cracker. The stencil artist has drawn inspiration from comments and  opinions  by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial. 'Everyone has strong opinions and I started to notice that quite a bit on social media,' Ms Bloom told Daily Mail Australia. Sydney artist Jenna Bloom has been busy painting the faces of Australia's leaders for her new satirical exhibition Pollie Cracker . 'I'm quite a sarcastic person and I thought the exhibition would be a good way to the information people are putting out there into imagery.' And no politician is safe from Ms Bloom's can of spray paint. Among those who have made the satirical cut including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Treaurer Joe Hockey, Clive Palmer, Education Minister Christopher Pyne, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. This cardboard painting of Prime Minister Tony Abbott as a homeless man is one of Ms Bloom's favourites due to its social context . Former NSW Premier is painted on a goon bag after he publicly resigned after lying about a $3,000 bottle of wine he received . 'I mainly focused on them because they're the ones in the media spotlight at the moment. Some of their statements, for whatever reason, have been quite controversial,' Ms Bloom said. Scott Morrison's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the Immigration Minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia via boat. Education Minister Christopher Pyne is featured sitting on a chair in the 'naughty corner' and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop was painted with her head in the sand due to her stance on climate change. Ms Bloom drew inspiration from comments by politicians that have made waves on social media for being controversial, like billionaire Clive Palmer pictured here as a walrus . Scott Morrison's face has been painted onto a welcome mat because of his role as the Immigration Minister in stopping asylum seekers from coming to Australia via boat . Former Prime Ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, who infamously toppled each other from Labor's leadership have been painted on tombstones . 'But the Tony Abbott piece with him as a homeless person is my favourite. I live in Kings Cross and regularly see people begging for money to survive. I always feel an immense amount of empathy for them and I was trying to depict if there was any empathy in politics?' Ms Bloom said she wasn't trying to push an agenda with her artwork, just prompt discussion. 'I just want people to get a laugh out of it and then make up their own minds,' she said. Ms Bloom painted Christopher Pyne sitting on a chair in the 'naughty corner' for his role as the Federal Education Minister . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been painted with 'her head in the sand' for her position on climate change . This artwork by Ms Bloom earned her a finalist spot in the Stencil Art Prize 2014 . US President Barack Obama will make a brief appearance in Ms Bloom's exhibition as the only international politician. Mr Abbott reportedly gifted him a surfboard . 'I really do think people will see the humorous side. You make a joke, but not everyone is going to laugh.' Pollie Cracker will feature at Black Penny\u2019s Blacklisted Gallery, 648 Bourke Street, Surry Hills, from October 28 to November 3.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- A self-help guru who was convicted in the deaths of three participants in an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony deserves a new trial, his attorneys argued Tuesday. James Arthur Ray was found guilty of negligent homicide in the deaths of the participants, but an Arizona jury in June deemed him not guilty of manslaughter charges. Negligent homicide means a defendant should have known better, while manslaughter suggests that the defendant knew and blatantly disregarded this knowledge. Ray's attorneys went before a Superior Court judge in Yavapai County, Arizona, claiming he should be tried again because of prosecutorial misconduct, a court official said. The official, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said the hearing started shortly after 11 a.m. MT and ran until a lunch break. The hearing is scheduled to run for the rest of the day. The defense claims the prosecution did not disclose evidence on time. Ray's sentencing, originally scheduled for July 25, has been pushed back. The case stems from an October 2009 ceremony in Sedona, Arizona. Prosecutors claimed that Ray's recklessness in operating the sweat lodge caused the deaths of Kirby Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York; James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee; and Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota. At least 15 others who took part in the sweat lodge ceremony became ill. More than 40 others were uninjured. Prosecutors argued that the lodge, made of willow trees and branches and covered with tarpaulins and blankets, was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. They also said Ray didn't monitor the temperature inside the lodge or the well-being of participants and was indifferent to those clearly having trouble. Ray's lawyers countered that what happened was a tragic accident, not a crime. They asked witnesses who were in the sweat lodge whether they signed a release form warning them of the dangers. All replied that they signed, but some said they didn't read the form. Ray's attorneys also suggested that exposure to an unknown toxin in the lodge -- perhaps a pesticide, rat poison or something in the type of wood used to heat the rocks -- could have caused the deaths. Event participants paid up to $10,000 to seek \"new areas of consciousness\" at the October 2009 Spiritual Warrior retreat in the desert, according to trial testimony. Many had attended previous James Ray International seminars.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Solid support from registered Democrats and women in New Hampshire were crucial Tuesday as Sen. Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week's Iowa caucuses. Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington. She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary, with 39 percent of the vote to Obama's 37. \"Last week, I listened to you, and in the process I found my own voice,\" the New York senator said after her victory. \"Now let's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me.\" Forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for Obama, and 31 percent said they backed Clinton. Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled. Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called, Obama congratulated Clinton. But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself. \"But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago, is because it's not just about what I will do as president,\" he said. \"It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it. That's what this election is all about.\" But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats. Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents. Clinton also claimed the majority of women's votes, according to the polling. That's in contrast to last week's Iowa caucuses, in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton. Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround. \"If I had a single word, the word would be 'women,' \" said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. \"She got the women back.\" And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top. \"Union voters have her a 10 point lead,\" he said. CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third. College graduates, who made up 29 percent of the electorate, opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama's 37 percent, according to the polling. Those polled who called themselves very liberal, and moderate, went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split. Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire. The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily. \"They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging,\" said CNN analyst Donna Brazille, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's campaign in 2000. \"I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race.\" New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton's campaign. If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front-runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries. \"Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton,\" Schneider said. \"Sixty-seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40, and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama.\" Over the past several days, Clinton has trumpeted her experience, saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator. After losing to Obama in last week's Iowa caucuses, it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process. The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday. She said she had more experience than he, and was therefore more qualified. He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington. And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq, and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq. Then, there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton's almost-tears. Clinton's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter's question about her health and appearance. Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely, too cold. In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters, an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying: \"This is very personal for me, it's not just political, it's [that] I see what's happening, we have to reverse it.\" Her voice broke, and she was then applauded by the crowd. Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters, according to CNN's John King, but turned off some female voters. Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich. E-mail to a friend .",

        "article": "By . Anthony Bond . PUBLISHED: . 06:06 EST, 5 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:35 EST, 5 February 2013 . Locked up: Polish man Michael Minorczyk, who moved to Britain to find work, has become one of the first men in the UK to be jailed for squatting . A Polish man who moved to Britain to find work has been jailed under tough new anti-squatting laws for refusing to move out of an empty house where he had been sleeping. Former soldier Michael Minorczyk, 27, was arrested by police after defying requests to move out of the empty property in Blackburn. The Polish immigrant, who exploited EU border control policies to settle in the UK in 2005 only to end up homeless and an alcoholic, was prosecuted following the scrapping of squatters rights in September last year. At Blackburn Magistrates' Court in Lancashire, Minorczyk pleaded guilty to a new squatting offence and was jailed for 15 weeks. The court heard Minorczyk was arrested on January 31 after police acting on a tip off found him inside the boarded up property in New Wellington Street, Blackburn, which is empty due to renovation. The officers got into the house through a broken door and could see Minorczyk was sleeping on a makeshift bed in a downstairs room. They woke him up and told him he was squatting and had to leave and was told not to return. But 20 minutes later police returned to check on the house and found him back inside the property lying in a drunken stupor sleeping in the same makeshift bed. He was arrested when he refused to leave. In mitigation Ian Huggan, defending, said Minorczyk had come to the UK from Poland in 2005. He got a job and everything was fine until the breakdown of his relationship. He returned to Poland 'to straighten his head' but when he came back to Blackburn found that his former partner had started a new relationship. Prosecuted: Michael Minorczyk defied police requests to move out of an empty house where he had been bedding down at night . 'He had hoped to reconcile the relationship and was unable to cope with the situation he was faced with,' said Mr Huggan. 'He . started to drink and unfortunately the drink has taken over his life. He hasn't caused any difficulties other than being in a property he . shouldn't have been in.' Michael Minorczyk has been jailed following a successful prosecution under new squatting laws. Previously, . police could not evict squatters as soon as they moved into somebody's property. So a homeowner's main option to get them out was through a civil court . order - which could be time consuming and costs many tens of thousands . of pounds. These rules were changed and new legislation introduced in September last year. The new offence protects homeowners . or legitimate tenants who have been excluded from their homes. It will . also protect those who own residential buildings that they don't live . in, such as landlords, local authorities or second home owners. But . homeless charity Crisis said the new law would criminalise vulnerable . people, leaving them in prison or facing a fine they cannot pay. Last . August Minorczyk gave an interview to a local newspaper investigating . street drinking in the town - with many of the culprits being men and . women, from Eastern Europe. He . said: 'I came to England with my girlfriend in 2005 but shortly after . we broke up. I started work but with the spiralling economy, I ended up . losing my job and finding myself sleeping on my friend's sofa and . drinking hard, which he didn't like. 'I returned home to Poland for a short time before eventually returning to Blackburn where I found myself living on the streets. 'I now sleep in the abandoned cars in King Street. I am an alcoholic and I need alcohol to survive. I have recently started suffering severe fits and if I don't drink they get worse. I am scared I am going to die. 'I often drink up to six litres of Frosty Jacks cider in a day. I am going into rehab. I don't want to be like this anymore. 'I get in trouble with the police for stealing so I can pay for drink. I have been doing this for seven years and that is too long.' Last September a 21-year-old squatter Alex Haigh, from Plymouth was arrested at a flat in Pimlico, central London and was jailed for 12 weeks under the anti squatting legislation.",

        "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- First came the iPhone. Then, there was the \"iFart\" flatulence noise download. Now, there's \"Pull My Finger\" -- and next could come the lawsuits. A Florida-based company has accused a Colorado competitor in federal court of trademark infringement and unfair business practices over the phrase \"Pull My Finger.\" The dispute began after the makers of iFart began using phrase \"pull my finger\" in advertisements for their products. Air-o-Matic, based in Jacksonville, Florida, and Colorado-based InfoMedia, Inc., both offer a range of competing software applications, or \"apps,\" that subscribers can download into their multitasking cell phones. Users can make calls, listen to music, browse the Internet and play games on the devices. Individual \"apps\" cost a dollar and up, and can be used to get directions, read restaurant reviews and make funny noises. Enter the flatulence sound app, which both companies offer to customers. Air-o-Matic says its app, \"Pull My Finger\" has a unique brand identity that its competitor has infringed. It wants $50,000 from Infomedia to settle the dispute and may sue in federal court. In a formal complaint filed in a Denver, Colorado, federal court, however, InfoMedia says the phrase is a common \"descriptive\" term used in its advertising and cannot be trademarked. The company wants a judge to step in now, before any lawsuit is filed, and allow it to continue to use the phrase. According to InfoMedia's legal filing, its iFart app \"boasts a number of unique features including a built-in security system designed to aurally surprise and discourage iPhone theft. iFart also features a \"Sneak Attack\" function using a timer that emits the sound of flatulence when it goes off, the company says, and can also be used as a prank to an unsuspecting person. Joel Conn, founder of Infomedia, said on his own blog that his app is a \"cultural phenomenon.\" The company claims there are about 75 different flatulence simulation software applications. There was no word on when a judge might rule on the complaint.",

Furious: Dave Jode, 29, a restaurant manager for Burger King has been taken to court and fined - for dropping a cigarette butt down a drain. This is a file picture of a Burger King . Mr Jode refused to pay a \u00a350 fixed penalty notice and the case eventually ended up in Truro Magistrates Court where he was fined \u00a3100 for littering. Mr Jode was also ordered to pay \u00a3100 towards the council\u2019s legal bill - which ran to a total of \u00a3666. Speaking afterwards Mr Jode, of Threemilestone, Cornwall, said he will not pay his fine because the prosecution was 'ridiculous'. He said: 'How are you supposed to know that putting a butt down a drain isillegal? 'It is a ridiculous penalty for someone who picks rubbish up all the time. Isweep the streets here myself.' Brian Keast, one of the council officials from the public health and protection department, who witnessed the littering, said: . 'Mr Jode was arrogant. It took a police officer and PCSO to deal with thesituation. 'Littering is a crime, albeit low level, but it is a serious problem.' Burger King said it was looking into the incident on October 26 last year.",

        "article": "Washington is all about the fiscal cliff these days. In Doha, Qatar, world leaders are negotiating over climate change. Federal debt and carbon emissions are indeed two big problems on the nation's front burner. But they are just the beginning. As the fog of the election season lifts, America has a lot to worry about -- everything from competing economically with China to housing rapidly retiring baby boomers. But there is another way to look at it. Decisively addressing the nation's primary global challenges -- backed by the market potential of powerful demographic shifts at home and abroad -- could yield opportunity unlike any other in America's history. First, our four major challenges: . \u2022 In the last 20 years, households, businesses and the federal government accumulated exceptional levels of debt, which they are now trying, painfully, to pay down. The 2008 financial crisis triggered a spiral of unemployment and reduced demand that is nowhere near complete. As household income contracts, families consume less and try to erase debt, reducing demand for goods and services, forcing companies to reduce expenses, meaning more layoffs, deepening unemployment, and so on. Monetary policy and fiscal stimulus may have contained the worst of the pain, but they cannot cure the disease. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is right when he says the economy needs a broad-based and durable source of demand. \u2022 Over the last 20 years, roughly 1 billion people entered the global middle class. In the next 20 years, there will be 3 billion more. Good news? Yes, except that these new consumers use huge amounts of resources and emit more carbon, a roughly 300% increase. Expect price increases for basic commodities like energy, food, and minerals, and deepening conflicts among the great powers over resources in familiar places: the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, and Central Asia. \u2022 Climate change is already with us. Superstorm Sandy, the Derecho, Arctic melting, and droughts in the Midwest, India, China, and Russia this past year confirm the scientifically proven trend. Beyond this, humanity consumes about 150% of the \"goods\" provided by the earth's natural systems -- including fresh water, soils, and fisheries. We are consuming our limited endowment of natural capital, reducing future returns while our global population expands to 9 billion. This is massively destabilizing, whether you're in New York City or Pakistan. \u2022 Our infrastructure, systems, and supply chains are not designed for the scale or the risks of the 21st century. Transportation, financial, food, and industrial systems have choke points, are inefficient, and lack oversight and sufficient investment. They are magnifying threat and risk when they should be compartmentalizing them. Quiet disruptions in such things as rare-earth minerals (critical to high-tech manufacturing), auto parts,  and computer hard drives have all hit industry in the last two years, for example. Opinion: We're living the dream, we just don't realize it . America's economy must do some heavy lifting. Just as the country transitioned from war production to civilian production 60 years ago, it must now transition to sustainable production, while building a new American dream. If it can, the United States will be ideally positioned to rebuild our middle class, compete globally and pre-empt growing confrontation over resources. We must adapt and once again define the future. First, America has a homegrown demographic opportunity unlike any other. Driven by baby boomers and millennials, 56% percent of homebuyers say that they want the trappings of their American dream to be walkable and convenient, not car-dependent and isolated, and home prices already reflect this.  From 2014 to 2029, these two largest American demographics, each 25% of the total population, will meet in the housing market as boomers empty their nests and as more millennials marry and have children -- creating the largest concentration of demand for housing since the period after World War II.  To seize this opportunity, however, Washington needs to let cities and towns decide how to grow,  and discourage the car-based population dispersal known as sprawl. Not only will this put Americans back to work in construction, it could reduce the environmental footprint by roughly a third. Second, global demand for food and resources is skyrocketing. By 2050 global food production must increase by 60%, while soil and fresh water must be regenerated, not depleted. American farmers are held back by expensive, distorting, and antiquated Cold War era subsidies that essentially pay farmers to overwork the land and waste scarce water resources. We've already lost up to 50% of Iowa's topsoil, drained the Ogallala Aquifer, and created a fertilizer-based \"death bloom\" at the mouth of the Mississippi. While conventional agribusiness is enjoying high global prices, climate-related drought and floods have reduced the harvest to the lowest since the early 1970s. Shifting the worst of these subsidies from big commodity crops (like corn, wheat, and soybeans) to pay farmers to convert their operations to modern regenerative systems will help our farming families earn a more secure living and be better stewards of the land. Finally, the world needs innovation. To accommodate 3 billion new middle-class aspirants in 20 years, we will need to make our resources more productive while reducing the amount of carbon emitted. By focusing on advanced materials, energy and manufacturing, we can rebuild our middle class, supplying the jobs, wages, and returns Americans deserve. To lead this revolution in resource productivity, we must stop taxing work and start taxing waste. Washington universalized the income tax to pay for World War II, when we had full employment and needed to subsidize resource extraction to get materiel to the Allies. Now we get 80% of federal revenues from taxing individuals, are suffering from long-term unemployment, and consume far more resources than Europe for an inferior standard of living. We're conserving labor and expending resources when we need to do the opposite. We have the demand. Do we have the capital? Plenty. There are trillions of dollars in pent-up investment capital looking for reasonable, reliable returns, as the chairman of Goldman Sachs recently wrote. Instead of Washington footing the bill, the federal government must reorient the Cold War subsidies for housing, agriculture, and resource waste and create a new generation of regional financing mechanisms. These new regional tools must connect Wall Street's capital to the infrastructure and innovation opportunities that will arise as regions plan for and build the future. If it's done right, we'll channel excess liquidity back into the productive economy and stop it from sloshing around as underperforming corporate cash, money market funds, and high-risk derivatives. Yes, Washington must address the issue of the fiscal cliff and make progress on climate change. But isolated solutions will only waste precious time. Tapping into the new demand pools of the 21st century, unleashing pent-up capital, and shifting American markets to lead a revolution in resource productivity will position the United States to lead the world once again.

Greece\u2019s Culture Ministry said that most of the earth around the mythical creatures has now been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes. Chief archaeologist Katerina Peristeri, believes that the monument being uncovered is a unique tomb, not just for Greece but for the entire Balkanic peninsula, and described it as being of \u2018global interest\u2019.

Alexander III of Macedon was born in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia in July 356 BC. He died of a fever in Babylon in June 323 BC. Alexander led an army across the Persian territories of Asia Minor, Syria and Egypt claiming the land as he went. His greatest victory was at the Battle of Gaugamela, now northern Iraq, in 331 BC, and during his trek across these Persian territories, he was said to never have suffered a defeat. This led him to be known as Alexander the Great. Following this battle in Gaugamela, Alexander led his army a further 11,000 miles (17,700km), founded over 70 cities and created an empire that stretched across three continents. This covered from Greece in the west, to Egypt in the south, Danube in the north, and Indian Punjab to the East. Alexander was buried in Egypt. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, far to the west. The lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. His fellow royals were traditionally interred in a cemetery near Vergina, to the west, where the lavishly-furnished tomb of Alexander's father, Philip II, was discovered during the 1970s. But archaeologists believe the Amphipolis grave, which is surrounded by a surprisingly long and well-built wall with courses of marble decorations, may have belonged to a senior ancient official. Dr Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site. Geophysical teams have identified there are three main rooms within the huge circular structure, news.com.au reported. In the past, the lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, one of Alexander's military commanders who became governor of Syria after the king's death. Greece's culture ministry said that earth around the sphinx statues has been removed to reveal part of a marble lintel with frescoes (pictured) but hopes of finding further treasures now seem to be slim . The tomb is situated in Amphipolis region of Serres in Greece (marked). Archaeologists believe the grave may have belonged to a senior ancient official. While it looks largely undisturbed, there are fears that looting took place hundreds of years ago . In Greek tradition, the mythical sphinx has the haunches of a lion, sometimes with the wings of a great bird, and the face of a human - usually a woman. It was described by writers as being treacherous and merciless. In many myths, including Oedipus, those who could not answer a riddle posed by the monster, would be killed and eaten. The sphinx described by the Ancient Egyptians was usually male and more benevolent. In both cultures, they often guarded entrances to temples and important tombs. The oldest sphinx found guarding a site was discovered in Turkey and dates to 9,500 BC. \u2018The excavation will answer the crucial question of who was buried inside,\u2019 Mr Samaras said. Last week The Culture Ministry called for \u2018understanding\u2019 while the Amphipolis excavation proceeds. The discovery has sparked global interest and wild speculation that it may contain rich treasures or the bones of an ancient celebrity. The doorway of the tomb is covered in earth, with traces of painted plaster decoration. \u2018It's astonishing, the biggest tomb we have found in Greece so far,\u2019 said archaeologist Chryssoula Paliadelli, an expert on the period who is not involved in the excavation. \u2018It clearly shows the wealth that allowed construction of what was, at the time, a hugely costly monument.\u2019 While the tomb appears to be undisturbed, there are fears that it could have been looted hundreds of years ago. Part of a stone wall that blocked off the subterranean entrance is missing, while the sphinxes, which were originally six feet (2metres) high, lack heads and wings. Near the sphinxes, excavators have found fragments of a large marble lion that originally capped the mound, which they say indicates the site was severely damaged and dug up in later antiquity. The excavation is expected to last at least another few weeks. Excavator Katerina Peristeri has argued the mound was originally topped by a large stone lion that was unearthed a century ago, and is now situated around 3 miles (5km) from the excavation site (pictured). The lion has been associated with Laomedon of Mytilene, who was one of Alexander's military commanders .",

The father and step mother of Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old whose gun rampage at the Sandy Hook Elementary School killed 26 people, have been pictured for the first time as it is revealed the couple fled their home on the evening of the attack and have not been seen since. Neighbours of Peter Lanza and Shelley Cudiner told MailOnline that the pair packed up their car and left their affluent home in the Stamford suburb of Westover, Connecticut, shortly after being informed of Adam's involvement in the massacre on Friday afternoon. It was also claimed that when Peter, who works in financial services, was told of the tragic Sandy Hook gun massacre that his son had committed he became visibly shaken and made frantic phone calls to try and find out what exactly had happened. Pictured: Peter Lanza, (centre left), and his new wife, Shelley Cudiner, (centre right) have collected the body of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza . 'Peter was informed by a news . reporter who was waiting outside his house that his son was involved in . the shooting,' said a neighbour who has known Shelley for over a decade. 'After news crews descended on their house they calmly packed their bags and drove off and we've not seen them since.' Nice but quiet: Neighbours described Shelley Cudiner, pictured, as a 'very quiet lady' who along with Peter, kept to herself . The news reporter who told Lanza that . his son had potentially committed one of the worst mass shootings in . American history described the moment he learned the scale of the . tragedy in the Stamford Advocate. 'His expression twisted from patient, to surprise to horror,' wrote Maggie Gordon. 'It was obvious that this moment, . shortly after 1.30 p.m. Friday, was the first time he had considered his . family could be involved. 'He quickly declined to comment, rolled up the window, parked in the right side of the two-car garage and closed the door.' The stunned father is then said to . have sat at a table in the front of his three-bedroomed house with a . phone to his ear and his palm to his right cheek. Once Shelley returned home the couple . left and as revealed by the MailOnline have not been seen since by any . of their neighbours. One neighbour who declined to give . their name said that Shelley and Peter Lanza had lived together for . around three years and that she was 'a very nice woman.' The neighbour described Shelley as a 'creature of habit' who never seemed 'out of the ordinary.' Peter Lanza is a vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial . Services and divorced Nancy Lanza in 2009 due to 'irreconcilable . differences.' According to CNN, money troubles contributed to the Lanza's marriage falling apart, around four years ago. The Lanzas filed for divorce on . November 24, 2008, and the divorce was finalised in September 2009 . after an uncontested hearing. Connecticut court . records show Nancy Lanza ticked 'yes' for financial disputes but 'no' for . parenting disputes as reasons for the split. Home: Peter Lanza, the father of Adam Lanza, lives in Stamford, Connecticut, pictured, but hasn't been home since Friday . According to the Stamford Advocate . the couple had arranged a joint custody agreement for Adam, who was 17 . at the time of their divorce. As part of this parental agreement, . Adam was to live primarily with his mother and Peter was allowed . 'liberal visitation and vacations.' Nancy Lanza was shot dead by her son . Adam at the home they shared in Sandy Hook before he traveled to the . elementary school where he killed 20 children and six staff members. While neighbours on the small, quiet . suburban street said that they too were shocked at the involvement of . one of their neighbours in the tragedy, they claimed to know little to . nothing about them. 'I wouldn't have thought the police would be here for that house. Not that house,' said one neighbour. Responding . to reports that Shelley had previously been married, the neighbour said they didn't know. Murderer: Adam Lanza shot dead his mother . and then went on a gun rampage at Sandy Hook elementary school in . Connecticut leaving 26 dead . Shelley is understood to have been married to David Cudiner, 55, of Fairfield, Connecticut. Peter Lanza grew up in Kingston in Rockingham County, New Hampshire. His late father, Adam Lanza's . grandfather, Peter S. Lanza, was an investment broker and insurance . salesman and Peter Jr followed him into a career in finance. According to his resume on LinkedIn, Peter Lanza is tax director and vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services in the New York City area. Father: Peter Lanza, a wealthy executive for General Electric, who is believed to earn $1million a year, moved out of the family home in 2006 . He . has been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern University in Boston . since 1995 and also teaches a partnership tax class in the master's in . taxation degree program at Fairfield University in Fairfield, . Connecticut, according to CNN. On . LinkedIn, Peter wrote of his experience: 'Career dedicated to . developing and refining partnership tax planning and transactional . skills' and 'Work closely with many of the preeminent partnership tax . advisers in the United States on a daily basis.' Shelley Cudiner is a reference librarian and business liaison at the University of Connecticut's Jeremy Richard Library. On the college's website, she wrote: . 'I serve all our undergraduate students and graduate students, with an . emphasis on the business, biology, economics, and psychology . departments, order materials for our degree programs, and coordinate . bibliographic instruction.' Despite going to ground over the . weekend, Peter Lanza took the time to release a statement earlier on Saturday regarding his . son's involvement in the shocking tragedy. 'We too are asking why,' he said in a statement. 'Like so many of you, we are saddened, but struggling to make sense of what has transpired. 'Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy.' He said that all living members of the . Lanza family, including himself and Adam's older brother Ryan, have . been fully cooperating with police and plan to help in any way that they . can as the repercussions of the shooting are felt. 'No words can truly express how heartbroken we are,' he said in the statement. Adam's first victim was his own mother, Nancy, whose dead body police eventually found at the Newtown home that she shared with Adam. It took several hours to confirm that she was the victim, however, since she had been shot in the face and was hard to identify. Nancy Lanza's home in Newtown, Connecticut, where she was found shot dead from a gunshot wound to the face . Mother: Out of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, came a disturbing picture of Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza and his first victim, his mother Nancy, pictured . Peter Lanza divorced Nancy in 2009 . citing 'irreconcilable differences.' Friends and neighbors said the divorce, as far as they knew, was amicable. Jim Leff, a musician who knew Nancy through a local bar and music spot that she frequented, called her a 'lovely person.' But he said he never became close friends with her because she was 'high-strung.' 'What held me back was my impression that she was a little high-strung,' Leff wrote on his blog. 'But . now that I've been filled in by friends about how difficult her . troubled son (the shooter) was making things for her, I understand that . it wasn't that Nancy was overwrought about the trivialities of everyday . life, but that she was handling a very difficult situation with uncommon . grace.' Ryan, Adam's 24-year-old brother was immediately embroiled in the shooting as Adam reportedly had Ryan's ID on him when police found his body in the Sandy Hook elementary school. Questioning: Ryan Lanza is led away for questioning by police after his brother is named as the killer . In fact, he was at work in the . Manhattan office of Ernst & Young when television news reports . started connecting his name to the shooting in Connecticut, and that was . when he started to understand that his brother may have been involved. Lanza . quickly told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times . Square office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on . condition of anonymity. Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene. Lanza, 24, seemed unaware that his younger brother, Adam Lanza, had gunned down 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown before taking his own life. 'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME.' Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking what was going on and if he was alright. According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead. Oh my God.'",

        "article": "By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 07:18 EST, 30 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:25 EST, 30 July 2012 . An angry father flew into a rage and smashed up a shop that supplied legal 'bath salts' type drugs that put his son in hospital. Justin Avery, 24, was taken to New York's Samaritan Hospital after snorting a powder labelled 'glass cleaner' that his friends had called 'fake cocaine'. According to police reports, his father Dan then called the store where his son had paid $20 for the legal high and left a message saying: 'You sold my kid bath salts and I\u2019ll [expletive] kill you'. Dangerous trade: 'Bath salts' and 'glass cleaner' are synthetic highs named after the innocuous products because they can be legally sold if they are marked as not for human consumption . Justin had never used any drug stronger than marijuana, he said, but snorted the glass cleaner for the first time one evening because he was upset and had heard . it would give him a buzz. But by 1.30am his heart was racing wildly, he was sweating heavily and his breathing had become so laboured he thought he would die. Three days earlier, a friend of the 24-year-old\u2019s . had apparently called Avery Sr hallucinating, afraid that people were trying to kill . him. Justin said the friend had also used the so-called 'glass cleaner' bought at Tebb\u2019s Headshop, according to syracuse.com. Avery drove to Tebb\u2019s, based in a little strip . mall, carrying a miniature wooden baseball bat in his truck, as usual. The slight 5'7\", 120-pound man then chased off waiting customers, screaming, 'You need some bath salts?' Shop worker Trevor Harding arrived and opened up, while Mr Avery went to his 2003 Ford Explorer and slid the bat into his trousers. He then went into Tebb\u2019s and pretended to be one of the customers he had just chased away. Bath salts are likely to be stimulant drugs such MPDV or ephedrine. The phrase does not refer to a single chemical, but instead to a range of synthetic drugs that can be sold legally in the US as long as they are not marked for human consumption \u2013 hence the misleading name. In high doses, such drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behaviour, and terrifying hallucinations. Here are just a few of the recent crimes said to have been triggered by the dangerous drugs: . He asked for bath salts or glass . cleaner, he recalled, and Harding put a round blue-and-orange . package on the glass countertop. He claims Harding then pulled out a magazine and opened it to a page that showed him how much glass cleaner to take. 'That\u2019s . when I just went crazy,' said Avery. He pulled the bat out of his . pants and started swinging. He smashed the five-foot-long glass . counter and a couple of glass ashtrays. Then he started flinging . glass pipes from shelves at\u00a0 Harding. 'Here\u2019s a nice one,' Avery remembers yelling as he threw the pipes. 'Here\u2019s another nice one.' He . chased Harding back and forth behind the counter and the pair grappled before Avery returned his bat to the car and gave Harding a lecture. He said he told Harding: 'You\u2019re a sick man to sell this to these kids, knowing it\u2019s gonna twist their minds. You\u2019re pathetic.' Then he asked Harding for the store phone and called the police to tell them what he had done. After 10 to 15 minutes, police arrived and took him into custody. They charged him with two felonies \u2013 criminal mischief and criminal possession of a weapon \u2013 which carry a maximum prison sentence of seven years. The police report says Avery threatened to kill Harding in the store. but Avery said he only intended to scare the clerk. 'I wanted them to know why I did it,' he said. 'The cop asked me and I said, \"So people will know. So other parents who don\u2019t even know their kids can buy this type of drug will be aware.\" 'It sparked in my mind: It\u2019s all over. I\u2019ve lived my life for 30 years to do good, and tried to raise my kids to do good. But I couldn\u2019t help it.' He said he had thought about letting authorities handle it, but the law does not consider those products illegal. The day after Avery\u2019s violence, federal agents and local police raided Tebb\u2019s and other head shops across the country. Agents seized the Watertown store\u2019s supply of glass cleaner, among other products, Mr Harding said in an interview. He said said the store did not sell bath salts because they\u2019re illegal, and claimed the shop was being wrongly accused of peddling harmful drugs. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent filed an affidavit last week in Syracuse federal court to get a search warrant for the store raids. In it, he listed glass cleaners as one of the names drug sellers use to disguise 'highly dangerous chemicals that are ingested by recreational drug users' as a substitute for marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and methamphetamine. The raids follow months of horrific crimes by people disoriented by synthetic drugs. Another frustrated parent, a mother in Batavia, was charged with trespassing two weeks ago after she tried to buy bath salts at a head shop there, then started yelling at employees. Neither police nor prosecutors would comment on their plans for Avery. 'We don\u2019t want people acting as vigilantes,' said police Sgt. Joe Donoghue. Jefferson County District Attorney Cindy Intschert said prosecutors would consider many factors when evaluating the case, as they do in all others. In his blog, Watertown Mayor Jeff Graham asked, 'What juror votes to convict the guy for busting up a head shop that was selling bath salts to his 24-year-old son?' Avery, who earns $2,400 a month setting up double-wide and modular homes, said he was worried about having enough money to hire a lawyer. 'I was being a father,' he added.",

        "article": "Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- At least three Thai soldiers were killed Friday in a new round of clashes with Cambodian troops in a disputed border region, a military official said. Thirteen other Thai troops were injured, Lt. Col. Siriya Khuangsirikul said. The fighting broke out near two temples in the Phanom Dong Rak of southeastern Thailand's Surin province, Thai army spokesman Col. Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said. A Cambodian foreign ministry spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment. Authorities evacuated between 7,000 and 10,000 residents to temporary shelters as clashes erupted, Ong-art Klarmpaibul of the Thai prime minister's office said in an interview with the Thai Public Broadcasting System. Sunsern said the cause of Friday's clashes \"is not yet known.\" At least 10 people were killed when renewed fighting flared up in another disputed border area between the two nations in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement calling on both sides to implement a permanent cease-fire and \"resolve the situation peacefully and through effective dialogue.\" Those clashes, which lasted four days, stemmed from a longstanding conflict related to the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Both Cambodia and Thailand lay claim to the temple, which sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side. At the time, each nation accused the other of firing first, according to a statement from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Conflict over the site has taken place periodically for years. In 1962, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that the site was in Cambodia, adding that the structure was \"an outstanding masterpiece of Khmer architecture.\" But Thailand says the 1.8-square-mile (4.7-square-kilometer) area around Preah Vihear was never fully demarcated, and blames a map drawn at the beginning of the 20th-century during the French occupation of Cambodia. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.",

Members of the Slovenian military winched the baby into a helicopter as floodwater ravaged the northern Bosnian town of \u0160amac on Saturday. The rescue was part of a wider mission to deliver food and equipment to people affected by floods in the region. The Slovenian armed forces helped 52 people to evacuate the severely flooded area during the mission. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Rescued: A three-month-old baby is winched into a helicopter by a member of the Slovenian military as floodwater ravages the Bosnian town of Samac . Bosnia's government says more than one . million people have been affected by the flooding and landslides after . days of the heaviest rainfall recorded in the Balkans since records . began 120 years ago. The . video emerged as authorities warned of a new threat of disease from the . corpses of thousands of tonnes of livestock which drowned in the floods. With the rainfall stopping and temperatures rising, the withdrawing floodwaters revealed a harrowing sight: thousands of dead cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and other animals that were left behind after their panicked owners fled rapidly advancing torrents. 'There are tons of dead animals that we must dispose of,' Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic told a government meeting Tuesday. The rescue was part of a wider mission by the Slovenian military to deliver food and equipment to people affected by floods in the region . The Slovenian armed forces helped 52 people to evacuate the severely flooded area during the mission . One farm near the northern Bosnian town of Samac reported losing 450 of its 500 cows. Authorities are also warning that many . of the more than 100,000 remaining landmines dotted across Bosnia have . been dislodged by heavy rain, flood waters and hundreds of landslides, . shifting beyond their markers. Mine . removal experts estimate that more than 120,000 landmines remain . planted across Bosnia, the legacy of a war that killed 100,000 people . and displaced more than a million. Bosnia's . Mine Action Centre (MAC) has appealed for international help in getting . more equipment and satellite screening to track the movement of mines . after the heaviest rainfall in the Balkans since records began 120 years . ago. New threat of disease: A Bosnian farmer prepares to take away dead cows from a farm near the town of Bosanski Samac along the river Sava, 200kms north of the capital Sarajevo . The withdrawing floodwaters have revealed a harrowing sight of thousands of dead cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and other animals left behind after their panicked owners fled rapidly advancing torrents . The record flooding in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia in past week has forced half a million people out of their homes and led to at least 40 deaths: 20 in Serbia, 18 in Bosnia and two in Croatia. Authorities say the death toll still could go higher. Bosnia declared Tuesday a day of mourning while Serbia said it would hold three days of mourning for flood victims from Wednesday to Friday. Witnesses say the waters in some areas rose within hours, racing into yards and homes without warning and flooding entire towns. In many cases, farmers did not have time to unleash their livestock or let them out of barns to try to swim to safety. Only some were pulled out in time. A Bosnian holds dead livestock near the town of Samac which has reported losing 450 of its 500 cows . Distressing sight: A dead pig lies at the side of the road near the Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac . Authorities in Bosnia have asked for . international help to deal with the animal carcass problem, while . governments in both Serbia and Bosnia have set up special phone lines . for people to reach sanitary teams to pick up dead animals. Serbian . state television on Tuesday showed army teams spreading out to . decontaminate and disinfect flooded areas to prevent possible diseases. Residents . also have been given special sanitary instructions: they are not to . return to their homes before disinfection and not to eat any food from . flooded gardens, orchards or barns. 'Dead . animals are a special problem. Those have to be removed and destroyed . properly or at least dug deep into the ground and covered with calcium . oxide,' said Bosnia's chief epidemiologist, Dr Zeljko Ler. Some of the lucky ones: A man rescues his pigs from floodwater in the Bosnian city of Orasje . Finding dry land: A boy is helped to safety after being evacuated by boat with his family from his home in the city of Orasje, 250 km from the capital of Bosnia, Sarajevo . Several swollen livestock could be . seen along the roads leading toward Serbia's hard-hit town of Obrenovac, . outside the capital of Belgrade. The animal carcasses were apparently brought over from fields and barns for veterinary teams to pick up. In . Obrenovac itself, dozens of stray dogs and others abandoned by fleeing . owners were roaming the town's muddy streets, looking for food among the . scattered debris. Ler . warned that acute stomach ailments and other diseases - including . hepatitis and typhoid - often occur in the aftermath of the flooding. An aerial view of floodwater in Obrenovac, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Belgrade in Serbia . Disaster zone: The record flooding in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia in past week has forced half a million people out of their homes and led to at least 40 deaths: 20 in Serbia (above), 18 in Bosnia and two in Croatia . 'We are warning the population to drink only boiled or bottled water,' he said. 'There are still no mass infections (yet) but for some diseases the incubation period is 14 to 21 days.' In neighboring Croatia, authorities said they managed to save 7,500 livestock from eastern flooded areas and transport them to safety. The floods are still threatening Serbia's biggest power plant, located in Obrenovac, while in Bosnia, many areas faced new land mine dangers after hundreds of landslides hit, shifting mine fields left over from the country's war. Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic (right) wears a shirt reading 'Support Floods, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia' during a charity football match between Formula One drivers and a team of former and current sports stars at the Louis ll stadium in Monaco tonight . Water levels in the mighty Danube were also rising Tuesday and Serbian authorities ordered the evacuation of two villages along the banks of Europe's second-largest river. Both Serbia and Bosnia have appealed for international help, saying damage from the flooding will be measured in billions. The two countries still have not fully recovered from wars of 1990s, which claimed 100,000 lives and left millions homeless.",

        "article": "A four-year-old Israeli boy has been killed by rocket fire from Gaza today - the fourth Israeli civilian to be killed in the latest round of the conflict. The boy died just before sundown in the village of Nahal Oz near the Gaza border after the rocket struck a kibbutz - or communal farm - where he lived. Charred vehicles were seen where the shell landed. The latest death in the conflict prompted harsh words from Israeli prime minister Bejamin Netanyahu, who vowed that Hamas would pay a 'heavy price' for the attack. Scroll down for video . Mortar strike: The boy was killed by a shell fired from Gaza into a Kibbutz (communal farm) not far from the border . Emergency: The boy is the fourth Israeli civilian to die in the conflict . Blasts: Explosions were seen in Gaza today as Israeli shelling continued in the wake of the boy's death . Blasts: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore Hamas would pay a 'heavy price' for the latest Israeli death . It came as violence in Gaza itself intensified, with Hamas killing 18 people whom it described as Israeli spies. Six of the alleged informants were lined up behind a mosque and shot dead after midday prayers. The . Hamas-run website Al Rai suggested the killings were in retaliation for the deaths of three high-ranking military leaders killed in an Israeli air strike yesterday. It portrayed the killings as the . beginning of a new crackdown, under the rallying cry of 'choking the . necks of the collaborators.' The executions came as Israeli rescue officials said a four-year-old boy was killed in a mortar attack near the border with the Gaza Strip. Six of the alleged spies were grabbed from among hundreds of worshippers leaving the city's largest mosque, by men in the uniform of Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades. One of the masked men shouted: 'This is the final moment of the Zionist enemy collaborators' then the gunmen sprayed them with bullets. Rounded up: Hamas fighters grab Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel before executing them in apparent revenge for the deaths of three of leaders . On death row: The victims, their heads covered and hands tied, were shot dead by masked gunmen in front of a crowd of worshippers outside a mosque after prayers . Accused: Another 11 people suspected of collaborating with Israel were killed by gunmen at an abandoned police station in Gaza, Hamas security officials said . Revenge: Hamas media portrayed the killings as the beginning of a new crackdown, under the rallying cry of 'choking the necks of the collaborators' Earlier, another witness saw 11 people . shot dead in a square near the remains of Gaza police headquarters, . which had been bombed by Israeli warplanes. An 18th person was shot in front of bystanders in a separate incident nearby. Two . of those killed were women, according to the Palestinian Center for . Human Rights, which called for an immediate halt to what it said were . 'extra-judicial executions.' A Gaza security official said the suspected informants were killed after they had previously been sentenced by Gaza courts. Al Rai, however, said they were killed after the completion of 'legal procedures', suggesting a hastily arranged hearing. Death sentence: Another witness saw 11 people shot dead in a square near the remains of Gaza police headquarters, which had been bombed by Israeli warplanes . Public executions: Palestinians watch as Hamas militants shoot dead Gazans suspected of collaborating with Israel after rounding them up in broad daylight . Suspects: Palestinian medics carry the body of an alleged collaborator with Israel as another corpse lies in the ambulance after they were executed in Gaza City . The . killings marked the third time since the outbreak of the Gaza war six . weeks ago that Hamas has announced the killing of alleged collaborators. On Thursday, it said seven people had been arrested and that three of them had been killed on suspicion of working with Israel. In pinpointing the whereabouts of the Hamas commanders, Israel likely relied to some extent on local informers. Israel . has maintained a network of informers despite its withdrawal from Gaza . in 2005, at times using blackmail or the lure of exit permits to win . co-operation. Intensification: The boy was the fourth Israeli to die - pictured are Jewish children watching rescue efforts after a Synagogue in Israel was struck by a rocket . Resentment: A Palestinian protester launches a stone from a slingshot in a clash with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank . Bleak: Renewed rocket exchanges have dashed hopes for a lasting truce after a month-long war that has already killed over 2,000 people . Ruined: Palestinians walk under the minaret of the destroyed Al-Sousi mosque in the west of Gaza City after Israel continued with a barrage of air strikes . Tensions high: Israeli soldiers fix the tracks of their tank at an undisclosed location along the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip . Gearing up: Israel soldiers carry their bags as they arrive at an undisclosed location along the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip . Meanwhile, a rocket fired from Gaza hit a synagogue in the Israeli city of Ashdod on Friday, wounding three people, police said. 'There is damage at the scene and a number of people were injured by shrapnel,' police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The attack came shortly before evening prayers ahead of the Jewish Sabbath. Ashdod is around 30 km (20 miles) from Gaza. Earlier, an Israeli airstrike on a Gaza farm killed two Palestinians today, a Gaza health official said, as fighting continued for a third day after the collapse of Egyptian-led cease-fire talks. The renewed exchanges have dashed hopes for a lasting truce after a month-long war that has already killed over 2,000 people. By . mid morning Friday, Israel had launched about 20 airstrikes at Gaza, . while Gaza militants fired two rockets at Israel, the Israeli military . said. Earlier this week, . Hamas rejected an Egyptian truce proposal under which Israel would . gradually ease its blockade of Gaza, without giving specific . commitments. Down time: An Israel soldier takes a nap close to the machine gun on a tank's turret. There have been calls by hardliners in the Israeli government to increase military operations against Hamas . Relaxed: Israel soldiers sit in the shadow of a military vehicle. Israel's cabinet was reportedly considering calling up 10,000 reservists . Hamas demands a lifting of the border . closure, imposed by Israel and Egypt after the militant group's takeover . of the coastal strip in 2007. A . quick resumption of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Cairo . seems unlikely, particularly after Israel killed three top Hamas . military leaders in an airstrike Thursday. Yesterday, thousands of Palestinians marched . through Gaza today firing guns, waving flags of different militant . groups and chanting religious slogans in a funeral procession for the three leaders. The . bodies of Mohammed Abu Shamaleh, Mohammed Barhoum and Raed al-Attar . were carried aloft through the crowd on stretchers wrapped in green . Hamas flag before being buried in a cemetery. Intercepted: This picture shows the trail of a missile launched by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, designed to destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells . Incoming: Smoke trails rise above Gaza from rockets being being fired by Palestinian militants towards Israel . Since . Israel-Hamas fighting erupted on July 8, at least 2,086 Palestinians . were killed, according to Gaza health official Ashraf al-Kidra. Nearly a quarter of the dead - 469 - are children, according to the top UNICEF field officer in Gaza, Pernilla Ironside. Of . the more than 10,400 Palestinians wounded, nearly a third are children, . according to UNICEF figures, while some 100,000 Gazans have been left . homeless. Responding . to their deaths, senior Hamas political leader Ismail . Haniyeh said late Thursday that his group would not budge from its . demands. 'We will not . accept anything less than an end to the (Israeli) aggression and an end . to the blockade,' Haniyeh said in a statement posted by the . Hamas-affiliated Al Rai news service. 'Anyone involved in cease-fire efforts must understand that our people will not accept anything less than this.' Demolished: Palestinians gather around the rubble of a house that was destroyed in an Israeli air strike in the Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip . Carnage: Palestinians inspect the wreckage of a vehicle following an Israeli air strike in Gaza City. At least two were killed in the car outside a grocery shop . On the Israeli side, 67 people have been killed in the past six weeks, including 64 soldiers, two civilians and a Thai worker. One of Friday's airstrikes hit a livestock farm where two workers were killed, al-Kidra said. Three Palestinains were wounded in that strike. The Israeli military said its strikes targeted concealed rocket launchers and weapons sites. A Palestinian woman who was badly injured in the Gaza strip during the conflict with Israel arrives at a clinic in Westerstede, Germany for specialist treatment . Two Palestinian women and a nine-year-old girl (pictured) arrived at the clinic in Westerstede, Germany, for free emergency treatment as part of an initiative by the Palestinian surgeon Muneer Deeb . Israel said the three Hamas senior figures killed on Thursday had played a key role in expanding the militants' military capabilities in recent years, including digging attack tunnels leading to Israel, training fighters and smuggling weapons to Gaza. One of the trio also played a role in the capture of Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit in 2006. After being held captive in Gaza for more than five years, Schalit was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011. Israel says the Gaza blockade is needed to prevent Hamas and other militant groups from getting weapons. The restrictions prevent most Gazans from traveling outside the crowded coastal strip and bar most exports.",

        "article": "Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Amman on Thursday to discuss recent developments in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, officials said. Netanyahu returned to Israel after the discussions, which also looked at economic cooperation between the two countries and other regional matters, one of his representatives said. \"The Prime Minister emphasized that Israel places a premium on security arrangements, including Jordan's interests, in any future agreement that will take into consideration the peace treaty between Jordan and Israel, signed 20 years ago,\" Netanyahu's media adviser said. The meeting follows U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's recent visit to the region. Kerry met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu in hopes of working out a framework agreement for the resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. A statement from Jordan's royal court said the meeting came in the framework of \"continuous consultation and coordination between the King and all the parties involved in the peace process, considering His Majesty's keenness on achieving tangible progress that meets the aspirations of the Palestinian people and at the same time protects the high interests of the Jordanian kingdom.\" During his visit to Jerusalem this month, Kerry met multiple times with Abbas and Netanyahu. He declined to share details of the conversations with reporters but told them that progress was being made during the trip. Kerry has floated a proposal based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. Defense minister comments . Earlier this week, U.S. officials reacted angrily to comments attributed to Israel's defense minister criticizing Kerry's efforts to broker a peace agreement. The derisive remarks appeared in a popular daily Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronot, and reflect Moshe Yaalon's skepticism of the Kerry-led U.S. efforts \"both in private conversations in Israel and in the U.S.\" \"American Secretary of State John Kerry, who turned up here determined and acting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor, cannot teach me anything about the conflict with the Palestinians,\" Yaalon said, according to the paper. Yaalon later issued an apology in a written statement sent to the media from the Defense Ministry. Kerry defies the odds with intense drive for Middle East peace .

        "article": "A 91-year-old war veteran who smothered his ailing wife to end her suffering has been released from prison early after serving six months. Robert Shaw was sentenced to four years behind bars last June after pleading guilty to\u00a0involuntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal in the death of his wife of 65 years, Virginia, in 2008. On Tuesday, Lorain County Judge Mark Betleski\u00a0granted him early release for good behavior and the grandfather left Pickaway Correctional Institution in Orient, Ohio. 'There was no question in my mind as I'm going through the process that this was a man who made a tortured decision,' Betleski told\u00a0NewsNet5 after the hearing. Scroll down for video . Freed: 91-year-old Robert Shaw, pictured in court last summer, has been released from prison in Ohio after serving six months behind bars for smothering his ailing wife of 65 years to end her suffering . Shaw, who has been in poor health himself, will be on probation for two years after his release and will live with family members, his defense attorney Kenneth Lieux said at the hearing, the Chronicle-Telegram\u00a0reported. The family had requested for him to be released, he said. Shaw, who struggled to hear the court hearing as he appeared via video link, had been eligible for release after serving six months as part of last year's plea deal. Lieux added that Shaw, who had never been in trouble with the law before the killing, has not had any infractions in prison and even worked a job behind bars. He was initially charged with aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault for the killing because mercy killings are illegal in Ohio. Euthanasia is illegal in the US but a handful of states - Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Montana - do allow physician-assisted suicide in some instances. 'The law is black and white, but we\u2019re all humans,' the judge added to NewsNet5. Shaw, who fought at the Battle of the Bulge in Europe and was retired from a job in truck manufacturing, smothered his 84-year-old wife, Virginia, as she lay in bed on November 13, 2008. He then phoned a 911 operator and said: 'I just killed my wife.' Scene: He used a towel to smother his wife Virginia at their Avon, Ohio home (pictured) in 2008 after she had spent the previous few months in and out of hospital. He then called 911 to report what he had done . On the recording, Shaw can be heard saying he wanted 'to put her out of her misery'. He went on: 'She had been in and out of the hospital and came home a couple of months ago, and... uh... I can't talk ...' Police arrived through an unlocked door to find Shaw sitting at a table. He told officers that they could find his wife in the bedroom. The Lorain County Coroner said she appeared to die by asphyxiation. At the hearing on Tuesday,\u00a0Assistant County Prosecutor Chris Pierre warned that Shaw could pose a risk to the community. 'I hope the defendant understands he does not have the right to decide when to end someone's life,' he told the judge. See below for video .",

        "article": "Following the ban of social media site Twitter in Turkey last week, today video website Youtube has also been blocked in the country. The ban comes after Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was quoted by Reuters at a rally last week saying: 'I don't understand how people of good sense could defend this Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. There are all kinds of lies there.' Google has confirmed reports that some users have been unable to access the site. It is thought that some internet users in the country can still access Youtube. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan banned Twitter last week. Today reports that Youtube is now blocked in Turkey have emerged from the country . The video website has been blocked after voice recordings of senior officials discussing a potential military operation in Syria have flooded the site - it\u00a0 is believed. Government officials confirmed today that more social media platforms could be blocked if national security was threatened. At a rally today, the Prime Minister described the fact that the audio had been posted on Youtube as 'villainous'. A source at the Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said today that the videos had caused 'a national security issue'. The source said that Turkey was in talks with the video sharing platform and may lift the ban if YouTube agreed to remove the content. Turkey's courts blocked access to Twitter last week following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow, on . the campaign trail ahead of key March 30 local elections, to 'wipe out' the service. The Twitter ban was lifted yesterday. In a defiant stand, Mr Erdogan said he did not care what the . international community had to say about the move. People across the country have today tweeted pictures of their computer screens featuring the blocked Youtube message. Journalist Jonathon Burch, tweeting from Turkey, posted this picture on his Twitter page earlier today. Amnesty International also tweeted about the ban today. The charity wrote: '#Turkey moves to block Youtube, after cutting off Twitter. Will Facebook be next?' Mr Erdogan spoke at a rally today in Diyarbakir, one of the largest cities in southeastern Turkey. He slammed opponents for leaking an audio tape on Youtube of a security meeting discussing potential military action in Syria . Youtube logos on a computer screen partially covered with Turkey's national flag . Last week, Turkey's Prime Minister used the expression 'Twitter, mwitter!,' to describe the social media website to thousands of rally supporters. The phrase can be translated roughly as 'Twitter, schmitter!' 'The international community can say this, can say that. I don't care at all. Everyone will see how powerful the Republic of Turkey is,' Mr Erdogan said. Links on social networks have proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime Minister and other top officials in corruption. This computer screen shows blocked access to Twitter last week . Last week, some users found a way of getting around the Twitter ban by using Google's DNS tool. The tool allows internet users to browse from another domain name system. A DNS transforms the name of a website into a series of numbers known as an IP address. Twitter users in Turkey circulated the alternative DNS address 8.8.8.8 on social media. Graffiti with the words has also appeared on a wall in the country. A logo with the Twitter symbol and the words #DirenTwitter and its English translation #OccupyTwitter also went viral. #Turkey was once again trending today following the Youtube block in the country. The Prime Minister, who . has been in power for 11 years, is battling a corruption scandal that . has been fed by social media awash with alleged evidence of government . wrongdoing. Links on social networks have . proliferated linking to recordings that appear to incriminate the Prime . Minister and other top officials in corruption. Street graffiti in Turkey with the DNS code that allows internet users to access Twitter . A campaign opposing the Twitter ban went viral in Turkey. These posters contain the alternative DNS address for Twitter from a computer in Turkey as well as the hashtag which has gone viral. #Turkey was trending today on the social media website . Turkey has blocked access to . Youtube in the past, last week was the first ban on social media website Twitter. The social network was instrumental in organizing flash protests against . the government last year. Uproar over the recordings has damaged the government's reputation ahead of local elections this month. Despite the ban, tech-savvy users managed to tweet links to the recordings last Friday. President Abdullah Gul, a political ally of Erdogan's, was among those who circumvented the order, which he contested in a series of tweets. Turkish President Abdullah Gul has blasted the ban and continued tweeting from his page today . The country's President Abdullah Gul said that it was unacceptable to impose complete bans on social media platforms such as Twitter. 'I hope this implementation won't last long,' he wrote. 'One cannot approve of the complete closure of social media platforms,' Mr . Gul tweeted. He said only individual Internet pages should be blocked if . there is a court order on the grounds that a person's privacy is being . violated. Mr Gul co-founded the ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party with Erdogan and has . remained a close ally. But he is viewed as a more conciliatory figure . than the combative Prime Minister and their relations have at times . appeared strained. Mr Erdogan's ruling AK Party has already tightened Internet controls, . handed government more influence over the courts, and reassigned . thousands of police and hundreds of prosecutors and judges as it fights a . corruption scandal he has cast as a plot by political enemies to oust . him. Many - although not all - users trying to access the network early on Friday instead saw a notice from Turkey's telecommunications authority, citing four court orders. The site was blocked early this morning in Turkey . Turkey's lawyers' association asked a court to overturn the ban, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated Turkish and European human rights laws. Turkey's main opposition party also said it would seek a cancellation. Twitter's (at)policy account sent out messages telling Turkish users in both English and Turkish they could send out tweets by using short message service, or 'SMS.' It was unclear how those tweets would be viewable. Telecoms . watchdog BTK said the social media platform had been blocked by the . courts after complaints were made by citizens that it was breaching . privacy. It said Twitter had ignored previous requests to remove . content. 'Because there was no other choice, access to Twitter was . blocked in line with court decisions to avoid the possible future . victimization of citizens,' it said. European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes criticized the Twitter ban in Turkey - a country that is seeking to join the European Union - as 'groundless, pointless, cowardly.' Stefan Fule, the EU commissioner in charge of enlargement, said he was concerned. Lutfi Elvan, the minister in charge of transport and communications in Turkey, said his office was merely obeying court orders. President Abdullah Gul continued using Twitter despite the ban. His last Tweet was sent at 9.35am . Chancellor Angela Merkel's government criticised Turkey saying the ban did not fit with Germany's view of freedom of expression. 'What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,' said Mrs Merkel's spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz. 'It doesn't fit with our idea of freedom of expression to forbid or block any form of communication,' she added. In response to the Twitter ban in Turkey, Dr Paul Dwyer, social media expert from the University of Westminster, said: 'President Erdogan said, when he attempted to close down access to Twitter, \u2018everyone will see how powerful Turkey is\u2019. 'In fact, of course, he has simply demonstrated how powerful Twitter is. 'Social media are a part of politics - and everything else we do. And so we must learn to use them well and for good, otherwise we will find ourselves, as President Erdogan now does, out of touch with the modern world.'",

The all-British line-up resembles a modern day Rat Pack with all of the players wearing black tie - although Frank Sinatra and Co are unlikely to have been impressed by Gibbs' choice of jeans. (L-R) Aaron Ramsey, Kieran Gibbs, Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers get into the swing of things at Arsenbal's Christmas party . Alexis Sanchez looks at the camera as he serenades Lukas Podolski with an impressive display on the piano . The Chilean forward performed Richard Marx's 'Right Here Waiting' to his Arsenal team-mate . Also flexing his musical muscles last week was Sanchez who serenaded team-mate Lukas Podolski with a surprisingly impressive piano performance. The Chilean forward, who joined Arsenal in the summer from Barcelona, performed Richard Marx's 'Right Here Waiting' to Podolski, who then uploaded a video to social media site Instagram. Dressed in an all-black suit, Sanchez looked as comfortable in front of a piano as he does on the pitch at the Emirates. Yaya Sanogo, Francis Coquelin, Mesut Ozil, Mathieu Flamini, Lukas Podolski and Alexis Sanchez (left-right) get ready for a sit-down dinner as the Arsenal team enjoy their Christmas party . Alongside the video, Podolski wrote the message, 'Was great to be serenaded by my bro Alexis! #Christmas #Alexis #Poldi #Bro #multitalented #serenaded'. The Arsenal squad enjoyed a lavish meal at their second Christmas party, with a number of first-team players posting pictures of their evening online. The Gunners have had a stuttering start to this season's Premier League campaign and will finish the year in fifth place. They face Southampton at St Mary's on New Year's Day, where three points can take them a step closer to the holy grail of a Champions League place.

        "article": "Mitt Romney is still in the 'maybe' category for the 2016 presidential sweepstakes, judging from an interview published  Tuesday. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 also-ran said his thinking on a third try for the White House has boiled down to a line from the Jim Carrey movie 'Dumb and Dumber.' In the movie, Carrey's goofy character Lloyd Christmas is spurned by a love interest who says there's a one-in-a-million chance she would be with him. 'So,' he replies hopefully: 'You're telling me there's a chance?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Will he or won't he? Mitt Romney doesn't seem to know yet, and is playing the speculation game as well as he can . Romney trounces the Republcian field in early Iowa polling, but will he follow through? Romney is playing along with the media's relentless will-he-or-won't-he curiosity \u2013 he told radio host Hugh Hewitt last month that he's not planning to run but 'circumstances can change' \u2013 but he's keeping his cards close to his vest. Officially, he's not running. 'I love the country enough to know that I'm not as good a candidate this time around as I think the other guys would be,' he told Hewitt. 'I want the country to win. I do not want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president.' But unofficially, he's staying in touch with his 2012 team of aides and consultants. Asked if he identified personally with the Jim Carrey quote, Romney would only tell The New York Times, 'I have nothing to add to the story.' But then came the latest non-denial-denial: 'We've got a lot of people looking at the race. We\u2019ll see what happens.' Jennifer Rubin . Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin assembled a list of 15 reasons why Mitt Romney should sit out 2016 and remain the GOP's elder statesman, including: . The long-time pol's wife Ann said during a Fox News Channel\u00a0interview on Sept. 23 that 'Mitt and I are not making plans.' But when host Neil Cavuto pointed out that Ronald Reagan only won the presidency after failing twice, she smiled. 'Well, we will see, won't we, Neil?' Mrs. Romney said. If former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush were to throw his hat into the ring, she suggested, it might preclude a Mitt three-fer since the two men would compete for the same centrist, non-tea-party base. But in a late August poll of likely Republican voters in Iowa, Bush came in a disappointing fifth place out of a field of 13 potential candidates, with barely 7 per cent support. Placing ahead of him were Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rick Perry and 'undecided.' When Romney's name was added as a 14th option in the poll, he crushed the competition with more than 35 per cent. Bush shrank to below a 5 per cent showing \u2013 7th place. As his poll numbers go up, Romney is attracting a dedicated cadre of true believers who are eager to capitalize on the buyer's remorse of disaffected Obama voters. More than 120,000 of them have clicked the approval of a 'Draft Mitt' petition, but that support may be soft: The draft committee's Twitter account\u00a0has just 173 followers. And for every die-hard Mitt backer, there seems to be an equal and opposite detractor. The naysayers tend to have the biggest megaphones. Tanned, rested and ready: More than 120,000 Americans have signed an online petition encouraging the 2012 also-ran to take a third plunge into presidential politics . Jennifer Rubin, The left-leaning Washington Post's resident center-right columnist, opined Monday night that Romney should stay away from the 2016 race for the good of the Republican Party. Romney 'was right about a host of issues, most especially on foreign policy,' she wrote. 'His obvious prowess as an executive is badly needed in the White House.' 'I find it nearly impossible to believe he wouldn\u2019t have been a better choice for the country than President Obama has been. But he should not run for president a third time.' What followed was a list of 15 reasons Romney should retire gracefully, or perhaps tee himself up as a potential Treasury Secretary appointee. Chief among them: 'In promoting an anti-elitism message, the GOP has the upper hand against Hillary \u2013 unless Romney runs.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- At one time, teens Carlos Gonzalez, 16, and Juan Carlos Echeverri, 15, were classmates at Cathedral High School in El Paso, Texas. Like many who live along the border, both boys had strong ties to El Paso, and especially to neighboring Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. That's where they found themselves on Saturday, where they were gunned down at a car dealership by unknown assailants. Gonzalez and Echeverri were both U.S. citizens, the Cathedral principal told CNN. A third youth, 16-year-old Cesar Miramontes of Juarez was also killed in the incident. \"Like many kids involved in this border reality of straddling two cultures, he had a lot of stress about what's going on in Juarez,\" the high school principal, Brother Nick Gonzalez, said of Gonzalez. The two are not related. The young Gonzalez, the principal said, was \"mischievous, but a good kid.\" His family, which had lived in Juarez, had recently started renting an apartment in El Paso for safety reasons. Juarez is a flashpoint in the drug cartel turf wars that have left thousands dead over the past four years. There were more than 3,000 killings recorded in Juarez alone in 2010. Moving to the United States, for any child, is a cultural shift, and \"I think he struggled with that,\" the principal said. Echeverri went to school with Gonzalez at Cathedral their freshman year, before he returned to Juarez to attend school there, the principal said. The shooting happened at 4:22 p.m. Saturday at a car dealership, where the teens were looking at cars, said Arturo Sandoval, spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Police recovered at least 18 bullet casings at the scene from an AK-47, an automatic weapon commonly used by drug traffickers in the city. \"We believe (Echeverri) and the two others had been friends for a long time. He was here in the city to visit them,\" Sandoval said. Virginia Staab, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Monday that U.S. authorities are actively looking into the incident and had not yet confirmed the citizenship of any of the victims. Even though the killings happened in Juarez, they re-open wounds for the students and the community of El Paso, Nick Gonzalez, the principal, said. Seemingly everyone knows someone who has been killed, extorted, kidnapped or robbed, he said. Just because the violence is on the Mexican side of the border, doesn't make it a Mexican problem, he said. \"It is not a 'them' problem, it is an 'us' problem. We need to find out how to help kids cope,\" he said. \"Just because there is a border doesn't mean that the emotions and pain don't cross over.\" Monday's killings marked the first time that a current student at Cathedral High School was killed in the Juarez violence. But alumni have been killed before, and, just before Christmas, the father of a student -- a successful orthopedic surgeon in Juarez -- was kidnapped and killed. The fatal shootings come on the heels of numerous similar violent incidents in recent months in Juarez. In one 48-hour span last week, for instance, at least 14 people were killed -- including a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted due to her job, according to Juarez Police spokesman Adrian Sanchez.",

        "article": "By . Lucy Waterlow and Louise Eccles . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 8 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:43 EST, 8 May 2013 . Simon Cowell once ordered Cheryl Cole to get rid of her \u2018crazy hair\u2019 \u2013 but it seems that the majority of women disagree. The singer\u2019s wavy brunette hair is the most copied celebrity hairstyle in the UK, according to a study.The second most requested style is This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby\u2019s sleek honey-coloured locks, according to hairdressers Toni & Guy. Model Kelly Brook\u2019s loosely curled hairdo came third in the poll of 2,000 women, while fourth place went to the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s glossy blow-dried curls. Friends actress Jennifer Aniston, whose famous \u2018Rachel cut\u2019 inspired millions of women, was fifth with her current layered cut. Luscious locks: Cheryl Cole's long, brunette style is the most copied in the UK while women also wanted her look when she dyed her hair red, right . Sacha Mascolo-Tarbuck, of Toni & . Guy, said: \u2018Cheryl\u2019s long brunette hair has been popular for some time . now. You can wear it in curls one day, straight the next and in a smart . up-do for a night out. Perhaps that\u2019s why they are so popular with . women.\u2019 Cole, who models for L\u2019Oreal hair . products, features twice in the list, with her short-lived dyed-red . hairstyle coming in sixth place. But the pop star\u2019s hair has attracted more than its fair share of controversy in the past. She was accused of misleading fans by . taking part in a national advertising campaign for L\u2019Oreal Elvive Full . Restore 5 shampoo and conditioner, showing off impossibly shiny hair \u2013 . which turned out to be the result of \u00a31,000 hair extensions. In 2009 the Advertising Standards . Authority said it received 13 complaints that the adverts were . misleading, but rejected them because the disclaimer about Miss Cole\u2019s . hair extensions was \u2018clear and legible\u2019 on the commercial. Equally controversial was the . dramatic, back-combed hairstyle that Cole sported for the launch of her . ill-fated career as a judge on American X Factor in 2011. According to Miss Cole, Cowell, who . fired her just two weeks into the show amid \u2018concerns over her image\u2019, . told her after the first day of filming: \u2018The crazy hair goes tomorrow.\u2019 The survey also found that a third of women have asked their hairdresser . to recreate the same cut or colour as their favourite celebrity. Runners up: Holly Willoughby's blonde locks, left, and Kelly Brooks brunette waves are also popular requests in UK salons . Mascolo-Tarbuck added: 'The hair styles featured at the top of the list are very versatile and can be made to look different fairly easily. 'We see millions of women each year requesting hair similar to celebrities, from Cheryl, Holly and Kelly\u2019s classic looks right through to Rihanna\u2019s or Rita Ora\u2019s more daring styles. 'It will be interesting to see who the next big celebrity inspiration will be.' Hair idols: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Jennifer Aniston were also in the top ten . Fourth in the poll of 2,000 women was mother-to-be Kate Middleton whose brunette, slightly wavy hair has been coveted ever since her 2011 wedding to Prince William thrust her into the spotlight. Meanwhile former Friends actress Jennifer Aniston\u2019s long layered hair still remains an inspiration for millions of women years after her famous 'Rachel cut', as she was voted fifth place. Cheryl Cole\u2019s brief change from her signature hairstyle - mahogany-coloured waves - is at number six, followed by Cameron Diaz\u2019s short, choppy look. TV\u2019s New Girl star Zooey Deschanel came eighth in the poll thanks to her heavy fringe and while Kim Kardashian\u2019s dark, glossy hair is at nine. Anne Hathaway\u2019s short pixie crop, which she cut as part of her role in Oscar winning film Les Miserables, completed the top ten. Other celebrities to feature in the list include The Saturday\u2019s singer Frankie Sandford with her asymmetrical pixie crop and Jessie J\u2019s sharp bob. Wanna be like you: Zooey Deschanel's fringe, left, and Anne Hathaway's pixie crop are commonly copied . Supermodel Cara Delavigne\u2019s long blonde locks, Gwen Stefani\u2019s platinum hue and Harry Potter\u2019s Emma Watson and her pixie cut are also among the most common hairstyles requested by women. Researchers also revealed that a third of women have walked into a hairdressers and asked to be given the exact same cut or colour as their favourite celebrity. And almost four in ten regularly use pictures of a star\u2019s hairstyle for inspiration when they are looking for a new look. Fifteen per cent even admitted they would change their hair colour or style if their favourite celebrity did. But another 15 per cent said they had changed their hair cut or colour to look less like a celebrity while 17 per cent have regretted copying the style of someone famous.",

Bishop Richard Williamson dismissed the lawyer, Wolfram Nahrath, on orders from his superior, Nicholas Wansbutter told CNN late Wednesday. Nahrath told CNN earlier that he had been hired to help Williamson appeal his conviction, which stemmed from doubting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's intention to murder Jews and denying the existence of gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The appeal was originally scheduled to begin next week but was delayed indefinitely because of the change of lawyers, Nahrath said. Nahrath would not say when he was hired and would not comment on his political affiliations. He did not say he had been fired and did not respond to CNN requests for comment about the matter Thursday. The German Interior Ministry said Nahrath was the leader of the far-right Wiking Jugend until authorities banned the group in 1994. Williamson was in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime, when he made the remarks in an interview with Swedish television. The comments came shortly before Pope Benedict XVI lifted an excommunication on him and three other ultraconservative bishops. The Vatican said Benedict was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when the excommunication was lifted, and the pope ordered Williamson to recant. The excommunication was not related to his Holocaust denial. Williamson was convicted of Holocaust denial in April. He did not appear in court to fight the charges. Nahrath's father and grandfather led the Wiking Jugend before he did, according to the anti-extremist group Netz-gegen-Nazis. It said the Wiking Jugend was an imitation of the Hitler Youth, a group set up by Hitler to teach Nazi principles to children. Williamson's order, the ultra-conservative Society of St. Pius X, distanced itself from his decision to hire Nahrath. The order's superior general, Bishop Bernard Fellay, threatened to expel Williamson from the society if he stuck with his lawyer.",

A married couple from Brooklyn Heights has adopted the four-month-old kittens, Arthur and August, who were previously being cared for at an animal foster home, according to Richard Gentles, spokesman for Animal Care & Control of NYC. Katherine and Keith Lubeley are the proud new parents, and they say the kittens are adapting to their new home pretty quickly. \"They're adjusting to the spaciousness,\" Keith Lubeley said. \"We've been introducing them room by room.\" According to Gentles, the kitties were sheltered for about two months before they were eligible for adoption. \"One was a little underweight, and both kittens needed to be socialized,\" he explained. The fearless felines shut down about six miles of track on two subway lines in Brooklyn after they were spotted wandering in the subway system on August 29. The New York Police Department sent officers to the scene for crowd control as trains stopped running for about 90 minutes. According to the Animal Care & Control of NYC, Arthur, a tabby, and August, who has a solid black coat, are arguably the most famous kittens in New York City history, although not much is known about their origins. \"From what we can tell, they are brothers from the same litter,\" Keith Lubeley said. \"They seem to be good partners and they are definitely playful.\" Animal Care & Control of NYC received a lot of inquiries and applications from people to adopt the cats, Gentles told CNN. But the Lubeleys \"really impressed our adoption counselors,\" he said. \"We are very, very happy.\" CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.",

        "article": "MUMBAI, India (CNN)  -- In the U.S., the film \"Slumdog Millionaire\" barely escaped going straight to video before it caught the eye of moviegoers and critics alike, becoming a sleeper hit and best picture nominee. It's viewed by many observers as the film to beat at the 81st annual Academy Awards. Danny Boyle, left, celebrates with actor Anil Kapoor, right, at the Mumbai premiere of \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" In the city where the movie was shot, Mumbai, India, the recognition came much quicker and more enthusiastically. The Mumbai premiere had all the makings of a scene from a Bollywood blockbuster: Musicians banged on traditional Indian drums as the cast and crew broke into dance on the red carpet in recognition of the 10 Academy Award nominations the film received Thursday. \"It feels like a million nominations,\" said director Danny Boyle, who earned one of the nominations.  Watch scenes from the Mumbai premiere \u00bb . Bollywood legend Anil Kapoor, who stars as the host of the Indian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" in the movie, said he was with Boyle when the nominations were announced. \"Danny had tears in his eyes, and I couldn't control myself,\" Kapoor said.  Watch Kapoor rave about the film \u00bb . But not everyone was celebrating. The film, about a Mumbai orphan seeking fame and love through the \"Millionaire\" game show, has stirred strong emotions among some Indian critics. They found the word \"slumdog\" in the title insulting and complained that the movie romanticizes poverty in India. Film critic Meenakshi Shedde said she was disappointed with the movie. \"What saddened me and annoyed me about the film is that it's a laundry list of India's miseries,\" she said. \"The poverty, the child labor, the beggary, the prostitution, that part of it was just banal, I thought.\" According to the Press Trust of India, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan -- who once hosted the Indian version of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" -- recently cleared the air with Boyle regarding Bachchan's reported criticism of the Golden Globe-winning film. Such negativity was forgotten at the Mumbai premiere, which was attended by several Bollywood celebrities. They said the event marked a proud day for Indian cinema. Loveleen Tandan, who was the film's casting director, said the entire cast was exhilarated by news of the Academy Award nominations. As for her whether she believed \"Slumdog Millionaire\" had a chance at the Oscars, she expressed confidence. \"Now I can say it openly, I have high hopes,\" she said. \"I am sure there's a statue waiting for A.R. Rahman [who composed the film's music and received three nominations] to bring home.\" CNN's Mallika Kapur contributed to this report.",

        "article": "By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . PUBLISHED: . 13:49 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:15 EST, 4 March 2014 . Each morning residents of the east India state of Assam watch the sun rise more than 90 minutes earlier than the west of the country. This is because time on the clocks across India are set to be exactly the same in each of its states and provinces, regardless of location. The result is a huge discrepancy between the time shown on the clock and where the sun is in the sky \u2013 a problem that this map reveals is widespread throughout the world. Click on the the image to enlarge it... This map shows the difference between clock time and 'solar time'. The 'late' places are shown in red, the 'early' places in green. The deeper the shade, the more out of sync time is . The map, created by Google engineer Stefano Maggiolo, highlights the huge differences between solar time and clock-time in large parts of our planet. Mr Maggiolo said that the map was inspired by a trip to Spain, whose time zone means that Madrid's sunset is more than an hour later than that of Naples. This is because of the latitude and Earth\u2019s tilt as it moves around the sun causing solar daysto\u00a0 vary throughout the year. \u2018The modern calendar compensates by letting midday oscillate a bit around the year,\u2019 explains Mr Maggiolo, in his blog. Large parts of the U.S. and Canada have a discrepancy of around an hour between solar time and clock time . Mr Maggiolo said that the map was inspired by a trip to Spain, whose time zone means that Madrid's sunset is more than an hour later than that of Naples . A solar day is the length of time between the sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times. The length of a solar day varies . throughout the year, and the accumulated effect of these variations . produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes. This is because of Earth's tilt and its elliptical orbit as it moves around the sun. The Earth moves fastest when it is closest to the sun\u00a0 and slowest when it is furthest away. This 'unequal motion' causes variations in the length of the solar day and in the times of sunrise and sunset. For example, midday in Naples goes from 11:47 in early November to 12:17 in early February. The map reveals that the sun rises and sets later in the day than it should in a larger part of the world, with the late places shown in red and the early places in green. Most of Russia is heavily red, but mostly in zones with very scarce population. The exception is St. Petersburg, with a discrepancy of two hours. \u2018It seems strange that time systems with such a huge problem had ever been practical,\u2019 notes Mr Maggiolo. \u2018But in the pre-industrial-revolution world travels were so uncommon and slow that this problem was no more than a minor annoyance.\u2019 The change from solar time, where all days have different lengths, to solar meantime, where midday wanders around 12:00, came about due to the increase in mechanical clocks in the 19th century. The development of rapid railway systems and the consequent confusion of schedules that used scores of different local times led to the introduction of time zones as we know them. \u2018Indeed, if we acknowledge that the two problems must be solved, the natural result is the current time zone system,\u2019 said Mr Maggiolo. The sun rises earlier in some parts of western Australia as shown by the green in this map. This is because the length of a solar day varies throughout the year, and the accumulated effect of these variations  produces seasonal deviations of up to 16 minutes . This might go some way to explain why people in Spain tend to stay up later. The country\u2019s time zone puts it an hour ahead of the UK despite being on the same longitude . \u2018The immediate consequence is that in the western part of the time zone the sun rises and sets later than in the eastern part,\u2019 said Mr Maggiolo. \u2018Normally, these differences amount to at most half an hour in either direction, but human geography sometime forces greater differences.\u2019 Politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map. For instance, in China all the clocks are set to Beijing time. This means in the western part of the country, marked in deep red on the map, solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon. In Xinjiang province, the Uighur minority makes a point of observing its own time and not that of local Han Chinese. Politics also comes into play for some of the discrepancies seen in the map. For instance, in China all the clocks are set to Beijing time. This means in the western part of the country, marked in deep red on the map, solar noon takes place at three in the afternoon .",

After taking the subway to a news\u00a0conference\u00a0this afternoon, he said: 'I have a simple message for\u00a0our New Yorkers: There is no threat to our subway system.' New York Police Commissioner Bratton said the NYPD has put increased resources toward protecting subways and rail stations and there will be more police patrols on the streets, but insisted the people of the city should feel 'comfortable and secure' using the travel network.

Reassurances: New York governor Andrew Cuomo reassured commuters the subway was same from a platform . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (left) and New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton arrive at the press conference after taking the subway.\u00a0New York Police Commissioner Bratton said the NYPD has put increased resources toward protecting subways and rail stations and there will be more police patrols . They were responding to claims by the Iraqi Prime Minister this morning that ISIS militants are planning to carry out terror attacks on the New York and Paris subways. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi today claimed to have\u00a0received 'credible' information from intelligence officials in Baghdad that foreign fighters belonging to ISIS were plotting attacks. National Security Council spokesman Caitlin Hayden said:\u00a0\u00a0'We have not confirmed such a plot, and would have to review any information from our Iraqi partners before making further determinations We take any threat seriously and always work to corroborate information we receive from our partners.' Mr Abadi made his remarks at a meeting with journalists on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York today. He said that the suspects included Islamic extremists originally from the United States and France who have been fighting alongside ISIS terrorists in Iraq. Threat: Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he was told of the plot by intelligence officials in Baghdad, and that it was the work of extremists originally from the U.S. and France who have been fighting for ISIS . Radicals: ISIS supporters slogans as they carry the group's flags in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, Iraq. Militants in the country are suspected of plotting the New York and Paris attacks . 'Today, while I am here, I am receiving accurate reports . from Baghdad where there was [the] arrest of [a] few elements . and there are networks planning from inside Iraq to have . attacks,' he said. 'They plan to have attacks in the metros of Paris and the . U.S.,' he added, speaking in English. 'From the details I have received, yes it looks . credible.' 'They are not Iraqis. Some of them are French, some of them are Americans. But they are in Iraq,' Mr Abadi went on to say. His claims were quickly slapped down by U.S. officials, however. 'We've seen the reports of Prime Minister Abadi's comments. We have not confirmed such a plot, and would have to review any information from our Iraqi partners before making further determinations,' said\u00a0Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson for the\u00a0U.S. National Security Council. 'We take any threat seriously and always work to corroborate information we receive from our partners. We're obviously very focused on the issue of foreign fighters, as you saw evidenced yesterday at the Security Council session the President chaired, she added. Force: A handout picture made available by the US Department of Defense today shows a formation of US Navy F-18E Super Hornets refueling having carried out airstrikes on targets linked to ISIS . Allies: Last Friday French President Francois Hollande (left) ordered his country's air force to carry out attacks on ISIS targets in Iraq. In doing so, France joined a 'broad coalition' of nations agreeing to support plans by U.S. president Barack Obama (right) to 'degrade and eventually destroy' the terrorist group . Strikes: A U.S.-led coalition opened airstrikes inside Syria on Monday, expanding weeks of attacks by the United States on Islamic State targets in Iraq . The Iraqi Prime Minister said that he received the information from intelligence officials based in Baghdad earlier this morning. In addition to the brutality Islamic State has visited on the people of Iraq and Syria, western leaders have voiced concern that the group would turn its terror operations outside the region. A U.S.-led coalition opened airstrikes inside Syria on Monday, expanding weeks of attacks by the United States on Islamic State targets in Iraq. A fresh wave of airstrikes from the United States and its Arab allies hit ISIS oil refineries overnight, killing at least 14 militants and striking at the heart of the terror group's funding. ISIS generates up to $2million a day from the sale of oil, employing highly trained engineers to extract thousands of barrels a day from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq under the terror group's control. Thousands of Algerian soldiers supported by helicopters are hunting for the ISIS-linked Islamist terrorists who beheaded a French mountaineer in a sickening video released yesterday. Herve Gourdel, 55, was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after he arrived in Algeria for a 10-day walking holiday. Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday, less than 24 hours after militants uploaded a video to YouTube warning that the married father-of-two would be killed unless France pulled out of a coalition of nations bombing targets connected to the ISIS in Iraq. Murdered: Herve Gourdel, 55, (pictured right, holding a water bottle) was captured by the Islamist group Jund al-Khilifa while hiking in the Djurdjura National Park on Sunday - just one day after arriving for a walking holiday . Execution: ISIS-linked militants in Algeria beheaded  Herve Gourdel yesterday after he was captured at the weekend. The group earlier made threats to kill Mr Gourdel if France did not stop bombing targets in Iraq . By early this morning some 2000 soldiers were involved in the search in the Tizi Ouzou region, along with 500 marines supported by sniffers dogs. 'Everything will be done to bring the killers to justice,' said a spokesman for Algeria's Defence Ministry. The news came as\u00a0France's defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian revealed his country is considering whether to expand airstrikes into Syria to assist a U.S. and Arab coalition in thwarting ISIS' advances. There are 30,000 French citizens living in Algeria, where Mr Gourdel was brutally murdered yesterday by militants loyal to ISIS - the terror group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi which controls a swath of territory larger than Britain and a population of four million brutally oppressed citizens. Asked about the  French citizens living in Algeria, Mr Le Drian told RTL radio that the goal of the extremist groups is to 'spread terror. Experienced: Mr Gourdel was a professional mountaineering guide and amateur photographer. Although he enjoyed spending time in remote locations around the world, he was always extremely careful, friends said . Grieving: This morning tributes were paid to murdered professional mountaineering guide Herve Gourdel by locals in his home city of Nice, where a book of condolence was opened in his memory . The Algerian government last night reiterated its commitment to protecting foreign residents living inside the country. There are fears that other radical Islamist groups may carry out copycat attacks on Westerners following calls to do so by ISIS on Sunday. The kidnapping and murder of Gourdel, however, is believed to be a crime of opportunity, since Algeria's extremist have been confined to remote mountainous regions and the French mountaineer was one of only a very few foreigners to venture into this area. This morning tributes were paid to the professional mountaineering guide, both from politicians and from locals in his home city of Nice, where a book of condolence was opened in his memory. Mr Gourdel - a passionate amateur photographer - was a married father of two adult children.",

When three of their cats vanished without trace, the Wilcocksons thought they had simply run away. Their devastated children searched the neighbourhood and stuck up posters to try to track them down. But when \u2013 several months later \u2013 they found another one of their pets trapped in a cage, the family realised there was a more sinister reason behind their disappearance. 'Not proud': Gordon Wilson (left) baited a home-made trap with tuna to capture pets including Pip (right) Their neighbour, Gordon Wilson, 74, had been baiting a home-made trap with tuna to capture the pets before releasing them into the countryside. The pensioner hated the animals for fouling his immaculate garden. Only one of the pets that he captured managed to return home \u2013 and he was so disorientated by the experience that he later got run over and died. Two of the family\u2019s cats remain missing, but there seems little hope that they will be found. Joanne Wilcockson, 27, has lived two doors away from Wilson in Hunmanby, North Yorkshire, all her life, and used to go to his house as a child to play with his Jack Russell puppies. So when three of her cats went missing in as many days in April, she never suspected he was behind it. Home-made: The trap that Wilson used to capture the cats before releasing them into the countryside . Pumpkin, a three-year-old black and white tom, was the first to go. The same thing happened to their second tom, Morris, and their tortoiseshell cat Pansy, both of whom were little more than kittens. Distraught children Ryan, eight, and Isaac, five, made posters and leaflets to distribute locally, but to no avail. Although Pumpkin did return home, he was \u2018confused\u2019 and was run over by a car shortly afterwards \u2013 leaving the family with just one cat called Patience. Over the summer, Mrs Wilcockson and her factory worker husband, Sean, decided to get another cat, a ginger tom they called Pip. When he didn\u2019t return home one evening in October, Mr Wilcockson went to search and found him trapped in the cage at 1am. \u2018I thought he had been hit by a car and wandered around the road looking for him,\u2019 he said. Survivor: Pip was saved when his owner found him at 1am in a cage in a bush in Wilson's front garden . It was only when he heard a miaow that he was able to trace Pip to a cage in a bush in Wilson\u2019s front garden. \u2018I turned the light of my mobile phone on and saw he was sitting in this cage,\u2019 Mr Wilcockson said. \u2018I realised it was a trap immediately.\u2019 The cage was made of chicken wire and baited with tuna. As the cat entered, a peg holding up a plastic flap was dislodged, sealing the animal in. Wilson was arrested the next day and questioned. He admitted responsibility and apologised to the family. He was later fined \u00a3250 for theft by Scarborough magistrates and ordered to pay \u00a3205 in compensation. \u2018He said he was very sorry for what he had done and would never have done it if he had known the hurt he was causing,\u2019 Mr Wilcockson, 28, said. \u2018He has a really beautiful garden and the reason he gave police was he likes it pristine and did not want to put his hand in the soil and find cat poo. If we had known there was a problem we would have bought him some cat-repellent pellets to put down \u2013 but we didn\u2019t know. \u2018We still do talk to him though. He is very remorseful. We don\u2019t expect to ever see the other two cats again but if anyone knows anything we would like to know if they are all right.\u2019 Wilson said last night: \u2018It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of.\u2019",

        "article": "By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 10:53 EST, 2 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 2 September 2012 . The daddy of all Formula 1 games is back. And now, thanks to loads of improvements, you\u2019ll be able to feel the passion, speed and glory of the world\u2019s most glamorous sport like never before. Yes, it\u2019s F1 2012, which developers say is the most accessible and immersive F1 game out there. And, as an F1 \u2018noob\u2019, I\u2019d have to agree. Formula fun: Yet again, the F1 game is shaping up to be a classic . This is largely due to the ingenious Young Drivers Test. Here, F1 novices are taught the basics of the sport through tutorials, and learn how to get the best from their cars. This even includes how to use the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) and the DRS (Drag Reduction System). When you\u2019re ready, you can test out your moves in a variety of different game modes. These include Champions mode \u2013 where you\u2019re thrown straight into the action against one of six world champions (Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button, Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumacher) to try and beat them and become the ultimate champion. Then there\u2019s the Season Challenge, where you take part in ten races. You start as a low-ranking team and select a rival driver you think you can beat. As you beat him over a series of races, you will win their seat in the better car \u2013 eventually working your way through the field to become champion. Of course, if you\u2019re still not up to the challenge, F1 2012 features all-new lap walk-throughs from F1 test driver Anthony Davidson. Davidson will talk the player through a lap of each of the 20 circuits on the 2012 calendar, highlighting braking points, gearing and giving expert technical advice which will help players find extra speed on every lap. There have been the usual graphical upgrades, too. One massive improvement is the localised weather system. This results in sudden weather changes in different parts of the track. Breathtaking: The attention to detail really is something to behold . When one part of the track is wet while other areas are dry, the race will become more unpredictable and you\u2019ll have to make game-changing strategy calls. 'The whole weather scenario system has really been refined this year,\u201d said Paul Jeal, Game Director. 'You\u2019ll get weather fronts come in now and then and it could be raining at one section of the track but dry on another. 'You get those moments where you\u2019re not sure which tyres to be on and that really mixes up the racing.' The general look has improved, too. The EGO engine has been tweaked so graphics seem sharper this time around. The attention to detail is fantastic, with dynamic lighting shining off the cars. Handling, however, does take some getting used to \u2013 no matter what difficulty you\u2019re on, is hard to manage. But it\u2019s incredibly rewarding when you get it right, and there are useful speed / break markers which help keep you on course. 'Significant work has gone into the physics model, particularly the suspension, which has a real change on the feel of the car,\u2019 said Stephen Hood, Creative Director. 'You can really attack the track. It\u2019s those extra elements that make you feel like a real F1 driver.\u2019 And for those after authenticity, then look no further. Photorealistic: Squint your eyes and you'll feel that you're watching a race on TV . All twelve teams and twenty-four drivers competing in the 2012 season will feature, and the brand-new, incomplete Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas \u2014 is included in the championship. Drivers, start your engines. It\u2019s due out September 21. Follow Talal on Twitter: @Mooseygamer and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.",

        "article": "Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey handed Arsenal a 2-0 win away in Monaco, but it wasn't enough as Arsene Wenger's side crashed out of the Champions League. French striker Giroud struck in the first half to give travelling Arsenal fans a glimmer of hope at the Stade Louis II before Ramsey grabbed a second. However, a resilient Monaco defence refused to let in another and the French side progressed to the next round on the away goals rule. Sportsmail's Rob Draper was at the game to give the lowdown in France... Arsenal . David Ospina 6 . So little to do, the Colombian effectively took the evening off for much of the game. Hector Bellerin 5.5 . Loves to get forward, can\u2019t be faulted in his running. But still partial to panicky moments in his own penalty area. Monaco's Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho vies with Arsenal's midfielder Francis Coquelin . Per Mertesacker 6 . In control, assured. A different player altogether to the man who fell apart in the first leg. Laurent Koscielny 6.5 . Almost opened the scoring with a prod on to the bat from very close range. Had less to do at the back. Nacho Monreal 5.5 . Pushed on, got forward, but his delivery on the cross lets him down at times and was exposed at times. Francis Coquelin 6.5 . Taking his enforcer role to heart. Twice he crunched Joao Moutinho in half in the first half but avoided a yellow card. Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla attempts a special effort during the UEFA Champions League . Santi Cazorla 6.5 . Adequate but not quite the little magician that you were expecting given that he has been Arsenal\u2019s best player of late. Alexis Sanchez 5.5 . Strangely lackadaisical in his passing which almost let in Monaco in the eighth minute. Booked \u2013 harshly \u2013 for a dive. His energy was impressive as ever. Mesut Ozil 7 . Never stopped trying to create, always looking for the killer pass \u2013 had an extremely organised Monaco midfield with which he had to contend. Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker vies with Monaco's French defender Layvin Kurzawa . Danny Welbeck 7 . A veritable bundle of energy, driving into the Monaco penalty area. His pass set up Giroud\u2019s goal. Came off on 71 minutes as influence faded. Olivier Giroud 7.5 . Really excellent finish to open the scoring. His reaction and poise once the ball bounced off his head was superb. Redemptive after the first game. Subs . Aaron Ramsey (for Coquelin 62) 7 - Fine reaction and finish when Kurzawa inexplicably gave the ball to him on 79 minutes. Walcott (for Welbeck 72) 6 . Gibbs (for Monreal 82) 6 . Monaco defender Wallace vies with  French striker Giroud during the match  at Louis II stadium . Manager . Arsene Wenger 7 . Game plan was assured, defence was solid and they gave themselves the chance. It did beg the question why they couldn\u2019t have done that in the first leg? Monaco . Danijel Subasic 8 . Solid taking crosses and produced good saves, notably from Ozil\u2019s second half free-kick. Unfortunate for Giroud\u2019s goal. Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin vies with Monaco's French forward Anthony Martial during the  match . Fabinho 5 . Struggled to maintain composure at times as Arsenal poured forward. A difficult night. Aymen Abdennour 6.5 . Was the leader at the back, forever cajoling and generally anticipating much of Arsenal\u2019s attacking intent. Wallace 6 . Preferred to the much more experienced Ricardo Carvalho and didn\u2019t let his side down. Layvin Kurzawa 4 . Looked vulnerable, especially when Welbeck switched to the right. Dreadful error giving the ball away for the second goal. Monaco's Bulgarian forward Dimitar Berbatov  vies with Arsenal's French midfielder Coquelin . Geoffrey Kondogbia 7.5 . Fought, tackled and ran. Did as much anyone to secure Monaco\u2019s passage to the quarters. Jeremy Toulalon 7 . Composed, robust, provided leadership, especially in those tricky final few minutes. Nabil Dirar 7.5 . Remained a threat even with Monaco camped in their own half. Terrific speed and desire. Joao Moutinho 6.5 . Not as influential as the first leg but still fulfilled his duties and brought composure when necessary. Giroud celebrates as he gives Arsenal a glimmer of hope against Monaco at the Louis II stadium . Anthony Martial 5 . Strugled to make an impact and taken of on 59 minutes. Dimitar Berbatov 7 . The touches were just as exquisite as always; did what he does and then departed after 76 minutes to make way for younger, fitter men. Subs . Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco (for Martial 59) 7 . Bernado Silva (For Berbatov 76) 6 . Nabil Dirar (for Edelson 85) 6 . Arsenal's Chilean ace Alexis Sanchez vies for the ball with Monaco's French defender Kurzawa . Manager . Leonardo Jardim 7.5 . So they lost 2-0 \u2013 but over two legs Jardim has been masterful. Even last night his team were superbly set up. Ref . Svein Oddvar Moen 6 . Perhaps harsh on booking Alexis Sanchez for diving; otherwise avoided major controversy for the most part and refereed sensibly.",

        "article": "By . Alex Ward . PUBLISHED: . 17:01 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 19 February 2013 . British war graves in India are in danger of being dug up to make way for a new metro rail line. Some of the 2,000 graves in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh state capital, could be destroyed as part of plans by the city\u2019s authorities to build a railway line. The graves are those of British troops who were trapped inside the Lucknow Residency during the uprising of 1857 known as the Indian Mutiny or India's First War of Independence. Plans to dig up: Some of the 2,000 British war graves in Lucknow, India are in danger of being dug up to make way for a new metro rail line in the city . The cemeteries, which are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, have become a site of pilgrimage for descendants of the troops which include some of the most celebrated figures in the British Empire. Buried there are Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, whose statue stands in Trafalgar Square in London, and Major William Hodson, founder of the Hodson\u2019s Horse irregular cavalry which continues today as the Indian Army's 4th Horse Regiment. Not to rest in peace: The cemeteries, protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, have become a site of pilgrimage for descendants of the troops killed during the uprising of 1857 known as the Indian Mutiny . Some descendants, including leading judge Sir Mark Havelock-Allan, have voiced their concern about the construction plans. P.K. Mishral, superintendent of the Lucknow branch of the survey, said the graves were historic shrines that must be protected. He was quoted in the\u00a0Daily Telegraph saying: We have to protect all these things relevant to our history.\u2019 But city officials are angry at the Archeological Survey of India\u2019s rules which protect the graves as historical monuments, preventing any construction within 330 feet of them. They claim that the rules should be waived in this case as the graves are not looked after by relatives and are preventing the modernisation of the city. Waive restrictions: City officials are angry at rules which prevent any construction within 330 feet of the graves claiming that they should be waived as the graves are not looked after by relatives . A Metro project manager, who did not want to be named, said he thought the opposition could be overruled. Celebrated figures: Among those buried there is Major-General Sir Henry Havelock, whose statue stands in Trafalgar Square in London . He said: \u2018There are some difficulties and we are trying to sort them out with concerned officials. \u2018We will take care of everything before taking a final decision.\u2019 The Indian Mutiny was an uprising by local soldiers against the ruling British East India Company. In 1857, growing tension was inflamed by rumours that Indian soldiers' rifle cartridges were being greased with pig and cow fat, offending Muslims and Hindus alike. The unrest erupted in May. The city of Delhi soon fell and there were further uprisings elsewhere. In Lucknow, Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence fortified his home - the Residency - and prepared for a siege. Mutineers attacked the Residency and its 1,700-strong garrison in May and by July Sir Henry was dead. Garrison numbers dwindled until a relief force under Major-General Sir Henry Havelock fought its way into Lucknow in September. The Residency was evacuated in November but was recaptured in March the following year and the uprising was crushed soon after. The East India Company was subsequently abolished and the government of India transferred to the Crown.",

        "article": "Noah Galloway's daily workouts could intimidate the most seasoned athlete. He runs, climbs, does pull-ups and push-ups, and lifts weights for nearly two hours at a time. But what really sets this 30-year-old father of three apart is that he does it all with one arm and one leg. In the aftermath of September 11, Galloway felt called to serve his country. At 19, he withdrew from the University of Alabama at Birmingham and enlisted in the United States Army. \"After we were attacked, I felt like it was what I needed to do. I quit school and started off on a new journey.\" Galloway was deployed to Iraq with the 101st Airborne out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in 2003. After becoming a husband and father, he returned for a second tour in 2005. \"They put us in an area that was known as the triangle of death. It was southwest of Baghdad. The units that had been there before us had taken a beating. It was just a rough area.\" Four months into his second deployment, he was trying to catch a bit of sleep between missions when his platoon leader woke him. \"He said, 'Hey, we're gonna go take these Humvees to go pick up the rest of the platoon.' Said there's nothing important going on.  We're just going to pick them up, coming back. Just wanted you to know we're leaving.\" But Galloway says he insisted on not only joining the convoy but driving the lead vehicle, a decision that put him in the path of a roadside bomb detonated by a trip wire. Four days later, on Christmas morning, Galloway woke in Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. \"I had no idea where I was or how I got there. I remember waking up and seeing my parents walking in. I knew I was somewhere safe because they were there, and something told me to smile because they'd know I was OK.\" He lost his left arm above the elbow and left leg above the knee. His jaw needed to be reconstructed, and his mouth was wired shut. His recovery was as rough emotionally as it was physically, and during it he and his wife divorced. \"I remember thinking it was all over. I was very physical. I'd lost two limbs, a wife. You know, I remember thinking I much rather had died than wake up like this,\" Galloway said. His attitude started to shift thanks, in part, to a fellow amputee: his father, who lost his hand at age 18 when a machine malfunction at the plant where he worked. \"I remember there was a moment that my mom leaned in and told me while I laid in the hospital bed, and she said, 'You just had to outdo your dad and lose your arm and your leg,' and it was that moment that I thought, 'you know, this is bad, but it could be worse. Maybe I can do something with this.' \" Galloway moved back home to Alabama, remarried and had two more children. He then decided it was time he got back into shape. He found Combat Fitness Training Facility in Birmingham. The gym is owned by Army veteran who designs military-inspired workouts that Galloway thrives on. \"He's shown great drive, and basically the goals that he sets, every time he achieves one, he sets a higher one,\" Combat Fitness owner Sean Dickson said. Galloway continues to push himself harder and now competes in grueling races like the Warrior Dash and Tough Mudder, in which runners tackle an obstacle course. He is also training to run the Marine Corps Marathon in October. He has documented his journey through social media and garnered a legion of supporters with his story. \"People started following me in what I was doing, sending me messages and telling me how I motivated them. Some were people with disabilities. Some were not,\" Galloway said. \"I never intended that to happen. I was just doing something for myself.\" Seeing his recovery as an opportunity to motivate others, he joined Team X-T.R.E.M.E. The nonprofit enlists people to participate in physically demanding races wearing gas masks. The proceeds are used to take injured veterans on morale-boosting trips. \"It's not that I'm this incredible guy, but my injury was before them. And if I can show them the route I took to success, then they can follow the same, and that makes me feel good.\" Galloway is passionate about leading other veterans to recovery and showing them what they can do instead of what they can't, but the most important people he hopes to inspire are much closer to home. \"I'm showing my two sons and my daughter that no matter what happens to you in life, you can continue pushing. You can continue to be happy and do whatever you want to do. I feel like I'm showing them what they need to do, because as a parent, you can try to preach to your children all day long. They don't hear your words. They only see your actions. And I hope that I'm showing them a healthy, happy way of leading their life.\"",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG is not backing down from its charge that Michael Jackson's mother and her lawyers leaked e-mails to a reporter, in violation of a court order, despite a claim of responsibility by someone not connected to the Jackson's wrongful-death lawsuit against the concert promoter. The dramatic e-mails, published in the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, revealed the promoter for Jackson's \"This Is It\" concerts expressed doubts about the star's health and his ability to be ready for the shows for several months before his death. Howard Mann, who partnered with Katherine Jackson on a book about her family, acknowledged to CNN Wednesday that he gave the controversial documents to Times reporter Harriet Ryan. Mann said he obtained the documents from various sources, but none of them came from the Jacksons or their lawyers. Some of the documents were part of discovery in other cases, including the criminal trial of Dr. Conrad Murray, he said. \"The Times does not comment on sources,\" Ryan said in response to CNN's request for comment on Mann's claim that he gave them to her. Mann was involved in a bitter copyright dispute concerning that book with Jackson's estate at the time he gave the reporter the documents, but the lawsuit was settled earlier this week. E-mails show promoter's doubts before Jackson's death . AEG lawyer Marvin Putnam, who said Tuesday that he had \"unequivocal evidence\" showing that MIchael Jackson's mother and her lawyers leaked the e-mails, has asked the judge in the wrongful-death suit to punish Jackson with fines and exclude the e-mails as evidence in the case. \"The documents released to the press were given to Mrs. Jackson and her attorneys -- and to no one else -- confidentially in discovery and subject to a court order,\" Putnam said Tuesday. On Thursday, he called it \"convenient that Howard Mann -- a longtime business partner of the Jackson family -- has come forward in this fashion.\" \"Whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by Mrs. Jackson and her counsel, this remains an egregious violation of the court's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation,\" the AEG lawyer said. Putnam accused Jackson and her lawyers of leaking the documents -- despite that their \"publication hurts her son's memory and her grandchildren more than anyone else\" -- because they \"know they cannot win on the law and are losing control over the case.\" \"After months of discovery, plaintiffs now know what we have known all along -- there is nothing to support their claims,\" the AEG lawyer said. Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle said the admission by Mann that he was the source of the e-mails should settle the matter. \"He (Mann) definitely never received any documents from Katherine, Prince, Paris, or Blanket Jackson, nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against AEG,\" said Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle. Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are Michael Jackson's children. Boyle criticized AEG's lawyers for their haste in pointing the finger at the Jacksons. \"AEG made these accusations against the Jackson family and their lawyers apparently without doing even the most rudimentary investigation,\" Boyle said. \"We are further disturbed that the motion for sanctions filed by AEG was given to the press before it was served on Katherine Jackson or her counsel.\" If the AEG lawyers had reached out to the Jackson lawyers earlier, they could have helped solve the mystery of the leaked documents, he said. \"AEG has known about the alleged leak since a week before the article was published,\" Boyle said. \"AEG never contacted the Jackson's counsel to inquire about the article or the documents.\" The documents made public in the Times story are not the most damaging to AEG that were uncovered, Boyle said. \"We can assure you that we are in possession of documents that make for an extremely compelling story in the wrongful-death case, and that completely support the plaintiffs' claims,\" he said. Jackson copyright dispute settled . CNN has learned from a lawyer for an insurance company embroiled in a lawsuit with AEG that Mann approached him several weeks ago offering the same documents to help their case against the promoter. The company declined to follow up since they did not know their authenticity, attorney Paul Schrieffer said. Mann alerted the lawyer Saturday that the e-mails would be published in the newspaper Sunday, Schrieffer said. \"The first time we saw these documents was in the Los Angeles Times article.\" The existence of the e-mails, which were not turned over to the insurance company during the discovery phase of the case, have complicated AEG's effort to prevent a court from voiding the $17.5 million policy that AEG purchased through Lloyds of London, he said. \"We are looking for information about Michael Jackson's prior drug use and the failure of AEG to disclose the facts and what the truth was prior to our client's issuance of the policy,\" Schrieffer said. The AEG lawyer said the insurance company can expect to get the e-mails eventually. \"It appears the lawyers for the insurance company did what any ethical lawyer would do: they refused to receive documents leaked in violation of the Court's order. And I have every reason to believe the insurers will now receive those same documents as discovery continues,\" Putnam said. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, from what the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives, drugs that Dr. Conrad Murray told police he used to help the entertainer sleep as he prepared for the concerts set to start two weeks later. The insurer contends AEG hid Jackson's health problems and failed to respond to repeated requests for his medical history when applying for insurance for the 50 shows scheduled for London's O2 Arena. The wrongful-death suit, filed by Katherine Jackson and her son's three children, contends that AEG contributed to the pop star's death by pressuring him to prepare even though the promoters knew he was in a weak condition and by its hiring and supervision of Dr. Murray. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison last year. \"Defendants did not hire Dr. Murray nor were they responsible for the death of Michael Jackson,\" AEG lawyer Putnam told CNN Tuesday. Randy Phillips, the president of AEG Live -- the concert-promotion branch of AEG -- called Jackson's death \"a terrible tragedy\" in one e-mail written weeks after he died, adding \"but life must go on.\" \"AEG will make a fortune from merch sales, ticket retention, the touring exhibition and the film/dvd,\" Phillips wrote. In fact, AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary \"This Is It,\" produced from rehearsal video. The e-mails suggest AEG Live's president saw Jackson's problems first-hand the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. \"MJ is locked in his room drunk and despondent,\" Phillips wrote in a March 5, 2009, e-mail to AEG Live's parent company, the paper reported. \"I (am) trying to sober him up.\" \"I screamed at him so loud the walls are shaking,\" Phillips wrote. \"He is an emotionally paralyzed mess riddled with self-loathing and doubt now that it is show time.\" The promoter blamed London traffic when Jackson was 90 minutes late for the announcement that day. \"He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,\" Phillips told CNN two months later to refute reports Jackson's health was threatening the concerts. The Los Angeles Times story, however, said the e-mails indicated major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. \"We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants,\" AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware e-mailed to Phillips. Jackson's missed rehearsals in June triggered concerns in e-mails that he was slow in learning his dance routines and would have to lip-sync on stage, the newspaper reported. \"MJ is not in shape enough yet to sing this stuff live and dance at the same time,\" one e-mail from the show's music director read, the paper reported. A production manager wrote: \"He was a basket case. Doubt is pervasive.\" A loud warning from show director Kenny Ortega, who worked closely with Jackson on previous tours, came in mid-June, just over a week before his death. Ortega wrote to Phillips that Jackson had \"strong signs of paranoia, anxiety and obsessive-like behavior\" and suggesting they bring a \"top psychiatrist in to evaluate him ASAP.\" \"It is like there are two people there. One (deep inside) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not wanting us to quit him, the other in this weakened and troubled state,\" Ortega wrote. \"I believe we need professional guidance in this matter.\" Ortega testified at Murray's trial about his concerns about Jackson's frail condition and missed rehearsals. It resulted in a meeting six days before Jackson's death in which Murray assured the promoters he would have Jackson ready for rehearsals that next week. An e-mail from Phillips after that meeting said he had confidence in Murray \"who I am gaining immense respect for as I get to deal with him more.\" \"This doctor is extremely successful (we check everyone out) and does not need this gig, so he (is) totally unbiased and ethical,\" Phillips' e-mail said.",

        "article": "By . Sarah Griffiths . Jason Manford (pictured) is worried he may have testicular cancer, after finding a lump . Comedian Jason Manford has revealed he has been struck by a cancer scare, fearing a lump he found on his 'favourite testicle' could be the disease. The stand-up discovered an abnormality on his left testicle and told his Facebook followers that he has booked an urgent doctor\u2019s appointment to get it checked out. The 33-year-old showed his sense of humour, telling his fans he found the 'little lump on my favourite testicle'. Updating fans yesterday evening, the comedian from Salford wrote: \u2018[I\u2019ve] booked in a doctor\u2019s appointment tomorrow for a check, I'm sure it's nowt but it's good to talk about these things.\u2019 In another update this morning, before heading to his daughters\u2019 sports day, the father-of-three said: \u2018I can't help thinking the papers have slightly overreacted to my Facebook post but if I guess if it makes another bloke get himself checked then it's worth it!\u2019 He is currently finishing the final dates of a long UK tour. Mr Manford . wrote on Facebook yesterday: \u2018My body \"hey brain, has Jason got much work in this . week after his 220-date, 6 nights a week tour?\" \u2018My body \"oh good\" My brain \"why do you ask?\" \u2018My body \"oh, I'm just thinking of f*****g him right up with a bit of the flu, a frozen shoulder, back ache and a swollen ankle...oh and schedule an appointment in at the doctors cause I've just developed a lump on his left testicle so he can spend the rest of his break either ill or worried.\u201d \u2018Cheers body!\u2019 Sharing his scare on Facebook with more than 800,000 followers, the comedian, who has presented TV shows including 8 out of 10 cats and A Question of Sport, said: 'Super Saturday, encouraged other men to check out any worrying lumps, before posting a link to the NHS\u2019 cancer prevention page.' Mr Manford met bowel cancer sufferer Stephen Sutton and helped him raise money for The Teenage Cancer Trust, before Stephen tragically died in May. He rallied celebrities to join a Thumbs up for Stephen campaign on Twitter, which helped the teenager raise over \u00a33million before he died. The total is currently at around \u00a34.1million. On his Facebook page, he wrote: \u2018Let's start a #thumbsupforStephen. He gave us one, let's give him one back, and donated \u00a310,000 to the cause. The stand-up comedian yesterday told his Facebook followers (pictured) that he has booked an urgent doctor's appointment to get a lump on his left testicle checked out . Last night, Mr Manford, managed to find humour in the scary situation by writing that he has found 'a little lump on my favourite testacle' and this morning posted that he was surprised he has received so much attention . Testicular cancer usually affects men between the ages of 15 and 44. Men are advised to visit a doctor as soon as possible if they notice any lump or swelling on their testicles. Symptoms include: . Less than four per cent of testicular lumps are cancerous and swollen blood vessels are a common cause of them. Testicular cancer is one of the less common forms of cancer, accounting for one per cent of all cancers that occur in men. Each year, just over 2,000 men are diagnosed with it, according to Cancer Research UK. Testicular cancer is one of the most treatable types of cancer. Over 95 per cent of men with early stage testicular cancer can be completely cured, and even cases where the cancer has spread to nearby tissue, have an 80 per cent chance of being cured.",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:30 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:32 EST, 17 September 2012 . A woman has narrowly escaped death after contracting the plague from a stray cat that she had tried to help while it was choking. The woman, who has asked not to be identified, was attacked at the same time as her family friend, Paul Gaylord, when they found the distressed animal choking on a rodent in Oregon in June. When they tried to help the cat, it bit them - and four days later the woman started showing symptoms of the infection that killed millions in the Middle Ages. Disease-stricken: A woman caught the plague after trying to help a cat that was choking on a rodent (file picture) Gaylord, 60, hit national headlines after he had to spend a life on month support due to the illness. His fingers and toes were left blackened by the bacteria, and he needed to have them amputated. But after the woman began showing symptoms, including fever, chills and pain in her lymph nodes, she was treated with antibiotics at a Portland hospital. Thanks to this early detection, she survived. 'We got to her just in time,' said Karen Yeargain of the Crook County Health Department. 'If this hadn't happened, we would have had another critically ill person on our hands.' While doctors suspected the woman had the bacterial illness, results from the Centers for Disease Control have now confirmed it, Yeargain said. Deadly: She was bitten by a cat at the same time as Paul Gaylord, pictured, who lost his fingers and toes to the 'black death'. The woman detected the symptoms earlier and has made a full recovery . Terrible symptoms: The disease, pictured ravaging Gaylord's hands in July, killed millions in the Middle Ages and affects about seven people a year in the United States . Plague is spread through the bite of . infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or . person. The disease is now extremely rare, with about seven cases a year . in the U.S. The woman was bitten at the same time as Gaylord, 60, by the stray cat he had adopted. It is thought that the rat was infected by fleas, which carry the disease. After antibiotics failed to make him feel better, he was rushed to hospital when his lymph nodes swelled to the size of lemons. In July, he underwent surgery to remove his withered, blackened fingers and toes - one of the symptoms of the terrible disease that gave it the name, the 'black death'. Survivor: Seven-year-old Sierra Jane Downing from Colorado, pictured with her parents, also contracted the disease earlier this month from a dead squirrel on a camping trip. She has made a full recovery . Research suggests that the bubonic plague, which used to be associated with squalor, is on the increase in affluent communities in the U.S. As more people move to natural environments where ground squirrels and woodrats live, infection increases. The disease is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis that is spread through flea bites. Symptoms usually appear between two and five days after exposure to the bacteria. They include gangrene . of the extremities such as toes, fingers, lips and tip of the nose; . fever; muscle cramps; seizures; lymph gland swelling. Other potential symptoms include . heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood, aching limbs and extreme . pain, usually caused by the decay of the skin while the person is still . alive. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days . About 11 cases of plague a year have occured in the U.S. since 1976. 'They tell me I'm doing really good . considering,' he told OregonLive.com from his hospital bed in Bend, . Oregon in July. 'I do feel lucky. I'm going to have a long row to hoe . but at least I have one.' His mother, Almeda, 81, explained how close her son came to death. 'His heart stopped. His lung collapsed. They told us he wasn't going to make it,' she said. Gaylord spent nearly a month on life support and it was so touch-and-go at one point that his son, Jake, flew in from Austin, Texas, to say goodbye. 'I was delirious,' said Mr Gaylor of his memory of the month he spent in intensive care. 'Things didn't seem real. The clock ran backwards.' Although the plague is generally connected to the Middle Ages, the woman is the 18th person sickened by the disease in Oregon since 1934. A seven-year-old girl, Sierra Jane Downing, also contracted the disease while on a camping trip in Colorado this month. It is believed she caught it from a dead squirrel, who she had asked her parents if she could bury. They said no, but she knelt beside it and doctors believe fleas could have jumped on to her sweater. Historic illness: A picture of 1721 shows victims of the plague, which is transferred through the bite of infected fleas or through direct contact with an infected animal or person . Days after they returned from the . trip, her parents found her in the bathroom having a seizure. She was . rushed to hospital and treated with antibiotics once doctors realised . what it was. She will make a full recovery and has been released from hospital. Without treatment the plague kills around two thirds of infected humans within four days. It causes an infection that kills cells, causing gangrene which also often results in amputation. Symptoms of the plague in humans, which typically appear within four days, include fever, chills and a bloody or watery cough. In animals, it presents itself with enlarged lymph nodes under the jaw, as well as fever and tiredness.",

        "article": "Even while recovering from the removal of a cyst from his foot last month, Kei Nishikori was so desperate to be on a tennis court that his joint coach, Dante Bottini, had to improvise. \u2018He was sitting on a collapsible chair on the court because he couldn\u2019t run and I was feeding him balls to hit for an hour,\u2019 recalled Bottini after his charge had beaten Novak Djokovic to make tonight\u2019s US Open final. Such dedication is why 24-year-old Japanese Nishikori is poised to become a superstar of Asian sport, and why he has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of Special Kei. Something special: Kei Nishikori, 24,\u00a0has long gone by the not entirely original nickname of Special Kei . Preparation: Nishikori, the Japanese No 10 seed, practices in New York ahead of the US Open final . Ten years after arriving as a homesick boy at the renowned Nick Bollettieri/IMG Academy in Florida, he is in his first Grand Slam final and will start as favourite against the comparatively towering Marin Cilic. It is the first Grand Slam men\u2019s final in nearly nine years not to feature one of the so-called \u2018Big Four\u2019 of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. But neither of the two surprise finalists would have been top of the list to depose the established order. Cilic, 25, has spent most of his career on the periphery of the top 10, while the fear around Nishikori, the son of an engineer and a piano teacher, is that he is not physically equipped to make the very top. At 5ft 10in and weighing less than 11 stone his body has often failed to cope with the physical aspect of the modern game, although his natural talent has never been in question. He has always possessed an outstanding backhand and won his first ATP Tour title at Delray Beach as an 18-year-old. Subsequently the questions have not just surrounded his physique but his mentality, particularly when it came to facing the best players. Over the past week he has answered all of that with consecutive five-set wins over Milos Raonic and Stan Wawrinka, followed by Saturday\u2019s semi-final against Djokovic, who he outlasted over four sets in brutal heat and humidity. Coming of age: Nishikori's beaten Milos Raonic, Stan Wawrinka and Novak Djokovic en route to the final . Brad Gilbert, who formed part of his coaching set-up in 2011, describes him as \u2018very quiet and shy\u2019. His faltering mastery of English may have been a part of that, and Gilbert would email him tactical instructions for matches, rather than talk to him. The missing ingredient appears to have been the addition of French Open winner Michael Chang to his team, part of the trend set by Murray when he hired Ivan Lendl. Like Lendl, Chang has managed to get through to his charge in a way that did not happen before. \u2018We get on great,\u2019 said Chang. \u2018With myself being Chinese and Kei Japanese there are cultural differences but also similarities because we are both Asian. If we are going out to eat we don\u2019t have to say \u201cDo you want Asian food?\u201d It has been easy for us to adapt to one another.\u2019 Nishikori missed several tournaments last month due to the cyst, but Chang believes that this has proved to be a blessing in disguise. \u2018It wasn\u2019t the best preparation but after three weeks off he arrived fresh and hungry. Some guys have a great summer but by the time the Open comes around they are tired. Support network: Nishikori has shone since Michael Chang took over as his coach . \u2018I told him if he could get past the first two rounds anything could happen. I keep reminding him he has beaten everyone here, and not to be satisfied with what he has achieved already.\u2019 Chang was a terrific fighter with lightning foot speed. Nishikori is also quick but his natural timing gives him more potent weapons than his coach ever had, despite his relative lack of size. It has led him to become easily the best player ever from Japan, which has always produced good female players but struggled much more on the men\u2019s side. Their previous best of the modern era was Shuzo Matsuoka in the nineties, who is perhaps best remembered for suffering a spectacular bout of cramp that led to the rules being changed about on-court treatment. Nishikori would become the first Japanese man to win a tennis Major, and the commercial possibilities of that would be almost limitless. Either way, tennis is going to get its least predictable men\u2019s Grand Slam champion since Juan Martin del Potro upset Federer at Flushing Meadows five years ago. Federer was phlegmatic after his straight-sets defeat by the hugely impressive Cilic, but this was a golden opportunity missed for him to add to his 17 Grand Slams. Nishikori has a 5-2 record over Cilic and has beaten him twice this year. Yet the Croatian has improved significantly and is an outstanding mover for his height, meaning that the Japanese can only be considered a marginal favourite. No pressure: Although towering over his opponent, Marin Cilic goes into the final as the underdog . Giant: 6ft 6in Cilic beat Roger Federer in straight sets to win his place in the final .

        "article": "By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 10:04 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:06 EST, 3 October 2012 . Pope Benedict's former butler stole thousands of highly sensitive documents the pontiff had marked 'to be destroyed' and compromised Vatican security through his actions, a court heard today. On the third day of Paolo Gabriele's trial, testimony depicted a man fascinated by the occult, Masonic lodges, secret services and past Italian and Vatican scandals. Stefano De Santis was one of four Vatican police officers who said they found the papers in the 46-year-old's home. On trial: The Pope's former butler Paolo Gabriele (right) sits in the wood-trimmed courtroom of the Vatican tribunal at an earlier hearing on Saturday. He is accused of stealing thousands of top secret papal documents . He told the Vatican courtroom: 'You can understand our unease when we saw these documents. This was a total violation of the privacy of the papal family.' Gabriele's leak to an Italian journalist of sensitive documents, some of them alleging corruption in the Vatican, caused one of the biggest crises of Pope Benedict's papacy. It threw an unflattering spotlight on the inner workings of a city-state eager to shake off a series of scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by clerics around the world and mismanagement at its bank. Gabriele, a trusted servant who served the pope meals, helped him dress and rode in the popemobile, has admitted passing papers to the journalist at secret meetings, but told the court at a previous hearing he did not see this as a crime. The former butler sat impassively and occasionally smiled during Wednesday's 75-minute session as Vatican policemen told the court how they searched his apartment in the Vatican on May 23, the night of his arrest, and what they found. The mass of incriminating documents, most of which were hidden in huge piles of papers stashed in a large wardrobe, included personal letters between the pope, cardinals and politicians on a variety of subjects. Close: Pope Benedict XVI and Gabiele (bottom left) with the pontiff's private secretary Georg Gaenswein in May . Some papers, De Santis said, bore the . pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff . in German. He did not say what those papers concerned. Some of the documents were copies of encrypted documents. De Santis told the court: 'One photocopy was enough to threaten the operations of the Holy See.' The agents said they found a mass of documents and books filled with newspaper clippings on the occult, secret services, Masonic lodges, yoga, political scandals in Italy, scandals involving the Vatican bank and other subjects. Defence lawyer Cristiana Arru sought to turn the spotlight on police methods during the search, drawing out several agents to say that they had not used gloves when they handled the documents, and a gold nugget and a cheque for 100,000 euros made out to the pope which were also found. Police said Gabriele, once one of fewer than ten people who had the key to an elevator leading to the private papal apartment, had printed instructions on how to hide files in computers and how to use mobile phones secretly. Police told the hearing that some of the papers bore the Pope's handwriting and had been marked 'to be destroyed' by the pontiff in German . Bishop Francesco Cavina, who knew Gabriele in the Vatican, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica on Wednesday that the butler, a father-of-three, may have a 'disturbed mind' and 'a split personality'. Two of the four policemen who testified on Wednesday also rejected Gabriele's accusations, made on Tuesday, that he was mistreated for several weeks after his arrest. Gabriele told the court's previous hearing that for up to 20 days he was held in a room so small he could not stretch out his arms and that the light was left on 24 hours a day, causing him eye damage.A Vatican judge ordered an investigation into the allegations. De Santis said the search turned up 'many more' papers than appeared in a book by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote a muckraking expose early in 2012. The letters to the pope included one in which a senior Vatican functionary expressed concern about corruption in the Holy See's business dealings with Italian companies. The letter-writer, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, was posted to Washington after raising the issue, despite begging to be allowed to stay at the papal state. The trial adjourned until Saturday, when a verdict is expected.",

        "article": "By . Suzannah Hills . and Leon Watson . Preacher: The guide was written by Samir Khan who was killed by U.S. airstrikes in Yemen . A bizarre 'must-read' English language manual for Westerners wanting to become a terrorist has been published by Al Qaeda, it emerged today. The glossy 16-page guide includes rules that recruits must follow as well as recommendations on how to cope with the hardships and dangers of life as a jihad. It includes everyday advice on taking showers, camping and how to avoid difficult questions - but also suggests new recruits target the U.S.. The guide was written by Samir Khan, an American who served as the top propagandist for the Yemen-based branch of Al Qaeda, who was killed by US Hellfire missiles during a drone attack. He died in September 2011, along with the U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al Awlak. It starts by saying: 'For those Muslims coming from the West, this is a must read document as it includes an invaluable information which will enable them to appropriately understand the importance of their role in the scale of this battle and provide them with a visibility to aptly choose their next step.' The first section of the guide is titled 'cleanliness' and states: 'In some cases, you will be staying with a few brothers in a tight room or house. 'In order to avoid unnecessary problems, encourage yourself and your brothers to clean the room(s) on a regular basis. As for yourself, a daily shower is ideal but not possible in many cases.' Khan then goes on to offer advice on how to cope with the life of a jihad. He says: 'If you feel terrified close your eyes and imagine yourself inside paradise. Think of your hoor [virgins] that are awaiting you as well as meeting the prophets.' Another section urges Western recruits to stay on their home 'sand, rocks or grass' and attack 'America in its own backyard'. The guide continues: 'The effect is much greater, it always embarrasses the enemy, and these types of individual decision-making attacks are nearly impossible for them to contain.' Bizarre: The front page of the jihad manual Expectations Full written by Samir Khan . The guide includes a section on bringing your family to jihad training with terrorists . Khan states: 'In al-qa\u2019idah, we don\u2019t care about the size of your muscles, how fast you run, how strong your legs are and so on - although these things will be strengthened - but we put a special focus on \"lasting long\" and outdoing the enemy in patience. 'In short, prepare for the worse, and hope in the best.' The manual, which also praises cleanliness, says secrecy is one of the pillars of modern day jihad, advising recruits not to reveal their place of birth to other jihadists and to refrain from asking them too many questions. The guide also urges 'brothers' to attack America. Pictured here is the Brooklyn Bridge in New York . On involving family members in acts of terrorism, it says: 'If you have a family that you want to bring to jihad, it may or may not be possible depending on the logistics of the mujahideen. 'In Yemen for example, it's extremely difficult to bring your wife and kids to live amongst the mujahideen. In other lands, this may not be a problem. 'So if you know that the land you are going to is tight on this, then what you can do is bring your family to the land, but keep them in a city where they will be safe and protected by friends. Samir Khan was a top figure in Al Qaeda in Yemen, where soldiers pictured above are still regularly fighting Al Qaeda-linked militants in the southern province of Abyan . Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, pictured in Afghanistan . 'You don't want to risk them being captured by the murtadeen and witnessing them getting raped and tortured in order to extract information about you.' The manual also gives a quick guide to camping: 'Living outdoors will be the most difficult of bases to stay in. In some bases, it won't be too bad since the mujahideen will erect tents and there might be some basic comforts. 'It is possible though that there will be incidents were none of this will be available and you will have to sleep on sand, rocks or grass. They may or may not have blankets and sleeping bags available. 'As for the weather, you should do some research into the country before arriving as to what it\u2019s like during the day and night, especially in deserts, mountainous regions and forests. 'You will want to wear your boots/sneakers/sandals most of the time in the outdoors, but you should get used to taking it off everyday or at least every 3 days to avoid running into foot problems. 'A brother in Afghanistan sticked to taking his boots off every 3 days but didn\u2019t do a good job of washing his feet thoroughly; after some time, he developed a strange foot disease where his small toe was pushed underneath his foot. 'After that, he could no longer walk. Take good care of your feet and wash them properly.'",

A family doctor and father-of-three was jailed today for seriously injuring two people while over the drink-drive limit. Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, from Abergavenny,\u00a0drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row. Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487. The doctor cried in the dock as he admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving. He was banned from driving for four years. The court heard how Roberts paid a visit to his sick mother in Criccieth on June 17, which ended in a row. Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving \u2013 drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487. The journey home was a 120-mile trip that would have taken an able driver around three hours. The crash happened\u00a0between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car driven by Indian restaurant workers\u00a0Babel Mia and passenger Raj Mia. Both cars were written off in the collision and Babel Mia suffered a broken right foot, deep cuts to the head and knees. He was in hospital two days. His colleague suffered broken ribs, cuts and bruises. Roberts, a father of three, suffered a fractured sternum. Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180 miligrammes of alcohol in his blood compared to the legal limit of 80. The crash happened between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd (pictured) Father-of-three Roberts - who was previously disqualified from driving for 27 months in 2010 for drink driving \u2013 drove on the wrong side of the road as he motored along the A487 between\u00a0in Gwynedd, north-west Wales . Anna Pope, defending, said Roberts was receiving treatment for his alcohol addicition and Wynford Ellis Owen had written the report on his treatment. He had gone to Criccieth to visit his ageing mother who was seriously ill with bowel cancer. But there were emotional and mental issues from his childhood which came to the surface and they triggered his decision to drive home. Miss Pope said: 'He takes responsibility for what he did and made frank admissions. 'It is clear from the references there is another side to this man. He is an extremely successful GP valued by his patients. 'He is a loving husband and father to three children. He is also an extremely troubled man throughout his adult life,' she said. The issues from his childhood had driven him to drink and prescription drugs, although there was no suggestion that had affected his work. Miss Pope said his first drink drive offence happened when he had driven to the Black Mountains to commit suicide but could not go through with it. He was arrested as he drove back and was found to be over the limit. He had been detained for a short while under the Mental Health Act and had referred himself for residential rehabilitation. He was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and Miss Pope said he should be spared jail to allow his rehabilitation to continue. The journey the doctor wanted to take was a 120-mile trip that would have taken around three hours . But\u00a0Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive 130 miles plus along 'tortuous roads' was 'extraordinarily dangerous'. He pointed out that he must have known full-well what he was doing was illegal. 'You were placing other road users at risk and sadly that is what happened. You were driving at speed, on the wrong side of the road and around bends, prompting one motorist to film it and another motorist described your overtaking as the most dangerous she had seen. You could easily have killed those in the other car. 'I have read letters from professional colleagues and patients you have assisted over the years. Professionally you are highly thought of and you have taken steps to try and address your drinking. You are the sole provider for a young family and the effect has been profound on them.' He sentenced Roberts to 27 months in jail and disqualified him from driving for four years. The General Medical Council will consider the future of Dr Gwyn Haydn Roberts in January, but Mold Crown Court was told he was unlikely to practise medicine again.",

David Crystal, professor of linguistics of Bangor University, explained how people are dropping letters when typing words into search engines . Common misspellings of English words could be acceptable within a few years because they are used online, a linguist has said. \u2018Rhubarb\u2019 could change to \u2018rubarb\u2019, \u2018receipt\u2019 to \u2018receit\u2019 and \u2018necessary\u2019 to \u2018neccesary\u2019. Simpler online forms of \u2018irritating\u2019 complex words are starting to affect mainstream usage,\u00a0 linguistics professor David Crystal told the Hay Literary Festival. He started monitoring the word \u2018rhubarb\u2019 ten years ago by typing the correct spelling into a search engine, then the error \u2018rubarb\u2019. He said: \u2018I got millions of hits for rhubarb with the \u201ch\u201d, and just one or two without it.\u2019 A few years later, \u2018rubarb\u2019 got \u2018hundreds of hits, and then a\u00a0 few years later hundreds of\u00a0 thousands of hits,\u2019 he said. \u2018Rhubarb is still the dominant one by a factor of 50. But think ahead 50 years .\u2009.\u2009. and rhubarb and rubarb will be equal.\u2019 Professor Crystal, of Bangor University, said the \u2018h\u2019 is illogical and was not used in Middle English. He predicted more changes, saying: \u2018Is it one \u201cc\u201d and two \u201cs\u201ds in necessary or two \u201cc\u201ds and\u00a0 one \u201cs\u201d? .\u2009.\u2009. Over time one\u00a0 spelling will emerge, probably a simpler one. \u2018The internet will influence spelling. It will get rid of some letters that irritate us, the letters that instinctively we feel shouldn\u2019t be there. But it will take time.\u2019 At the festival, Simon Horobin, a professor of English at Oxford, proposed spellings of \u2018they\u2019re\u2019, \u2018their\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019 be standardised and told \u2018grammar police\u2019 to relax over apostrophe usage. Professor Crystal also criticised Education Secretary Michael Gove and plans to make schools concentrate on teaching the phonics. He said the move was 'absurd' because the English language was a mix of phonics and words. A recent study from Cambridge University which was published last month revealed how language is becoming more informal. A recent study from Cambridge University revealed how language is becoming more informal . The average English child is likely . to say the word 'like' five times as often as his or her grandparents . and the word 'love' is used more than six times as often as 'hate'.

Corpus contains written and spoken English from books, newspapers, . advertising, letters, emails, websites, and recordings of conversations, . lectures, TV, meetings, radio and many other sources, totalling several . billion words. Over 20 years, researchers have formed a database which shows there is a decline in the correct use of grammar.

        "article": "Boko Haram fighters late Thursday took over at least three towns in northeast Nigeria, including Chibok, the scene of the April kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls by the militant group, residents and a lawmaker said Friday. \"Boko Haram has taken over Chibok and we have all fled,\" said Enoch Mark, a Christian priest in the town whose daughter and niece are among the kidnapped girls. \"They are now in control of the town, having overpowered the soldiers and the vigilantes.\" The militant Islamist group also raided the towns of Hong and Gombi in Adamawa state, 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) from Yola, the state capital. Local hunters and vigilantes had pushed them out of Mubi, which lies near Nigeria's border with Cameroon and is the commercial hub of the state. Boko Haram seized Mubi two weeks ago and renamed the town \"Madinatul Islam\" (\"City of Islam\" in Arabic). The militants began administering strict Sharia punishments, including public floggings and amputations. With the invasion of the towns, the militants inched closer to Yola, where thousands of residents from areas seized by Boko Haram are taking refuge. \"Boko Haram are all over the town firing heavy guns as they patrol the streets,\" said Gombi resident Dahiru Sahabi. \"They have burned down the police station, the local government secretariat and the market\u200e after overpowering the police.\" Residents moved indoors or fled into the bush to escape the insurgents, said resident Rabi Tanimu\u200e. \"We are all indoors and all we hear is sounds of heavy guns and explosives,\" she said. In Chibok, the town's vigilantes, who help provide security, were quickly overwhelmed by the firepower of the militants. One resident described Chibok as \"a ghost town\" as most residents fled the violence. The insurgents had earlier raided the town of Hong, where they burned down a police station and hoisted their black flag outside the home of a retired military general, said fleeing residents. Before attacking Hong, the \u200emilitants, riding in vans and on motorcycles, sacked a military checkpoint at nearby Marabar P\u200eella village, where they converged after their ouster from Mubi and Maiha, said Hong resident Luka Buba. Chibado Bobi, chief of staff in the Adamawa governor's office\u200e, confirmed that vigilantes and hunters had recaptured Mubi. \"The state government enlisted the help of the vigilantes and hunters to combat Boko Haram and it is paying off,\" Bobi said.\u200e . A resident of Mubi said Boko Haram militants fled the town in droves after the arrival of some 200 vigilantes and hunters, who were armed with homemade guns, spears, clubs, bows and arrows and machetes. The resident, who asked not to be named for personal safety, said hunters captured the ousted occupiers' leader \"outside the military barracks, which the militants (had) converted into their base.\" Vigilantes reportedly reclaimed another town, Maiha, from Boko Haram on Wednesday after a fierce battle in which dozens of militants were killed. The name \"Boko Haram\" translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The fate of the schoolgirls abducted from Chibok remains unknown despite an announcement in October that Nigerian officials had reached a ceasefire deal with the group that included the girls' release. But weeks later, the girls are still missing and the group's leader has denied ever making such a deal. Also Friday, a suicide bomber killed six people, including three police officers, and injured five others when he blew up his car at a gas station in northern Nigeria's largest city of Kano, police said. The bomber, who police suspected to be a Boko Haram \u200eterrorist, detonated the explosives concealed in his car as he lined up for fuel, Kano State Police Commissioner Adenrele Shinaba told reporters at the scene.",

        "article": "An Alabama jail has a history of medical negligence so serious that at least three seriously ill inmates have died while incarcerated at the facility, claims a series of lawsuits filed in recent weeks. The suits claim officials at Madison County Jail withheld medical treatment from inmates despite obvious signs that each was critically ill. What's more, the suits allege officials did it just to save a buck. 'They wait and wait and wait and hope it goes away. That's a formula for killing people,'\u00a0civil rights attorney Hank Sherrod told CNN. Died of gangrene: Deundrez Woods died in Madison County jail in Alabama in 2013 after authorities let a foot infection get so out of hand it killed him, claims a shocking lawsuit . Indifferent medical staff? Nikki Listau died after alcohol withdraw caused her to fall off a bunk an break bones including a femur and was left unattended by medical staff, the suit claims . Sherrod is representing the families of three inmates who died while at Madison County jail's\u00a0medical-watch area instead of in a hospital receiving medical treatment, where the suit claims they should have been. Sherrod's most shocking claims surround the youngest of the deceased, 19-year-old Deundrez Woods. Woods was booked in June 2013 on shoplifting and assault charges. For weeks, court filings say, the teen seemed fine. But then an infection on his foot became so extreme that it began to have a stench. At first, all the care he received was a hose down from the guards. Not until 'Woods was confused, hallucinating and unable to communicate with correction and medical personnel,' was he taken to the medical unit of the jail, the lawsuit reads. He died of a blood clot from his gangrenous foot 15 days later, reports CNN. During that time, the suit alleges he was left naked and alone in a cell with no water where he didn't eat. 'They just watched him,' Sherrod said. 'They were happy to let him lie there ... totally indifferent to what was really going on.' Rather save a buck? Three lawsuits claim that Madison County Jail in Alabama would rather save a few dollars than pay for critically ill inmates' medical treatment . Sherrod claims the same was true months before for 60-year-old Nikki Listau and two months later for Tanisha Jefferson, 30. Listau was booked on harassment charges in March 2010. Her ensuing alcohol withdrawal was so bad that she had a seizure that caused her to fall off her bunk during the night in a medical watch cell, the suit claims. Never saw a hospital: Tanisha Jefferson complained repeatedly of severe abdominal pain that ended up being a fatal bowel obstruction, the suit sasys . She broke a femur and several ribs during the fall, says the suit, Her court hearing was canceled,, but she was not taken to a hospital. Two hours later the suit says Listau was found unconscious and she died the following day. Jefferson's death came on October 31, 2013 following an arrest for harassment. She first complained of severe abdominal pain and constipation on October 19. Her only medical treatment was a prescription for laxatives before her death, her lawsuit states, despite repeated pleas to jail staff that she feared for her life. 'If I die, it's on y'all,' \u00a0the mother of three allegedly told jailers. The suit says that's precisely what happened due to lack of proper medical treatment when she died of a major bowel obstruction . 'What connects them all is that all of these people were in the medical-watch area, supposedly under the care of nurses,' said Sherrod. County attorney Jeff Rich says all three cases are being vigorously defended. The county has declined to comment further on the pending litigation. The suits seek compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees for the families of the three deceased.",

        "article": "Oisin Tymon (above), the producer at the centre of the Jeremy Clarkson 'fracas', fears the incident could cost him his career, sources claim . The BBC producer involved in the 'fracas' with Jeremy Clarkson is terrified he is going to lose his job, sources claimed. Oisin Tymon has been working  on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005 and was previously an assistant producer on BBC One's The One Show. But the 36-year-old has been in hiding all week after it emerged he had been punched by the presenter at a Yorkshire hotel after a day of filming on March 4. One insider close to his legal team at Slater and Gordon described Tymon as 'mortified'. 'He is terrified that he might lose the job he loves and has been doing for the past six years. All he wants to do is get back to work,' they told the Sunday Mirror. 'He is mortified by the whole thing.' The comments were made after it was revealed that the producer has become the target of online trolls and death threats. One Twitter user @CurtisBetts wrote: 'If they don't bring @JeremyClarkson back I'll be throwing punches Oisin Tymon.' And @KHJRobinson added: 'If Clarkson is sacked, will Oisin Tymon be the most hated man in the UK?' Details about the incident have ranged in detail. One report claimed the 54-year-old presenter split Tymon's lip after he came back to the hotel to find only a cold meat platter was on offer for dinner. Other sources suggested the 40-minute row was not entirely about the lack of food. Lawyers for both parties will put their cases to an independent inquiry, which starts tomorrow. Tymon, 36, has been in hiding all week after it emerged he had been punched by the presenter at a Yorkshire hotel after a day of filming on March 4. Clarkson is pictured at a Champions League game on March 11 after the incident was made public . Tymon has been working on the Top Gear franchise in various roles since 2005. Clarkson (right) is pictured with some of the crew while filming the popular show in 2011 . Clarkson started the disciplinary process himself after phoning Danny Cohen, director of television at the BBC, to apologise about the row. AA Gill, a friend of Clarkson, confirmed the presenter made the first move in the hope that it would end tension. 'He explained he had lost his rag after a difficult and tiring day,' The Sunday Times reported him saying. Cohen immediately suspended Clarkson and pulled the last three episodes of the popular show. Clarkson is being represented by law firm Olswang, which refused to comment. Paul Daniels, representing Tymon, added that his client did not wish to add a statement. The inquiry will report back to Cohen and Lord Hall, director general, who will decide on the pair's fate. It is not known how long it will take. It has also emerged that Clarkson called BBC director of television Danny Cohen (pictured) after the row \u00a0to apologise . An inquiry will be launched tomorrow - until then it is not known what the future is for Clarkson or Tymon. The presenter has changed his Twitter biography to reflect the unknown, adding 'probbably' (sic) to his description . Lord Hall refused to 'speculate' on Clarkson's future after details of the incident emerged and said the BBC's internal investigation would 'get the people who are impacted by this together'. He said: 'There is a lot of speculation, we have got to establish the facts and I intend to do that before we come to a final decision. 'That is what we are about to do.' But BBC management sources have claimed that Top Gear would survive without Clarkson as other shows \u2013 including Have I Got News For You and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 have coped with the loss of a much-loved presenter. They added about Tymon: 'We would hope he will continue to be employed by the BBC after this matter is resolved.' Meanwhile, a petition to reinstate Clarkson has gathered more than 870,000 signatures. This evening Clarkson jokingly made reference to the pulled show by tweeting a picture of darkness with the caption 'and tonight on Top Gear'. The BBC launched an astonishing attack on Jeremy Clarkson yesterday, comparing him to sex offender Jimmy Savile and urging him to check into rehab. Blaming the now notorious 'fracas' with a Top Gear producer on 'personal issues', one of the most senior Corporation executives said Clarkson was 'self-destructing' and needed help. Most controversially, the TV chief, who has been directly involved in the fallout from the incident, likened Clarkson's supporters \u2013 including the Prime Minister \u2013 to those who turned a blind eye to Savile's appalling crimes. Last night, friends of the 54-year-old presenter expressed disbelief that the BBC should make such explosive claims before its internal investigation into the controversy had even begun. 'I am in total shock that someone at the BBC would attack their own talent and deliberately smear Jeremy,' said Perry McCarthy, who was Top Gear's mysterious test driver The Stig. The comments came during a wide-ranging official briefing given to The Mail on Sunday by a senior BBC figure. The executive likened 36-year-old Tymon's position to that of Savile's victims, who feared they would not be believed while he was alive. 'The pressure this guy [Tymon] is under is so Savilesque in a way,' he said, adding that Clarkson's support from high-level politicians recalled the way Savile was once defended. 'If you look at what David Cameron says or what [former Culture and Media Secretary] Maria Miller says and you swap Clarkson for Savile, you get this: David Cameron is effectively saying that Savile's a real talent, Maria Miller saying Savile will be Savile.' The BBC executive also said that attempts to suggest the \u2018fracas\u2019 was part of a wider battle between Clarkson and Danny Cohen, the BBC\u2019s powerful director of television, were misleading.",

        "article": "Rory McIlroy's father Gerry stands to collect \u00a350,000 now his superstar son has won the British Open Championship - and three friends of his will also each collect \u00a350,000 for the win they predicted 10 years ago. And there will be a lot of other happy punters today now McIlroy has sealed the deal - including another two family friends from Holywood who are believed to be in line for \u00a340,000 each on a Rory win. Ten years ago, Gerry McIlroy placed a \u00a3100 bet at odds of 500/1 that his son would win the Open Championship's Claret Jug by the age of 25. Scroll down for video . Great team: Rory McIlroy  with his father and playing partner Gerry McIlroy during the final practice round of The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in 2009 . Rory McIlroy is in pole position to win The Open Championship after moving six shots clear at Hoylake . The bet was placed with remarkable prescience in 2004, when McIlroy was a 15-year-old prodigy. Three friends of McIlroy's father also bet \u00a3100 each (\u00a3100 was the most that the bookie's would allow). A third Major victory at the age of 25 means McIlroy is now one of the all-time greats - as has completed three of four legs of a career grand slam, achieved only six times before in history. Rory McIlroy kisses the Claret Jug trophy after winning the British Open Golf championship . Despite some confusion yesterday over the terms of his father's bet, it was confirmed by McIlroy's agent that the bet is for Rory McIlroy to win the Open by the age of 25, meaning before he turns 26. He is 25 this year, having passed the milestone on May 4. McIlroy's agent said the bet was valid this year. 'This is the last year of the bet, so if Rory wins, Gerry wins,' he said at the time. Andrew Cotter of the BBC also tweeted yesterday that he spoke to Gerry, who confirmed that the bet still stood. Mr Cotter wrote: 'It was by the age of 25. So I asked the man himself. This year still counts.' Gerry worked 100 hours a week and his wife Rosie did night shifts at a factory in their home of Holywood in County Down to save to send Rory to U.S. competitions as a junior. When talk of the bet first emerged, Gerry was quoted as saying: 'It's ridiculous really, isn't it? You realise you can make more money on the golf tour in one week than some people make in a lifetime.' When McIlroy won his first major championship, the U.S. Open, by a record margin in 2011, his father spoke about the bet. He said: 'That was all the bookies would let us put on, \u00a3100 apiece. But that bet is looking better and better.' A Ladbrokes . spokesman said: 'The payout for Rory winning the tournament is . approaching \u00a32.5m, so it's safe to say that we won't be celebrating this . time tomorrow. 'In fact, we'll be drowning our sorrows with a Guinness or two.' Rory McIlroy hugs his father Gerry after winning the PGA Championship.. PGA Championship golf in 2012 . Prodigy: Golfer Rory McIlroy with his parents Gerry and Rosie . Gerry and Rosie McIlroy in 2006 . Rory . with his parents Rosie and Gerry after winning the 2009 Dubai Desert . Classic on the Majilis Course at the Emirates Golf Club in 2009 . Rory McIlroy and his father Gerry at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in St Andrews, Scotland . Rory McIlroy celebrates with his father, Gerry, after winning the U.S. Open Championship golf tournament in Bethesda, Maryland . It will not be the first time a fan of McIlroy has profited from his feats. One member of Holywood Golf Club had more reason than most to celebrate after his 2011 U.S. Open victory at Congressional. He landed a small fortune, believed to be around \u00a325,000, on a bet placed when McIlroy was a promising youngster. It is understood the shrewd punter at McIlroy's home town club got odds of 500/1 when he put \u00a350 on the teen prodigy to win a Major before age 25. As it happened, McIlroy won his first Major at the age of 22. After one of McIlroy's lap-the-field performances in the 2011 U.S. Open, another Irish great, Padraig Harrington, said: 'Rory has been lapping the field. 'There might be people capable of winning a Major, but there are not many people capable of dominating and running away from the field in a Major.' McIlroy's victory today sees him join Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three majors by the age of 25. Meanwhile, model Nadia Forde isn't there to cheer him on today, despite speculation that she might turn up. She is in Florida, where she is relaxing after her recent car crash. There has been much speculation in recent weeks that the pair are an item. However, both have denied it. McIlroy recently broke off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki amid a welter of publicity.",

        "article": "By . Becky Barrow and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 5 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 6 November 2013 . The house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by \u00a343,000. Prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018, according to estate agents Savills, fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who cannot afford to buy. The property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years \u2013 from \u00a3171,000 to \u00a3214,000. It comes as house prices surged by 6.9 per cent annually in October, continuing their fastest rise in more than three years, Halifax has reported. What does the future hold for UK house prices? This map from Savills shows their predicted trends over the next five years. View the full version here. A 0.7 per cent month-on-month increase took prices to \u00a3171,991 on . average - marking the ninth monthly rise in a row as the new phase of . the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched. The annual increase was the strongest since May 2010 and follows a 6.2% year-on-year upswing the previous month. But the jump will be even greater in some regions, with average prices expected to rise by 32 per cent in the South East and 31 per cent in the East. A 24 per cent increase is forecast in London. Savills said that fuelled by an economic recovery, the upswing in prices is likely to be strongest in the South of England following 'a modest, but progressive improvement in mortgage lending'. Its report said that the 'ripple effect' from London is 'long overdue'. Lucian Cook, of Savills, insisted yesterday that widespread fears of a housing bubble are misplaced. Price explosion: Housing market experts have predicted property price increases of up to 31.9% in the next five years . He said: \u2018We see no evidence of an imminent housing bubble and think it an unlikely prospect.\u2019 Soaring house prices, and a predicted rise in the number of people buying property, will trigger a huge windfall for the Treasury through stamp duty. By 2018, the fee could be worth \u00a39.4billion a year, according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. At its previous peak in 2007/8, the year the financial crisis struck, stamp duty was worth \u00a36.7billion, but the value of the tax to the Treasury is set to balloon. Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said the amount of money paid by homebuyers \u2018reinforces the need for reform\u2019 of the \u2018much-criticised\u2019 tax. Stamp duty used to be charged at 1 per cent on all homes bought for more than \u00a360,000. Today it is charged at five different rates \u2013 up to 7 per cent on homes bought for more than \u00a32million. Around half of stamp duty is paid by people buying homes for more than \u00a3500,000. In a sign of Britain\u2019s increasingly unaffordable housing market, the average cost of a one-bedroom home has surpassed \u00a3500,000 in areas of the capital including Chelsea, Kensington, Balham, Barnes and Battersea. A report from estate agents Marsh & Parsons revealed the average price of a one-bedroom property has jumped by 14 per cent in a year, an increase of \u00a362,000. House prices have been rising every year since 1996, apart from a short pause during the recent recession, according to Halifax. The bank\u2019s house price index, which began in 1983, an average rise of 5.6 per cent a year over the last 30 years. In a sign of the property crisis facing young people, the Government\u2019s English Housing Survey, shows home ownership is collapsing. At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were \u2018owner-occupiers\u2019. Today the figure is just 65.3 per cent. And the majority of England\u2019s 14.4million homeowners, 30 per cent, are aged 65 and over. Duncan Stott, of first-time buyers\u2019 campaign group, Priced Out, said: \u2018Such steep increases will be a disaster for first-time buyers who are already struggling to afford the high cost of a home of their own.\u2019 The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is calling for new rules which would cap house price rises at a maximum of 5 per cent\u00a0 a year. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said that outside central London, the housing market is still \u201cfar from boom territory\u201d. He said: 'With household finances still fragile after five years of falling real earnings, we are not convinced that a country-wide boom is around the corner.' He said recent speculation that the Government is considering a capital gains tax on overseas property buyers 'is perhaps an early signal that the authorities are becoming more aware of the risks of another house price bubble inflating'. Much of the recent sharp increase to property prices in prime central London has been put down to strong demand from overseas buyers looking for a safe haven to invest amid the troubles of the eurozone. Halifax pointed out that ultra-low interest rates, as the base rate remains at a historic 0.5 per cent low, have put mortgage payments for new borrowers at their most affordable for 14 years, which is helping to fuel demand. Mortgage payments typically take up 27 per cent of disposable earnings for a new mortgage borrower, the lowest proportion since 1999 and well below the average of 36 per cent over the past 30 years. The new phase of Help to Buy, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent, had been expected to get under way in January, but it was brought forward to last month in a surprise move by the Government. State-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland are offering products under the scheme and other major lenders including HSBC and Santander have confirmed their plans to join at a later date. Despite the strong price uplifts, Halifax said the quarterly measure of price rises has shown some signs of a slight cooling off. Prices in the three months to October were 1.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months. This rate is below the increases of 2 per cent or above recorded in each of the previous four months. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: 'Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence supported by the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be under way, are helping to increase housing demand. 'Schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy also appear to have boosted demand.' He added: 'Sentiment towards selling has also improved in recent months in response to the pick-up in the market, which should help to increase the availability of properties on the market over the coming months.'",

        "article": "Rowan Williams:\u00a0The former Archbishop of Canterbury told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival he knew two clerics who were being held hostage by Islamists in the Middle East . Rowan Williams used a literary festival speech to raise the plight of two Christian archbishops kidnapped by Islamic extremists in Syria. The former Archbishop of Canterbury told an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival he knew two clerics who were being held hostage in the Middle East. He spoke of them in a wide-ranging talk on 'Rights, Law and Religion', in which he insisted the West can't ignore the 'poisonous' effects of religious-inspired tyranny in the region. Lord Williams had been asked by a woman in his audience if it was not time for the Church of England and the country to speak out about what is happening to Christians in the Middle East. 'Five hundred Christians including women and children have been buried alive,' she said. 'They have been executed and thousands of Christians have been confined. 'Surely it is time we spoke up on that? It cannot suely be open season on Christians entirely yet?' Lord Williams replied: 'I couldn't agree more. 'Many have been speaking up and I hope more will. One of the dangers we face at the moment is the rise of a particular kind of religious tyranny in that region whose results both locally and globally are lessons for us all. 'We cannot turn our backs on that. I have people I know who are currently being held in the Middle East including two Bishops in Syria and I am waiting to find out their fate. 'It is not academic - I am glad there are people speaking out.' He did not name the pair, but he was apparently referring to Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church. Gunmen pulled the pair from their car and killed their driver in April last year while they were traveling outside the northern city of Aleppo. Bishop Tony Yazigi of the Damascus-based Greek Orthodox Church said at the time that the gunmen were believed to be Chechen fighters from Jabhat al-Nusra, a radical Islamist faction in the Syrian opposition. Such radicals have become increasingly influential among rebels, attacking Christians \u2014 a sizable minority in Syria who they see as infidels \u2014 partly as punishment for their support of President Bashar Assad. Assad's government has meanwhile sought to portray itself as a protector of religious minorities, expending much effort in defending Christian holy sites and villages. The quick rise of the so-called Islamic State, a Sunni insurgent group which has gained control of much of north-east Syria and northern Iraq, has helped the pariah regime to position itself as moderate and multicultural. Kidnapped:\u00a0Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church, left, and\u00a0Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church, right, were kidnapped by Islamist gunmen close to Aleppo, northern Syria, last year . War zone:\u00a0Lord Willams was apparently referring to Bishop Boulos Yazigi of the Greek Orthodox Church and Bishop John Ibrahim of the Assyrian Orthodox Church who were snatched near Aleppo, pictured . Mr Williams, asked to compare IS with the evils committed in the past by the Christian church, admitted there could be such a thing as 'toxic religion'. Pointing out that most Muslims see IS as breaking cherished religious laws, he conceded that in Christian history, too, there had been 'horrendous periods, where human dignity in the fullest sense has been overruled.' 'Christians endorsed slavery at one time but then provided the arguments which overturned it,' he said. Lord Williams was also asked whether he believes it is right for the Church of England to continue to have a 'privileged position as an established church in a liberal State.' 'My sense of it is that I wouldn't start from here!' he said. ''But at the same time, here is where we are.' His instinct to calls for the Church to be dis-established was to be 'bloody minded,' he said. 'I am a bit inclined to drag my heels and say it is one of the things which allows society to say that the religious perspective still has a foot in the door,' he said. 'Other religious communities feel it allows them to have a foot in the door as well. 'There are people who feel that the Church of England bishops in the House of Lords are there on their behalf. Odd though it is, and quite irrational though it is, I am not in any hurry to get rid of it I must say!'",

        "article": "Tamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by police in Cleveland after brandishing what turned out to be a BB gun . A Cleveland officer was less than 10 feet away when he fatally shot a 12-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun near a playground,\u00a0police said Monday. A surveillance video of\u00a0Tamir Rice's last moments before he was shot on Saturday has been shown to representatives of his family, after they declined to watch their son's shooting. Tamir Rice, was confronted Saturday by officers responding to a 911 call about a male who appeared to be pulling a gun in and out of his pants. The 911 caller said the gun was 'probably fake,' then added, 'I don't know if it's real or not.' Deputy Chief Edward Tomba said Monday that he didn't know whether a dispatcher shared that information with responding officers. The president of the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association has said the officers weren't told the caller thought the gun might be fake. Tamir, who died Sunday, had an 'airsoft' gun that appeared indistinguishable from a real firearm. Airsoft guns fire spherical plastic pellets and have orange tips to show they aren't real firearms, but police said the one the boy had didn't have the bright safety indicator. They say the boy was told to raise his hands and was shot when he pulled the pellet gun from his waistband, though he hadn't pointed it at police or made verbal threats. 'Our officers at times are required to make critical decisions in a split second,' Chief Calvin Williams said. 'Unfortunately this is one of those times.' Scroll down for video . Shooting: On Sunday, Tamir's father, Gregory Henderson,said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down outside Cudell Recreation Center. Above, the BB gun that Tamir was carrying . Scene: Wiping away tears, he said: 'He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' Above, investigators are pictured at the scene of the shooting . Tomba said surveillance video of the shooting is 'very clear' about what occurred, but he wouldn't discuss details of what it shows. Police didn't release the video publicly because it is evidence in the investigation and because they want to be sensitive to the family, the community and the officer, who is distraught, officials said. The two officers involved in the shooting were put on administrative leave under standard procedure. Police haven't publicly identified them. Cleveland police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba, right, and Chief Calvin Wiliams brief reporters Monday on the investigation . The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that the officers are a first-year rookie and a 10-year department veteran. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams  said he spoke to the officer who shot the boy last night: '[He is] holding up pretty well but is broken up about this,' Williams said, adding that the officer 'didn't want to do this, but had to protect himself.' The shooting has led to an investigation of the officer's use of force. It also contributed to a state lawmaker's plan to propose legislation requiring all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips. Too young: Mr Henderson added that he was distraught over the death of his 'superhero', Tamir (pictured), whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic' The police department has collected surveillance video and other evidence and will present it to the county prosecutor's office, the newspaper said without citing a source. It said after reviewing the evidence prosecutors will present the case to a grand jury, which will decide whether the officer was justified in using force against the boy. Once the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury to decide whether any criminal charges should be brought, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said. An attorney for the boy's family, Timothy Kucharski, said Tamir went to the park with friends Saturday afternoon, but he did not know the details of what led to his shooting. He said 'an innocent boy was shot and killed' by a rookie officer.\u00a0According to\u00a09 Action News both of the officers are white. Kucharski said: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a right and wrong issue. This is not a racial issue. 'This is about people doing their jobs the right way.' 'I don't want to make a rush to judgment,' he said. Kucharski said he wants to talk to witnesses himself and get more facts. 'We're ultimately going to find out what happened,' he said. Distraught: 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com. Above, Mr Henderson - who did not wish for his face to be revealed - speaks to reporters following his son's death . Distraught: One of Tamir's relatives is pictured weeping on the ground after hearing of Saturday's shooting . On Sunday Tamir's father Gregory Henderson said the youngster had his whole life ahead of him when he was gunned down. Wiping away tears, he said: 'Who would've thought he would go so soon? He had his whole life ahead. To be 12 years old, he doesn't know what he's doing. Police, they know what they're doing.' He added that he was still shocked at the death of his 'superhero', whom he described as a keen basketball player who was tall for his size, polite and 'very artistic'. 'I'm trying not to cry about the situation but the situation hurts,' he told WKYC.com, adding that he wished police had Tasered his son instead of immediately shooting him. On Sunday, Tamir's family and friends - some of whom had been holding a vigil at the hospital for the youngster - were spotted bringing posters, candles and teddy bears to the area. 'I went to church today and I said a prayer for him and, as soon as I come home, he's dead,' said Kerby Williams, who lives near the scene of the shooting. On Monday, Cleveland's website was hacked and a YouTube video purporting to be from the hacker collective Anonymous was posted referencing website shutdowns and the shooting. City spokesman Daniel Ball said the city couldn't confirm who shut down the site. He said the city was adding extra security measures to prevent a repeat shutdown before restoring the website. State Rep. Alicia Reece of Cincinnati announced Sunday that she will introduce legislation to require all BB guns, air rifles and airsoft guns sold in Ohio to be brightly colored or have prominent fluorescent strips. It is modeled after a bill signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown. Reece said she is introducing the bill in response to the fatal shootings of the boy and 22-year-old John Crawford III. Crawford was fatally shot by police August 5 after a man called 911 to report that Crawford was carrying a gun in a suburban Dayton Wal-Mart store. Police said they believed the air rifle Crawford had picked up was a real rifle and that he didn't respond to commands to drop it. A special grand jury concluded police officers' actions were justified. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the shooting.",

        "article": "Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- For one trapped miner in a collapsed mine in Chile, \"Hope\" weighs only 7 pounds. Esperanza, which means hope in Spanish, is the name of Ariel Ticona's baby girl. She is also believed to be the first child born to any of the 33 miners during their nightmarish weeks buried underground. Esperanza was born Tuesday in a hospital about an hour's drive down a winding mountain road from the mine where her father is trapped. Ticona and his wife, Elizabeth Segovia, learned they were having a girl the day before the mine cave-in. They had planned to call her Carolina. The girl's birth was not just a celebration for Ticona, his father said. \"Immediately it gave all the miners there a lot of excitement,\" Hector Ticona said. \"They were all very happy about her birth and that she will be called Esperanza.\" The day after the birth, Hector Ticona carried Chilean newspapers he was saving for his son with front-page photos of Elizabeth holding the new baby. The story of the baby's birth has been reported as far away as New Zealand, Germany and Singapore, and Esperanza has become a symbol that life continues for the miners despite their underground imprisonment. Photos released from their hospital room showed a tiny baby, her eyes shut tight and with no idea that she is already famous at birth. The decision to change her name arrived to Ticona in the mine's depths. That all the miners had survived the cave-in and then the 17 days it took rescuers to drill the holes that found them was already miraculous. But their continued physical and mental well-being was far from assured. Faced with the fact that he and his fellow workers were about to experience an isolating darkness that no one had ever endured before, Ticona put pen to paper. The letter he wrote reached his family through what the Chileans call \"palomas,\" metal tubes that carry food, supplies and messages to the trapped men. \"He said, 'What if we call her Hope?'\" Hector Ticona recalled. \"Hope for the camp backing us, hope for getting us out of here, hope to keep fighting for my daughter, hope to unite my family.' \" Ticona's wife agreed to the new name. For her, though, the experience would be a tug of war between worrying for her unborn child and for her trapped husband. \"I have been talking to her and telling her Daddy's OK,\" Segovia told CNN a few weeks before she gave birth. \"I can't cry because she would feel everything.\" Before the mine collapse, Ticona promised Segovia he would be in the room when she gave birth. He had not been present for the births of their two sons, one time because he wanted to watch a beloved soccer team play and the other time because of \"squeamishness,\" Segovia said. Segovia decided to have the birth of their daughter videotaped. But videotaping a natural birth was against hospital policy. So, to get around the policy, she had a Caesarean section on camera. Family members say mother and daughter have been released from the hospital and are doing fine. Over a video conference system that is one of their links to the outside world, Ticona was shown the birth of his daughter, deep in the mine. \"We sent the video and Ariel was very happy,\" engineer Rene Aguilar said. \"It was a very beautiful moment for them.\" Around Camp Hope, the encampment that runs up the entrance to the mine where many families have moved to wait out the miners' rescue, word of Esperanza's birth brought joy. As she sat in a light blue tent at Camp Hope, Nelly Burgue\u00f1o said it is a joy she hopes to experience herself soon. Her son, trapped miner Victor Zamora, and his wife also are expecting a daughter. When the girl is born in six months' time, Burgue\u00f1o said, the couple has decided to call her Paz Victoria, or Peace Victory. \"I am going to be a father,\" Burgue\u00f1o said her son wrote her. \"I am happiest man in the world even though I am in the depths of the earth. I want to share this happiness with everyone in the world, with you, Mom, and my brothers.\" Burgue\u00f1o said her son has been \"reborn.\" \"He wrote me,\" she said, \"that even in the deepest part of the earth there shines light.\" CNN's Karl Penhaul and Esprit Smith contributed reporting to this article.",

        "article": "Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted. Leonardo Jardim says Monaco's performance in the Champions League shows you don't need to buy big . Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. The days of the French club signing big names like James Rodriguez (left) and Radamel Falcao are over . 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. Arturo Vidal (left) scored the only goal from the penalty spot to put Juventus in the ascendency . Luca Marrone (from left), Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli take part in a training session . 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.' Monaco will be without striker Lacina Traore and midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, who are both nursing leg injuries. Juventus are without midfielder Paul Pogba (hamstring) and defender Martin Caceres (ankle). Juventus' coach Massimiliano Allegri (centre) knows his side need to be wary over the French side . Andrea Pirlo (centre left) leads some of his team-mates on a jog during the training session . Carlos Tevez has been in fine form for the Italian side and will need to be at the top of his game on Wednesday .",

Alan Pardew admits there are no more excuses after persuading owner Mike Ashley to invest \u00a340million in his Newcastle squad this summer. The United manager signed off from last season with supporters calling for him to be sacked after a horrendous run of 15 defeats in 21 from Christmas onwards. That led to a frank discussion between Pardew and his billionaire boss and the upshot was nine new players, headed by \u00a312m France playmaker Remy Cabella. Ready to go: Newcastle players train ahead of their season opener against Manchester City . Good business: Jamaal Lascelles (left) and Karl Darlow (right) are among the players signed by Alan Pardew . Top acquisition: Summer signing Remy Cabella is expected to play a major role for Newcastle this season . And, ahead of Sunday's opener at home to champions Manchester City, Pardew said: \u2018It was fairly obvious that he (Ashley) listened to me at the back end of last year and the support I\u2019ve had in terms of the new signings is exactly what was needed. \u2018I\u2019ve nothing to moan about now in terms of what\u2019s happened this summer. We\u2019ve got a strong squad, perhaps the biggest and best I\u2019ve ever had in terms of options, so we\u2019re in a great position.\u2019 He went on: \u2018When I signed the new (eight-year) contract, Mike always knew there would be ups and downs for both of us. \u2018He stood by me and this feels like an up time for me. He\u2019s armed me again. Stand by me: Pardew is delighted with the way Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has backed him this summer . \u2018One thing I can always give him is an honesty of where we are and he listens \u2013 that\u2019s why so many players have entered the building, we needed them. \u2018It\u2019s that kind of relationship you can only hope for as a Premier League manager and I\u2019m lucky enough to have it. I hope I can repay him this season.\u2019 Pardew, then, is under pressure to deliver from the off and fans, disillusioned at the manner in which last season fell away, are also demanding an instant return. \u2018I have to live with (the pressure) constantly because I live in the city, I\u2019m surrounded by fans and they remind me constantly,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have to shield myself a little bit and almost put myself in a bubble, of trying to do the job to the best of my ability.\u2019",

Samsung has announced that its Galaxy Mega phone \u2013 the biggest smartphone on the global market - will finally be available to consumers in the U.S. from Friday although there have been no announcements made about when it will come to the UK or other regions. With a screen measuring a giant 6.3 inches diagonally, the Mega looks more like a tablet than a phone. Samsung have described it as a hybrid that combines the portability of a smartphone with the immersive experience that a tablet offers for movies, books, music and games. The Galaxy Mega, the biggest smartphone on the global market, finally hits the U.S. on Friday (this image of phone has been sized to look life-sized on a typical desktop monitor) They are confident that the big design will appeal to commuters and others who regularly watch films on their gadgets. 'The newest addition to the Galaxy family balances an optimal viewing experience on a 6.3-inch HD screen, yet is ultra-thin and portable enough to put into a pocket or hold in one hand,' the firm said. 'The GALAXY Mega offers a mix of popular smartphone and tablet features such as an effortless user experience, a split screen, multitasking between video and other apps and more.' It claims video and web browsing will be the main uses for the Mega. A phone too far? The Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone was the first 'phablet' but now an even bigger version has been launched . Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' to be a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5 inches diagonally. The word comes from blending phone and tablet. Samsung's Galaxy Note was the first popular 'phablet'. Shipments of gadgets that are 5 inches or bigger in screen size are predicted to surge nearly nine-fold to 228 million during the next three years. Estimates vary because no one can agree on where smartphones stop and phablets start. AT&T says it will start selling the Mega on Friday for $150 with a two-year service contract. The Mega is also coming to Sprint and U.S. Cellular. Dates and prices weren't announced for those carriers. The U.S. is playing catchup with the Mega as the phone has already been available in Europe, Russia, and Samsung's home base of South Korea since May. 'We are aware of a great potential in the bigger screen for extensive viewing multimedia, web browsing, and more,' said JK Shin of Samsung. 'We are excited to provide another choice to meet our consumers\u2019 varying lifestyles, all while maintaining the high-quality features of the award-winning GALAXY series.' However, some critics are less impressed and say the new size is too big to be considered a cellphone. Samsung is known for big phones. Its flagship Galaxy S4 is 5 inches, while the Galaxy Note 2 is 5.5 inches. Apple's iPhone 5 is 4 inches. Samsung has helped to popularize the so-called 'phablet' category - in which phones approach tablet dimensions - with its original 5.3in Galaxy Note, which was released in 2011. Analysts have deemed a 'phablet' is a mobile gadget with a screen more than 5inches diagonally. The word comes from blending phone and tablet. The rise of the giant phone: Samsung's Galaxy Mega 6.3 is now the biggest phone on the market, dwarfing the iPhone . Samsung is also known for offering a variety of devices, with different screen sizes and prices, to target a range of consumers. Because of that, it's now the leading maker of phones. Apple, by contrast, has been releasing one model a year that targets high-end consumers. A new iPhone is expected this fall. The Mega includes many features available in other recent Galaxy phones. That includes Multi Window, which allows multitasking in a split screen, and Easy Mode, which reduces the number of features and choices for new smartphone users. Mega buyers can choose either nova black or polaris white as the color. As Samsung's phones get larger, at least one of HTC Corp.'s is getting smaller. AT&T announced Monday that it will start selling a smaller version of the HTC One. Called the HTC One Mini, it will have a 4.3-inch screen, compared with 4.7 inches on the standard model. It's also lighter, at 4.3 ounces. The One is 5 ounces. The One Mini will be about $100 cheaper than its big brother. It will be available starting Friday for $100 with a two-year service agreement. Samsung believe the big design will appeal to commuters and others who regularly watch films on their gadgets .",

        "article": "By . Bianca London for MailOnline . We'd just about accepted collagen marshmallows and collagen drinks but the latest food packed with the anti-ageing ingredient might just be a step too far. Tokyo eatery, Zenyaren, serves a variety of the meaty treats, which have been designed to beat wrinkles. The grilled skewers of meat come in frozen blocks of collagen gelatin so they can be licked or crunched just like an ice lolly. Would you eat this all in the name of younger looking skin? A Tokyo eatery serves a variety of the meaty treats, which are packed with collagen and claim to beat wrinkles . This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging. When we are young, skin is made up of 80 per cent collagen. After the age of 25, we lose it at the rate of about one per cent a year. The result is the twin curses of wrinkles and saggy skin. Owners of the Zenyaren restaurant in the capital Tokyo - which invented the dish - say they have become massively popular during Japan's summer heatwave. Chefs prepare traditional skewers of chicken - known as yakitori - but then slowly freeze them in collagen blocks so they keep their freshly barbecued taste. Yum? Japanese skincare specialists believe by adding collagen into the diet via these bizarre meals, the effects of ageing can be slowed down but UK specialist aren't convinced . How do they work?\u00a0This precious protein is the basic building block of the skin, forming mesh-like bonds to hold it firm and stop it sagging. A standard 'two lolly' serving costs just \u00a3 2.50. Regular Koma Izuma, 47, said: 'It is delicious especially when you are trying to keep cool on a hot day. Refreshing and nutritious at the same time - and great for your complexion.' Japanese beauticians believe that eating collagen-rich foods keeps your skin young and wrinkle-free. Tokyo skin expert Tatsuto Tamura explains: 'This has been popular in Japan for generations although only now is it becoming mainstream and known in the West too. 'People here seek out collagen-enriched foods such as chicken, pigs' feet or shark fin because they believe it will help their skin,' he added. In the US, many restaurants now serve special 'wrinkle free' menus of dishes loaded with collagen. But the craze has not, however, impressed British skin specialists, and the British Skin Foundation claims that eating collagen does not benefit the skin in any way. Tasty? Chefs prepare traditional skewers of chicken - known as yakitori - but then slowly freeze them in collagen blocks so they keep their freshly barbecued taste . Cheap as chips:\u00a0A standard two lolly serving costs \u00a32.50 and fans say they're refreshing and nutritious at the same time . Laura Casewell, editor of The Cosmetic Surgery Guide, told the Mail: 'There's a definite move towards improving the skin from the \"inside out\" rather than the \"outside in\" and stimulating our bodies to replace what has been lost.' So can these meaty bites beat your crows feet? UK-based plastic surgeons and dermatologist aren't convinced. Mr Paul Banwell FRCS(Plast) from The Banwell Clinic, said: 'These collagen popsicles sound like a fun idea but unfortunately there is little scientific evidence to support their effectiveness. 'There are a myriad of more effective aesthetic facial treatments available from skilled surgeons and doctors and I would urge the public to seek tried and trusted methods of rejuvenation.' This isn't the first edible collagen to come onto the market. There have been various ranges of collagen-infused marshmallows and sweets that promise to 'reduce the appearance of cellulite, and firm and tone skin'. 'I haven't seen any strong evidence that explains why eating an increased amount of collagen should improve the quantity or quality of collagen in your skin,' says founder of 111SKIN, Dr Yannis Alexandrides. 'Collagen is a type of protein, and works with keratin to provide the skin with strength, smoothness and elasticity - however, it is effectively broken down in your stomach. There's no direct pathway to send collagen to the skin. 'I would suggest a following a healthy, balanced diet and exercise regime to optimise skin health and ensure that your body can manufacture collagen naturally. Can these make you young too? We've previously seen collagen-infused marshmallows and sweets that promise to reduce the appearance of cellulite, and firm and tone skin'",

        "article": "A New York personal trainer pleaded guilty on Thursday to being part of a New Jersey ring that used violence to coerce Jewish husbands to agree to grant their wives religious divorces, federal prosecutors said on Thursday. David Hellman, 31, was one of 10 men, including two Orthodox Jewish rabbis, arrested last fall in the alleged scheme in which they hired themselves out to unhappy wives who wanted their husbands kidnapped and beaten until they agreed to divorce, the prosecutors in New Jersey said. Hellman was charged with 'traveling in interstate commerce to commit extortion,' and the others were charged with kidnapping, according to government documents. Ariel Potash's attorney Jacob Laufer (pictured) answered questions about one of the accused as he left the federal court in New Jersey in October . Orthodox Jewish women cannot get divorces unless their husbands consent through a document known as a 'get,'and wives paid tens of thousands of dollars to the ring that would abduct and beat their husbands, prosecutors said at the time of the arrests in October. Hellman was part of a group that on Oct. 9, with Jay Goldstein, 59, Moshe Goldstein, 31, Avrohom Goldstein, 34, Simcha Bulmash, 30, Ariel Potash, 40, Binyamin Stimler, 38, and Sholom Shuchat, 29, traveled from New York to a warehouse in Edison to force a Jewish man to allow his wife a 'get', . One of the men at the warehouse was an . undercover FBI agent posing as the victim's brother -in-law who arrested . the men. Hellman admitted to helping to plot the abduction.reports APP.com. FBI agents remove evidence from the Brooklyn residence of Rabbi Mendel Epstein during an investigation, early on Thursday . During his guilty proceeding, Hellman also admitted also to going to a man's residence on August 22, 2011 in order to injure and restrain him until he issued his wife the 'get.' His conduct on April 22 will be considered during his June 12 sentencing. Hellman, of Brooklyn, New York could face up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 at his June 12 sentencing. The other nine defendants still face criminal charges. The racket was uncovered in a sting operation in which a pair of FBI agents posing as an Orthodox Jewish wife and her brother were to pay $10,000 up front and another $50,000 for men who would beat her husband, prosecutors said. 'Hellman admitted that they discussed a plan and prepared to confine, restrain and threaten the victim,' the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark, New Jersey, said in a statement. Hellman's defense attorney, Michael Bachner, said his client 'has acknowledged his responsibility for his conduct and he is regretful for it, and looks forward to going on with his life.' Experts say such schemes are in response to so-called 'get abuse,' in which husbands demand a larger share of the couple's communal property before granting the divorce. While a 'get' is not required for a civil divorce, that proceeding would not be recognized by Orthodox leaders and the couple would remain married under Jewish law. The physical trainer admitted that he and others discussed a plan to 'confine, restrain and threaten the victim'",

Experts say sales driven by fear President Obama will change gun laws if he wins a second term . 2012 Doomsday preppers and the popularity of zombie films and television shows have added to the boost in sales since January . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:19 EST, 5 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:04 EST, 5 April 2012 . The unusual combination of 2012 . apocalypse fears, popular killer-zombie shows and the potential . re-election of President Obama has led to a nationwide spike in gun . sales. A similar increase . was noted in 2009 during President Obama's first term and gun dealers . and buyers say they fear what a second term lame duck Obama . administration may do. Sales . have increased to such an extent that manufacturers such as Sturm, . Ruger & Co. are struggling to keep up with the demand. Record year so far: Sales of firearms have increased so much that manufacturers are struggling to keep up with the demand . The . Southport, Connecticut-based company has suspended new orders after . taking over one million requests for guns in the first three months of . this year. 'Sales usually . increase this time of year with tax returns, but this year has been . higher than most,' said Mike Weeks, owner of Georgia Gun Store in . Gainesville, Georgia. 'People are scared their gun rights are going to be curtailed after the election.' Firearms saw a similar boost in sales during the early months of President Obama's first term in 2009 . This follows a record 2011, when nearly 11 million firearms were sold in the U.S according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. The $4 billion guns and ammo industry in America has been one sector that has bucked the depressed economic trend since 2008. Noting his own sales have risen by around 30 per cent, Mr Weeks now says that he sells ammo by the case. 'Usually . people come in to buy three or four boxes for target practice. Now they . are coming in asking what kind of deals they could get on a case,' said . Mr\u00a0 Weeks. The common denominator in these increases according to industry experts is the looming November 6 election. 'It\u2019s definitely the election year,' said Jason Hanson, a former CIA officer and personal security specialist to FoxNews.com. 'People feel that Obama will serve a second term and with it their gun rights taken away, so they are stocking up. Zombies and the Apocalypse: Firearm sales have been boosted by those anticipating 2012 as the end of the world . 'They\u2019re also worried that the economy is not getting any better and that they need to protect themselves.' Upon . President Obama taking office in 2009 firearm enthusiasts have rushed . to dealers worried he would tighten gun control and sales have continued . to grow during his term as President. While . campaigning for office as in 2008 he famously told . fundraisers of his frustration that Midwestern and Rust-Belt voters . 'cling to guns or religion' and many supporters of the Second Ammendment . doubt he is fully behind it. 'He's never been pro-gun,' explained Cris Parsons of his thoughts on President Obama. Mr Parsons, 31, runs a Texas gun depository called the Houston Armory. To . date, explains Parsons, the President has been 'pretty coy' regarding . guns and the gun dealer feels this will remain the case during the . campaign. If President Obama was to adopt a contrary position Mr Parsons reckons it will 'upset a lot of people.' As a backdrop to this, gun makers stocks are rising. Sturm, Ruger & Co's share price has risen 55 percent this year and Smith & Wesson is up 91 percent. A strong litmus test for U.S gun sales is the FBI's National Instant Background Check System. Firearm enthusiasts contributed record sales to the $4 billion industry last year . This allows federally licensed firearm dealers to conduct mandatory background checks on purchasers of new and used weapons. Statistics up until December 2011 indicated a 19th straight month of background check increases year on year. November 25, 2011, saw the record for most background checks in one day --129,166 and became known as 'Black Friday'. However politics aside there are other explanations for the current boom. 'There're the 'preppers,' explained Parsons, 'and then there's this whole Zombie Apocalypse thing.' An entire industry has grown up around preppers and the fear of ancient Mayan prophecies predicting the end of the world. As . many as three million Americans now count themselves in that category . buying up guns, ammo and food in anticipation of a solar flare or . catastrophic asteroid hit before the year is out. Ready for anything: There are an estimated three million preppers in the United States alone . A . staggering 61 per cent of 1,000 polled by the National Geographic . channel believe there will be a catastrophic event in the next 20 years, . and people want to be prepared. Combined . with the preppers is the growth in popularity of Zombie shows such as . 'The Walking Dead' which has led firearms manufacturers to produce . themed guns and bullets. 'We can't keep it in stock,' explained Cris Parsons of his line of Zombie Max ammunition. 'It comes in a cool, colorful box with a Zombie on it.' However, in reality business is booming for the American firearms industry. 'There\u2019s . a lot of speculation that the Second Amendment will be affected by the . next presidential term,' said Bret Jordan, a stock analyst specialising . in firearms to FoxNews.com. 'There . was one investors' call and an executive was asked what he thought would . happen if Obama was elected a second term and he said, \"No one in the . gun industry will tell you they like Obama, but everyone will vote for . him.\"'",

A mother who put up a \u00a310,000 reward after thieves targeted her home has been charged with kidnapping a man she believes was responsible. Tracey Taylor, 41, offered the huge amount of cash for information about the burglar who stole an entire safe from her home while her family were at a funeral. She described her family as 'devastated' by the loss of jewellery and a substantial amount of money, but now she has been charged, along with two men, with kidnapping. Anthony Charles, 43, of Strood, has also been charged along with another man, Johan Van Vwren, 37, . of Sevenoaks, both in Kent. Tracey Taylor, who put up a \u00a310,000 reward after thieves targeted her home in Strood, Kent, has been charged with kidnapping a man she believes was responsible . They allegedly bundled the man into a car which was later intercepted by police. Maidstone Magistrates\u2019 Court heard the man was allegedly kidnapped on the Promenade in Leysdown, Kent. Taylor, also from Strood, appealed for information after burglars broke into her home and prised a safe off the wall in the basement and made off with it on July 31. At the time, the personal trainer said there was a substantial amount of money in the safe along with some jewellery. She said she knew immediately something was wrong as she could see a kitchen window was open. When another occupant, Anthony Charles, went into the basement of the home, he discovered the safe had gone. After the burglary, Miss Taylor put up a poster in her window so people in the area would notice the \u00a310,000 appeal. At the time, she said: 'We were attending the funeral of a family friend, a young man taken from his family too young. Maidstone Magistrates' Court heard the man was allegedly kidnapped on the Promenade in Leysdown, Kent (above, file photo) 'To add to that terrible day, we returned to find our home had been broken into and our personal belongings gone. 'The jewellery has considerable emotional value and we are devastated.' Taylor appeared at Maidstone Magistrates\u2019 Court on Monday charged with kidnap. She was arrested on Sunday on the A249, just past the Sheppey Crossing in Kent. An eyewitness, who saw the arrest, . said: 'I thought there had been an accident at first because you . sometimes see a police car blocking traffic towards the bridge at . Cowstead Corner. 'But . as I was diverted on to the old road towards the Kingsferry Bridge, I . noticed the car had been stopped by two police vehicles, which were . parked ahead and behind it and it was clear there was more to it.' Miss Taylor, Mr Van Vwren and Mr Charles were all charged with 'unlawfully and by the use of force or fraud taking or carrying away [the victim] against his will contrary to common law on August 5, 2012'. A police source confirmed the kidnap charge facing Miss Taylor relates to the break-in at her home. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Officers received a report of a suspicious vehicle on The Promenade in Leysdown on Sunday, August 5, at 12.37pm. 'Officers attended and located the vehicle on the A249 just over the bridge. 'The car was stopped and the occupants spoken with. 'The man was found to be safe and well. 'While officers were at the scene, the road was closed and reopened at 3.18pm. 'Three people were subsequently arrested and were charged with kidnap.' The trio have been bailed to appear before Maidstone Crown Court on August 20. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

        "article": "By . Sam Webb . On the day his former employer announced a staggering \u00a32.5billion loss, former Co-op bank boss Paul Flowers was enjoying an all-night drinking session, it has been claimed. The 63-year-old, who recently underwent a stint in rehab, allegedly invited an escort to his home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in the early hours of last Thursday,   admitting he was 'trolleyed'. The Co-op's loss announcement comes after its banking division plunged into losses last year with Methodist Minister Flowers at the helm. He was filmed by The Mail on Sunday allegedly   buying class A drugs in November. In March he spoke about the drugs allegations, saying: 'I have sinned' and admitted to 'frailties' in an interview with BBC's Newsnight. Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers (centre) with minders at Stainbeck Police Station, Leeds, on Wednesday. A male escort has spoken of being texted by the former minister as he partied on the day the Co-op announced record losses . The escort, 22-year-old Dale Westwood, claims the texts started at 1am and continued until 11am. The pair had met at a party in Bradford, West Yorkshire, last month. Mr   Westwood claims Mr Flowers has repeatedly asked him to visit him, but he has always refused. 'I can't believe he has been so brazen. Most of the bank's failures are down to him, yet he doesn't have a care in the world.' Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Flowers's solicitor Andrew Hollas said the former bank boss would make a 'full statement' following his appearance at Leeds Magistrates Court on May 7. The Crown Prosecution Service said it had 'carefully considered' a file of evidence against Flowers before pressing charges. The escort says Flowers blames the people who employed him for the bank's failures. Reverend Paul Flowers in front of the Treasury Select Committee in November, 2013 . Mr Westwood added that Flowers says those who put him in charge were 'stupid' and was joking about the news stories surrounding him. He told the Sun: 'The Co-op are in a bad way and he doesn't recognise how he has been involved in that - he blames anyone but himself.' Flowers was suspended by both the Methodist Church and the Labour Party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs. Last week Flowers, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, was charged with possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine. Former City Minister Lord Myners was appointed to assess the Co-op Group's system of elections and appointments. He resigned last week in the face of bitter resistance from board members but plans to complete his review.  A separate review by Sir Chris Kelly, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life \u2013 an advisory Government body \u2013 is looking into how the Co-op Bank came close to   collapse last year. His report is expected after Easter.  Last week the bank announced a \u00a31.3\u2009billion loss for 2013 and launched an emergency plan to raise \u00a3400\u2009million to plug a hole in its finances. There have been repeated questions about how Flowers was ever put in charge, despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector. Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a \u00a31.5billion hole was discovered in its finances. Neville Richardson, the former chief executive of the Co-op Bank, blamed the banks\u2019s problems on the way it managed its loan portfolio after he left, but the banker was contradicted by Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, who said the losses mainly derived from assets acquired when the Co-op took over the Britannia Building Society.

        "article": "(CNN Student News) -- September 30, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . \u2022 Cape Town, South Africa \u2022 Chile . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Officials think they've uncovered a terror plot that was targeting Europe. That story leads off this Thursday edition of CNN Student News. From the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Europe Terror Plot . AZUZ: Well, that terror plot, one source says the information comes from a man who was arrested in Afghanistan. He offered up some details about a \"Mumbai-style\" attack in Europe. When we say that, we're talking about the terrorist attack that happened in Mumbai, India two years ago. That is when ten men launched an attack that lasted three days and left more than 160 people dead. This man who told officials about the plot is a German citizen. He was arrested in Afghanistan back in July and is now in U.S. custody. He went to Afghanistan last year and joined a group that's connected to the al Qaeda terrorist group. European officials are looking into the information that they're getting. But German and U.S. officials say, so far, they haven't found any evidence of an imminent attack either in Europe or the United States. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The first lady is a member of the U.S. president's Cabinet. Not true! The first lady can play a big role in a presidential administration, but she is not a Cabinet member. School Lunches . AZUZ: First ladies do have a lot of influence, and they can use that to make an impact on laws and policies. For example, first lady Michelle Obama's big push is to fight childhood obesity. And one of her goals is for Congress to pass a new child nutrition law. We're talking about the school lunch program. It hasn't been updated in about 5 years. This new bill that the first lady is pushing for would offer money to poorer districts to help pay for free meals, and it would require healthier foods in school programs. But it doesn't look like this thing's gonna become law anytime soon. You see, the money for these new programs would come from the food stamp program, and some Democrats think that should be off-limits. One Congressman said, \"We're not going to tolerate robbing the poor to pay for every piece of legislation.\" Fast Food Toy Ban? AZUZ: We've been talking this week about how healthy eating means making choices. You guys can make those decisions for yourselves or talk to your parents about making them. But kids who are younger than you, maybe your little brothers and little sisters, might not know about choosing healthy foods yet. They might just want whatever meal has a toy with it. And that's why some California officials are considering a ban on including toys with some fast food meals. David Stevenson of affiliate KTVU serves up the details. (BEGIN VIDEO) ERIC MAR, SAN FRANCISCO SUPERVISOR: These toys that are used too often as incentives to lure and entice children to the meals. DAVID STEVENSON, KTVU REPORTER: Happy Meals went on trial in San Francisco. JUANITA ALVARODO, SAN FRANCISCO MOTHER: The toy that comes in that unhealthy Happy Meal? There comes a price. STEVENSON: The county's Land Use and Economic Development Committee heard from consumers and McDonald's executives on a proposal to ban restaurants from selling meals with toys like these, unless the food meets certain nutritional standards. MAR: Meals must contains fruits and vegetables and not exceed 600 calories, and must not have beverages that have excessive fat or sugar. STEVENSON: Health advocates say fast food restaurants use these promotional toys to lure low-income children into diets high in sugar, fat and salt. JAMILAH TOOPS, SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT: The youth in my community are getting diet-related diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, at younger and younger ages. KAREN WELLS, MCDONALD'S CORPORATION USA, VICE PRESIDENT OF NUTRITION: We can use the toy in our advertisement to promote and educate on nutrition. We advertise our all-white-meat nuggets, our apple dippers, our low-fat white milk. STEVENSON: The McDonald's corporation flew in executives from Chicago to tout what they describe as healthier menu options and to oppose the measure. WELLS: I'm a parent. I have two small children. I decide what my children will eat and what toy or what the environment will be. And so, banning or putting legislation that undermines what parents choices are, we believe are wrong. STEVENSON: Scott Rodrick owns ten of San Francisco's 19 McDonald's restaurants. He calls the legislation proof of the city's misplaced priorities. SCOTT RODRICK, MCDONALD'S FRANCHISE OWNER: With the limited resources that our city has today, we should be focused on the greater issues: a public safety program that works. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to the students and teachers at Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania!

You'll find those cities in South Africa. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Township Baseball . AZUZ: South Africa played host to this year's soccer World Cup Championship. Those of us who watched it still hear the horns. But there's another sport, one from America, that's gaining popularity in parts of South Africa, including the Cape Town area. And people aren't just focused on what's happening on the field. It's about the sport keeping young people away from stuff off that's off the field, too. Nima Elbagir explains what we mean. (BEGIN VIDEO) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT, CAPE TOWN: Philippe Township on the outskirts of Cape Town, just off the glossy, double-lane highway leading into South Africa's second city. Like many of the other townships ringing Cape Town, the lucky few live in government-built housing. But the vast majority live in shacks. Hundreds of thousands of families with no power, no heat and no running water. South African Townships, like the one behind me, are an incredibly difficult environment for young men. Guns, drugs, crime and a host of other temptations are a daily reality here, but an American import is now offering them a surprising alternative: baseball. Coach Nyameko Gabada introduced the game here four years ago after South Africa did well in the world baseball classic. NYAMEKO GABADA, BASEBALL COACH: I was staying here in Philippe. I found out that it's a lot of crime that is abusing the children of this place. ELBAGIR: While baseball has gained some popularity in South Africa in more affluent areas with access to international sports channels, in the townships, it was all but unheard of. And Coach Gabada said he banked on that novelty to draw in the children. GABADA: Once we started, then they came in interest. Everybody wants to see what is this baseball. And then they started coming in numbers! ELBAGIR: But once the team, the Philippe Angels, was up and running, their success has surprised even the coaches. ROB ROSENBLUM, BASEBALL COACH: The very first season, we started with two teams: under-twelves and under-fourteen. And amazingly, the under-fourteens won their league and the under-twelves came in second. And so, you can imagine the impact that had in the community, where these kids came home with a big trophy and ran around the community celebrating and everything. ELBAGIR: In a neighborhood where there is often little worth celebrating, the teams' success has had a huge impact on the children's confidence and aspirations. LAZOLA NDLANGALAVU: This township, very lot of drugs, bad things happening now. But now, if you do sports, and then you can stop doing drugs, all that stuff, bad stuff. ELBAGIR: And it's not just on the sports field that trophies are being won. To play baseball here, you also commit to academic tutoring. It's already paying off for some of the older children. ROSENBLUM: It's the commitment to something bigger than yourself. It's the hard work, the discipline, everything that comes from that. You transfer that to the rest of your life and you've got a much better chance. And when somebody comes up to talk, they don't say, \"Thank you for spreading baseball.\" They don't say anything like that. What they say is, \"Thank you for getting these kids off the street.\" ELBAGIR: Nima Elbagir, CNN, Cape Town. (END VIDEO) Chile Mine Rescue . AZUZ: From South Africa to South America for an update on those 33 men trapped in a mine in Chile. They're not out, not yet. But there is some progress in the rescue efforts. One of the drills that's making a hole big enough for these guys to get out hit the halfway point yesterday. That's something. Officials are looking at early November for when they think the rescue operation will actually happen. Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, I'm Carl Azuz, and you're watching CNN Student News! Now, you hear me say something like that just about every day to introduce the show. Now, we want you to do it! This is what we talked about yesterday. We want you to introduce CNN Student News! It has to be through an iReport, and you can find out how to make and send in one of those by checking out the \"How Do I...\" bin at CNNStudentNews.com. One rule here: You have to be at least 13 years old to send us an iReport. So, if you're old enough -- at least 13 -- grab a camera, give us your name and your best show intro, and maybe we'll see you saying \"this is CNN Student News.\" Goodbye . AZUZ: If you're pundering how to do this, just take a little time for introspection. All right, you know we were gonna have some sort of pun there, but we really are looking forward to what you come up with. And plus, it'll give me a break at the start of the show, and I'd appreciate that. We thank you for tuning in today. Friday's edition of CNN Student News -- you know it -- it's gonna be awesome!",

        "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:32 EST, 21 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:32 EST, 21 October 2013 . Shamed U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong was at the head of an 'organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people' and he 'belongs in jail.' That's according to cycling great Greg LeMond, who gave a scathing critique of his sport's most recognizable athlete during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night. According to LeMond, Armstrong would have been a 'top 30 at best' cyclist if not for his now-infamous doping regiment and he is 'not capable of winning the Tour de France' if not for the help of banned substances. 'Criminal': Greg LeMond (left) says that shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong (right) belongs in jail . In 2012, Armstrong was banned from competitive cycling and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his admitted use of performance enhancing drugs. Stripping Armstrong of his titles leaves LeMond as the only American to ever win the prestigious race. After years of denials, Armstrong admitted in January that he had in fact used performance enhancing drugs during a much-hyped interview with Oprah Winfrey. LeMond is one of the first people to suggest that Armstrong was using banned substances. In 2001, he questioned his relationship with Michele Ferrari, a doctor linked to several doping scandals. In April, LeMond spoke at a symposium in Austin, Texas, where he told the crowd that he had 'no vendetta' against Armstrong and that 'I don't rejoice' in the fact that he was stripped of his Tour de France titles. Cheater: Armstrong admitted earlier this year that he used performance enhancing drugs during his career as a cyclist . However, he was much more critical of Armstrong during his interview with Cooper. When asked whether Armstrong perpetrated the biggest fraud in sports history, LeMond responded with 'Absolutely. Absolutely. The greatest fraud was that, I mean, I know his . physical capabilities. He's a top 30 at best. I mean, at best. No matter . what. If he was clean and everybody else was clean, he's a top 30 at . best. He's not capable of winning the Tour. He's not capable of the top 5.' He went on to say that Armstrong's offenses are 'criminal' and that 'this is not a sporting infraction.' 'This was an organized mafia and he literally tried to destroy people,' LeMond said. He went on to say that Armstrong belongs in jail. Armstrong was at the center of a federal criminal fraud investigation until the Justice Department abandoned the investigation last year without an explanation. Banned: Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from the sport for using PEDs . However, there is still an open civil case against Armstrong claiming that he defrauded the U.S. Postal Service - his primary sponsor - out of $40 million. The USPS says it never would have sponsored Armstrong - or paid him the millions of dollars in sponsorship money - had it known he was using performance enhancing drugs. LeMond has won the Tour de France three times.",

        "article": "Fish are often classed as ugly, slimy creatures but these latest images reveal their inner beauty. Each of the marine specimens have been bleached to make the skin clear and then stained to expose their complex and elegant skeletons. They include the Spiny Lumpsucker, the Little Skate and the Butterfly Ray and form part of the Cleared exhibition due to go on display in Seattle in March. The fish in the Cleared exhibition, including the including this Scalyhead Sculpin, pictured, were bleached before being dyed to make the stained skeletal tissue visible through the skin and flesh. They were then submerged in a large container of glycerine and photographed in various poses. The process is used in the science of Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics . The project was created by Professor Adam Summers, associate director of Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics at Washington University. He collected the specimens from various fisheries, with many having died during scientific studies. One study, for example, had focused on the developmental trajectory of the fish skeleton. The fish were treated at the Biomechanics Lab at Friday Harbour in Washington. Each fish was stained using two specific dyes - Alcian Blue to stain the cartilaginous elements deep blue, and Alizarin Red S to turn the tissue a crimson colour. The fish were then bleached in hydrogen peroxide to remove any dark pigments. The fish, including this Spiny Lumpsucker, were treated at the Biomechanics Lab at Friday Harbour in Washginton. Each fish was stained using two specific dyes: Alcian Blue to stain the cartilaginous elements deep blue, and Alizarin Red S to turn the tissue a crimson colour. The fish were then bleached in hydrogen peroxide to remove any dark pigments . The project was created by Professor Adam Summers, associate director of Comparative Vertebrate Biomechanics at Washington University. He collected the specimens, including this Little Skate, from various fisheries, fish that died during scientific studies and from a study on the developmental trajectory of the fish skeleton . Flesh from the specimens were dissolved in a digestive enzyme called Trypsin which removed the protein, but left the collagen that holds the bones and skin together intact. To make the fish appear invisible, each specimen was then submerged in glycerine and placed into various poses before being photographed using a Canon 5D Mark III camera fitted with a 100mm Macro lens. Professor Summers told Seattle Aquarium, where the display is being held: \u2018This technique is only effective on specimens that are less than about 1cm in thickness, and takes much longer for thick specimens than thin. Flesh from the specimens were dissolved in a digestive enzyme called Trypsin which removes the protein, but leaves the collagen that holds the bones and skin intact, as seen in this Butterfly Ray. To make the fish appear invisible, each specimen was then submerged in glycerine and placed into various poses before being photographed using a Canon 5D Mark III camera fitted with a 100mm Macro lens . 'A small fish might take three days to process while a larger animal could take several months.' Professor Summers continued that he has a camera on a tripod and uses a remote shutter release to take the shots each time. To make sure the glycerine is still, Professor Summers said he poses the fish and leaves the set up for several hours before taking the images. The glycerine is placed on a colour corrected LED light table to highlight the specimens. There are 14 specimens in total in the display. The six featured here include the Spiny Lumpsucker, Little Skate,\u00a0 Scalyhead Sculpin, Butterfly Ray and Whitespotted Greenling. Professor Summers said that he has a camera on a tripod and uses a remote shutter release to take the shots each time . To make sure the glycerine was still and there were no light reflections, Professor Summers said he posed the fish and left the set up for several hours before taking the images. He then shot them using a camera on a tripod with a remote shutter control .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Alanna Gerwitz-Stern hadn't worked out a day in her life. She never watched what she ate, either. But after having her first son, Jacob, in December 2009, she couldn't seem to shake the baby weight. Stern had gained more than 100 pounds during the pregnancy, reaching 230 pounds at 5 feet 6 inches tall. She hid under sweatpants, sweaters and athletic gear. \"I was embarrassed to even go to the gym,\" says Stern, 33. \"I was so incredibly out of shape, and the people I was working out beside were so incredibly fit. I felt like a real eyesore when I would walk down the street.\" Despite her best efforts to drop the extra weight, she had only managed to lose 10 pounds by the following May. \"I just felt really down on myself,\" Stern says. \"I felt like there was so much more I was capable of, and I didn't want to be one of those women who just accept their weight and that that's their fate as a young mom. I felt like there was a better me.\" Frustrated, Stern remembered hearing about a new gym called Core Concepts near her home in Toronto, Ontario. Core Concepts owner Joshua Lipsey says the idea behind his workouts is that your core -- made up of your abs, obliques, back and glutes -- is your origin of movement. A strong core improves posture and balance and decreases risk of injury. Lipsey's workouts consist of body weight exercises, including beggar's planks, split and bicycle crunches, back extensions and wide-stance plie squats. The core is a major \"problem area\" for many people, Lipsey says. It's the spot men and women tend to notice extra pounds first. But because the core includes several large muscles, working it burns calories fast. As such, attacking the core can lead to quick weight loss results, Lipsey says. After researching Lipsey's concept, Stern decided to walk in and introduce herself. That day, she signed up for classes and started to shed the extra pounds. Lipsey had Stern visualize in front of the mirror, and she began to see the body she wanted. She says that built the motivation she needed to meet her weight loss goals. \"We envisioned what my waist, stomach and arms were going to look like, and we just stayed on that path until we were happy with the result,\" Stern says. \"Josh never let me lose sight of how to get there.\" Stern describes Lipsey's concept as unconventional. \"It's not a spin class, it's not a running class, it's not a Pilates class,\" she says. \"He took my fitness to a completely different level, and he really challenged me.\" Lipsey and Stern both emphasize that to see results, you have to change your whole lifestyle. \"If you think the hour that you go to the gym is what counts, it's really not,\" Lipsey said. \"It's doing other things -- going for a walk with your dog, not hopping on the escalator at the mall -- there's all these little things.\" upwave: Try it now! One-minute workout challenge . After about eight months of eating clean -- increasing fruit and vegetable intake while decreasing meat consumption -- and attending core and plyometric classes for an hour a day, six days a week, Stern lost 106 pounds, which was even more than she had gained while pregnant. But shortly after reaching her goal weight, Stern went \"from one extreme to another.\" She got pregnant with twins. This time, however, she was determined to stay on track. She continued to work out until Lily and Levi, now 18 months old, were born. Stern gained just 48 pounds during her second pregnancy. She lost 38 of those pounds within two weeks after giving birth and the last 10 pounds by the end of the year. \"The last 10 pounds were hard, like they usually are for people, but she stuck with it and refused to fail,\" Lipsey says. Aside from feeling physically better than ever, Stern also feels less shy and doesn't avoid going out anymore. She put in the time and effort, and her body responded. \"It was amazing to watch myself accomplish that because the amount of determination it takes to get to that level really is mental just as much as it is physical,\" Stern says. \"There's a lot of mental grit you need to have.\" Having three children poses a challenge for keeping the weight off, but Stern says the time put in is worth it. \"It's one hour a day that I can take to do something good for me,\" she says. \"I come back to my family reinvigorated and ready for whatever challenges in life lie my way.\" With less free time to attend classes at set times, Stern has kept up through Lipsey's mobile app, Gym Tuck, which launched last November. The flexibility of the app has allowed Stern to stay committed to her exercise plan even with three children and a busy schedule after returning to work. While she tries to fit in cardio using a jogging stroller, the app allows her to keep her workouts well-rounded. Now a size 4 and down to 120 pounds, Stern hopes to inspire other mothers trying to stay healthy through multiple pregnancies. \"I feel very, very lucky that I've been able to go through this transformation,\" she says. \"I wouldn't change anything -- not even the part about being overweight and going through that -- because it got me to where I am today. I really am my best self.\"",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Alaskan musher Lance Mackey has won the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and set an Iditarod record for most consecutive wins, according to race officials. Mackey, 39, of Fairbanks has dominated the sport in recent years and is the 2007-2010 Iditarod champion. Mackey completed the 1,049-mile Iditarod race, which was broadcast live on IditarodInsider.com, in just under nine days. He was cheered across the finish line in Nome by family and friends, including his father, Dick Mackey, the 1978 Iditarod champion. The senior Mackey greeted his son at the finish line with a hug, saying, \"You've done something that will never be repeated, son.\" Dick Mackey told race commentators his son \"is highly competitive and he likes to get the best out of his dogs. ... I don't think anybody trains them any better than he does.\" Mackey could be heard on the broadcast microphones speaking to his dog team just before reaching the famous burled arch on Nome's Front Street, \"Nice, nice. This is so cool. We're almost there, guys. You did such a good job.\" Arriving in Nome at 2:59 p.m. local time, Mackey's official time was 8 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 9 seconds. Mackey, a throat cancer survivor who says he began racing \"at birth,\" was inducted into the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame in February \"for capturing multiple titles in two of the world's longest sled dog races.\" Mackey is also a four-time champion of the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest race from Fairbanks to Nome as well as the record holder for the most consecutive first place finishes in that race. Second place in the Iditarod went to Yukon musher Hans Gatt. Past champion musher Jeff King came in third. King, from Denali, Alaska, received praise and gratitude from the Iditarod Trail Committee earlier this season when he donated $50,000 toward the 2010 Iditarod prize purse after learning the race was experiencing financial trouble because a shortage of sponsors. More than 54 teams remained on the Iditarod trail headed toward Nome, including rookie Jamaican musher Newton Marshall, who was in 48th place. Marshall trained with Mackey this season in preparation for his first Iditarod run. Fourteen of the original 71 teams that entered this year's race have scratched en route. A \"Red Lantern\" will be presented to the last place finisher in the dog race, an Alaska tradition dating back to 1953, according to Alaska Magazine.",

        "article": "By . Martyn Ziegler . Germany will wait until the very last minute before deciding whether to withdraw Munich's rival bid against Wembley to stage the final of Euro 2020. The German Football Association (DFB) is also planning a bid to host the entire Euro 2024 tournament and is considering dropping its 2020 bid to boost its chances. DFB president Wolfgang Niersbach has disclosed however that they will wait until the day of the vote on September 19 before deciding whether to pull out of the 2020 race and settle for hosting group games instead. Change of heart? World Cup winner Germany are considering a U-turn on their bid to host Euro 2020 final . Niersbach told German newspaper Die Welt: 'There are 19 cities in the race, and we are very confident that Munich is among the 13 places. We will keep our position until the date of decision. What happens then is open.' 'I can confirm that it is our great ambition for the entire Euro 2024 be played in Germany only,' Niersbach added. 'We need no new stadiums for 2024, that is crucial. The investment that was needed before the 2006 World Cup will not be necessary.' He also dismissed there being a potential conflict of interest with a possible German bid for the summer Olympics in the same year. 'We are very supportive,' Niersbach said: 'There is no competition and we are not competitors.' German engineering: The Allianz Arena in Munich has been touted as a possible venue for the 2020 final . Home of football: England's Wembley Stadium has also bid to hoist the closing stages of the tournament . UEFA is holding Euro 2020 in 13 different countries to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament and only Wembley and Munich's Allianz Arena have put in bids to host the climax of the competition - the semi-finals and final. Football Association general secretary Alex Horne last week expressed confidence in Wembley winning the 2020 bid for Wembley and that the FA will consider a bid to host the entire Euro 2028 tournament.

        "article": "By . Sam Webb . A mysterious beast that has been attacking cattle has been killed on a farm in Belarus, baffling people living nearby and the local vet with its bizarre appearance. This freakish monstrosity, which some cynics might say looks a lot like a normal woodland animal, had been attacking cows and calves by savagely biting their feet, drawing parallels to the Chupacabra of Latin American legend. The vet is at a loss as to what the creature is, claiming two similar creatures have been spotted in the region, but they both managed to evade their pursuers by melting into the forests like supernatural beings. Or small woodland animals, which the body closely resembles. Is this monstrous beast, killed by a Belorussian farmhand, the legendary chupacabra or is there a more pedestrian explanation? We may never know... The region's hunters are also at a loss. Some of them believe it is a mutant amalgam of a number of species because it resembles a hyena, has the features of a fox, a raccoon and a dog, reports\u00a0English Russia. The vet described it as a 'sensation' and vowed to burn the corpse of the killed animal. Presumably in case it comes back to life. But an earlier discovery may be the key to unlocking this mystery. A Ukrainian farmer killed a similar animal last year and gave the body of the animal to biologists. Speculation was rife about the creature, with some claiming that it could be a 'mutant' fox poisoned by radiation, while another theory was that it was a hybrid originating from a secret Soviet plant conducting tests on animals relating to chemical or biological weapons development. A fox mutated by radiation? Or the by-product of a sinister Soviet experiment. No, according to Ukrainian scientists, it's a raccoon dog . The biologists, however, pointed out it was a raccoon dog, which were be bred on Soviet farms in 1939, but were released into the wild when the Second World War started. The Chupacabra is a Latin American monster that attacks livestock, usually goats, and drinks their blood. The name itself is derived from the Spanish 'chupar' ('to suck') and 'cabra' ('goat'). Descriptions of them vary from reptilian with spikes or quills on its back to hairless dogs with fangs and claws. Someone in Piedmont, North Carolina, sent this picture of a mangy dog-like creature into a local TV station with the caption: 'Chupacabra's do exist' Since the legend of the mythical Mexican predator first emerged, there have been 'sightings' of the Chupacabra all over the world. One of these took place earlier this week in Piedmont, North Carolina, after a local spotted a mangy, fox-like creature fitting with the description bestowed on the 'goat-sucker' or 'devil-dog'. A picture was taken by a woman called Ramona who sent it into a local news site with the caption, 'Chupacabras do exist! Scientists have speculated that the creatures could be coyotes infected by parasites after one animal was discovered last July following a fatal attack on livestock. The first reported sighting was in 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood. Their mysterious deaths supposedly spawned the legend of the chupacabra in Latin America. Months later, the creature was allegedly spotted in Can\u00c3\u00b3vanas, where as many as 150 animals had been killed. Since then, there have been attacks allegedly carried out by the creature across South and Central America, and even into New Mexico and Texas.",

        "article": "A Texas family have won a nearly \u00a33 million judgement against an oil giant after claiming that fracking operations near their 40-acre ranch left them suffering severe health side-effects. In what is believed to be the first successful legal action against a shale operator, Bob and Lisa Parr sued Aruba Petroleum for damages for a raft of illness they and their daughter Emma have suffered from for almost six years. They convinced a jury that the company's hydraulic fracturing operations had contaminated their water and land in Decatur leaving them suffering nosebleeds, nausea and rashes. Scroll Down for Video . Victorious: Bob and Lisa Parr with their daughter Emma have won almost $3 million from an energy giant that was fracking for natural gas near to their Texas ranch . Barnett shale: The fields around the Parr's Decatur home are one of the most successful and largest in the United States . 'They\u2019re vindicated,' said David Matthews, a Houston attorney representing the family to the Dallas News. 'It takes guts to say, \u2018I'm going to stand here and protect my family from an invasion of our right to enjoy our property.\u2019 During the trial, Robert Parr testified his family were left unable to drink the water out of their well and Emma would wake up covered in blood sometimes because of terrible nose bleeds. While this is not the first lawsuit against an energy giant, this is the first successful lawsuit that went before a jury. Ill-health: The Parr's kept a detailed record of all the health issues they were suffering including nosebleeds . Most plaintiffs settle beforehand. 'My doctors asked me to start keeping up with what was going on in my area because no one could figure out what was wrong,' said Lisa to MyFoxDFW. Cattle born on the Parr's ranch were also deformed according to the lawsuit. The jury awarded the family $275,000 for lost property value, $2.4 million for past mental anguish,\u00a0 pain and suffering by the couple and their daughter; and $250,000 for future pain and suffering. The lawsuit stated that the Parr's 'experienced almost continual sickness, annoyance, discomfort and inconvenience', due to the fracking operations. The Parr family live nearby the Wise County drilling site that lies upon the Barnett Shale, which is one of the largest natural gas fracking centers in the United States. Severe: Emma would wake up covered in blood because of the nosebleeds she suffered which began in 2008 . 'These are all classic symptoms tied to hydrocarbon exposure,' said Brad Gilde, a Houston attorney who represented the Parrs in the trial to the Dallas News. 'The boom hit the Barnett in 2008 and it just so happened that\u2019s when the Parrs moved onto the ranch. Almost immediately their health effects started to manifest.' In a statement, Aruba Petroleum said it's in compliance with the Texas Railroad Commission and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality. 'We contend the plaintiffs were neither harmed by the presence of our drilling operations nor was the value of their property diminished...Unfortunately, they delivered a verdict that we believe is counter to the evidence provided,' said a spokesperson in a statement for Aruba Petroleum. Relief: The Parr family lived in such miserable conditions that they had to leave their home at one point . Ben Barron, one of the attorneys representing Aruba said that they are in discussions over whether to appeal. 'It was arbitrary,' said Barron, ponting out that there are 100 natural gas wells within 2 miles of the Parr's property - some not operated by Aruba. 'How do you determine which well caused what, if any, damages?' 'The facts of the case and the law as applied to those facts do not support the verdict,' Aruba said in a prepared release. 'Natural gas development has long been prevalent in Wise County with hundreds of wells drilled and currently operated by dozens of companies. Aruba is just one of those operators.'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho is confident that Real Madrid can break Barcelona's dominance in Spain in his first season in charge of the nine-time European champions. The capital club won the last of its 31 La Liga crowns in 2008, but Mourinho exclusively told CNN that he believed he could continue the success that saw him win titles in his native Portugal, England and Italy. \"I hope so. I did it with Porto, I did it with Inter, with Chelsea we didn't win the Champions League but we won two consecutive Premierships so, why not to do it with Real?\" the 47-year-old told CNN World Sport's Patrick Snell. \"It's a big club, it's a club with lots of good players. In this moment they have the motivation because they win nothing in the last years, but of course it's not easy, because we have real opponents, and we have to be the team.\" Mourinho has a big history with Barcelona, where he was an assistant coach under Bobby Robson and then Louis van Gaal from 1996-2000. He had several big European clashes with the Catalan club while in charge of Chelsea, and his Inter side beat Pep Guardiola's titleholders in last season's Champions League semis before going on to defeat Van Gaal's Bayern in the final. \"You know, everybody speaks about our second game in Barcelona where we had a very defensive approach. But they forget in the first match in the Champions League with Inter we smashed them, we scored three goals and we could have scored four or five, so I think the problem with Barcelona is more psychological than other things,\" Mourinho said. \"Lots of teams are afraid of them, they are afraid to attack them. We did it. We won it, and after that in the second leg, it's a semifinal, it's a Champions League semifinal -- it's not the moment to play the beautiful game, it's the moment to make history. Carvalho completes Real Madrid move . \"And we made history, we reached the final, and after that in the final, it was an easy match for us. Bayern was a good team, but we were so solid by a psychological point of view, that Inter did it, and it looked like it was easy, and it wasn't.\" When Mourinho arrived in London in 2004, he famously quipped to the British press that he was \"The Special One\" -- a nickname that has stuck wherever he has gone since. \"But you know, I won lots of things. I won 17 titles in the past 10 years, and I'm one of the three coaches that won two Champions Leagues with two different teams, so, I'm one of the good ones,\" he said. \"But to say I'm the Special One, I prefer not to say that, I just say 'I have a nice system'.\" Mourinho will have to juggle a star-studded squad which has failed to equal the sum of its parts in the past two seasons, with Real's opening match away to Mallorca on August 29. Injury blow for Real star Kaka . He has brought in internationals such as Angel Di Maria and Ricardo Carvalho, but will be without Kaka for up to four months after the Brazil playmaker need knee surgery on his return from the World Cup in South Africa. \"We all know that the knee was a real problem, and after that the problem he has in the groin will be solved when the knee problem is solved,\" Mourinho said. \"And now we know until December-January we don't have him, so we have to prepare the team, organize the team without Kaka. But he will be back, and he will be back at 100 percent, and at 100 percent he's one of the best and we need him.\" Cristiano Ronaldo almost single-handedly kept Real in the Spanish title race last season with his goals and inspirational performances, and Mourinho said he was looking forward to working with his compatriot -- the most expensive player in the world. \"He's fantastic, and the way he works speaks for itself. He's a boy that works very, very hard every day -- lots of ambition, he wants to improve all the time,\" Mourinho said. \"So with the potential he has, I just hope he keeps going. Because I cannot demand more than he's giving.\" While Real spent $350 million on Ronaldo and other players this time last year, one position that has never been in doubt is that of goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who captained Spain to a historic first World Cup title last month. He joined \"Los Merengues\" as a nine-year-old in 1990, and will this season pass 400 first-team appearances. \"I believe in this club -- I'm lucky to be Madrid born and bred,\" Casillas told CNN. \"To live in the city, to play for the club, this is home for me. It would be hard to ever consider leaving this club. It has helped shape me, it's developed me as a person on so many levels since I was so young.\" While Real's expensive squad has a reputation of being a group of talented individuals who struggle to gel, Casillas said the players were focused on ending Barcelona's run of two consecutive titles. \"We're all unified as one. We're hard-working, humble people. People who fight hard, willing to struggle for the cause. Whether it's Cristiano, Kaka, Casillas, Canales -- we're all in it together, and that's what's important\" Casillas said Spain's long-awaited success was a dream come true for his generation of players. \"What it means is so significant. We succeeded in realizing a dream we all had since we were young kids. All footballers have a dream to win the World Cup for their country and I as a youngster was no different,\" he said. \"Look at who we were up against. Maradona's Argentina, Germany, Italy, France and Brazil. We had to succeed against all of them! Did we ever really think we would do it given all the bad luck we'd had in the past? But look in the end, we were successful!\"",

Motorola announced its plans for a modular phone in October \u2013 now it has revealed that core parts for the phone will be 3D-printed. Called Project Ara, it\u2019s a phone that users will be able to customise in the same way that you can with Lego. The parts could be a battery, a keyboard, the display \u2013 or a component that hasn\u2019t even been invented yet. Good call: Motorola's Project Ara is a mobile phone that customers will be able to build themselves . To make the parts for it, Motorola has turned to the company that made the first 3D printer 20 years ago \u2013 South Carolina-based 3D Systems. The partnership certainly has an appealing symmetry, as Motorola invented the handheld mobile phone, back in 1973. However, the Project Ara 3D-printing concept is so cutting-edge that the technology hasn\u2019t even been perfected yet. Regina Dugan, Senior Vice President and head of Motorola\u2019s Advanced Technology and Projects group, said: \u2018It requires technical advances in areas such as material strength and printing with conductive inks for antennas. Rudy Krolopp, former Motorola Design chief and designer of the world's first mobile phone, holding his invention (left) \u2018And those advances must support production-level speeds and volumes, which is a natural partnership with 3D Systems.\u2019 Avi Reichental, President and CEO of 3D Systems, said: 'Project Ara was conceived to build a platform that empowers consumers all over the world with customization for a product made by and for the individual. '3D printing promotes a level of sustainability, functionality, and mass personalisation that turns these kinds of global ambitions into attainable local realities.'",

        "article": "By . Wills Robinson . David McCormack, 63, failed two breath tests within hours of each other after he was stopped by police in South Shields, Tyne and Wear . A man caught drink driving was arrested for the same offence just hours later after he returned to a police station to collect his belongings - still drunk from the night before. Daniel McCormack, 63, was stopped in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, after officers were alerted to his \u2018erratic driving\u2019 and pulled him over. He recorded a reading of 372 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 milliletres of blood - more than four times the legal limit. After being released from South Shields Police Station, he drove back the next morning to collect his possessions where suspicious officers performed another breath test. The reading revealed McCormack was more than two times over the limit, and he was arrested again. He was banned from the roads for three years after he admitted two counts of driving with excess alcohol at South Tyneside Magistrates Court. Sarah Guest, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen by police driving erratically. They see the vehicle and ask the driver to stop. 'Another vehicle stops behind, and says he has been driving like that for a while. 'The following day, a police officer on duty at South Shields Police Station saw the defendant in the station, and noted he smelt strongly of alcohol. 'He was seen getting into his Ford Focus car in the car and drove at a slow speed. He was stopped at that point and given a roadside breath test. Mccormack, from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, was given a 12 week jail sentence - suspended for 12 months - and was banned from driving for three years. He was also ordered to pay costs of \u00a330 following the event at 10.25am on Saturday, March 29. Carole Whittingham, Secretary of the Campaign Against Drinking And Driving, says she is unsure What it will take\u2019 for magistrates to exercise their powers to jail drink drivers. She said: 'This is a very high reading. Anybody who is over the drink and drive limit is a danger. 'What do you have to do for magistrates to use their power to jail offenders for up to six months?' He was released from the cells at South Shields Police Station in Tyne and Wear - but drove back a short time later to pick up his belongings and was arrested again by a suspicious police officer .",

        "article": "By . Kieran Corcoran . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 23 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:34 EST, 23 December 2013 . Cleared: Detective constable Gary Quigley was acquitted of administering a poison or noxious substance with intent at Southwark Crown Court . A policeman who filled a Powerade bottle with screenwash as a practical joke - only for it to be drunk by an unsuspecting colleague - has been cleared of poisoning him. Detective Constable Gary Quigley, who works in the Child Protection division of the Metropolitan Police, said he was 'fed up' with his drink getting stolen from a communal fridge. So, in what he later described as 'a poorly-planed practical joke', he filled up a 500ml bottle of the berry and tropical-flavoured drink with screenwash, hoping to identify the culprit and 'teach him a lesson'. But his colleague, DC Steve Halfhide, who also drank Powerade and stored it in the same fridge, accidentally drank from the bottle of screenwash. After swallowing two mouthfuls of the drink, he felt a burning pain in his throat and vomited several times. DC Halfhide was advised to go to hospital but luckily he was not seriously hurt after drinking the toxic liquid on 29 January last year. Quigley was arrested and charged for attempting to poison his colleague with intent. But he insisted that his sole intention was to catch the thief, and not to cause any harm, which led to him being cleared of the charge today at Southwark Crown Court. He had originally admitted the office, but changed his plea and managed to convince a jury of seven men and five women that he is an innocent man. Wearing a dark jacket over a white casual shirt, Quigley, smiled to relatives in the public gallery when the verdict was announced. The court heard that Quigley bought the Powerade while he was training for a half-marathon. The pair were based at police offices in Cam Road, Straford, but did not know each other, said prosecutor Joceyln Ledward. He said: \u2018The defendant replaced the blue Powerade drink in a sports-style drinking bottle with screenwash and put it back in the communal fridge in the office he worked. \u2018He says his motive in doing so was the belief the drink was his, and that the person who had been stealing his drinks would be taught a lesson. \u2018In fact, his colleague, Steve Halfhide, had the misfortune also to be a drinker of Powerade, and to have stored his own Powerade drinks in the fridge. Victim: DC Steve Halfhide, left, was also a Powerade drinker who used the communal fridge, and accidentally drank from the screenwash bottle, which caused burning pain and vomiting . \u2018When he drank from the Powerade in question, he swallowed a mouthful or two of screenwash before experienced the very unpleasant consequences.\u2019 Ms Ledward added: \u2018Whether this drink was in fact DC Halfhide\u2019s, or whether he thought it was, or even if he was stealing DC Quigley\u2019s drink is irrelevant. \u2018This was a dangerous and completely disproportionate thing to do in the circumstances. \u2018By deliberately disguising the blue screen wash in a Powerade bottle and placing it, unlabelled, in the communal fridge, the defendant clearly intended that someone should drink from it or at least must have forseen that someone might - that was precisely his purpose.\u2019 Quigley, from Colchester, Essex, claimed there was a \u2018culture of humour\u2019 at his office where officers would play pranks on each other. He said colleagues were aware of the Powerade being spiked with screen wash, and had suggested alternatives including Fairy Liquid and even urine. Ms Ledward said this was merely Quigley \u2018trying to deflect attention from his own wrong doing.\u2019 In a prepared statement he said: \u2018I admit fully and accept all culpability for my actions. \u2018I am extremely sorry and deeply remorseful for what has happened. It was never my intention to cause any injury to anyone. \u2018However, I do accept that my actions were likely to cause grievance or annoyance.\u2019",

        "article": "(EW) -- Looks like the mercurial Jay Gatsby will remain mysteriously out of reach for a bit longer. Warner Bros. announced today that \"The Great Gatsby,\" director Baz Luhrmann's 3-D adaptation of the seminal novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has been pushed to Summer 2013. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role, along with Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton, the film had been slated to open on Christmas day this year. No specific new date was indicated. In announcing the change, Warner Bros. president of distribution Dan Fellman lauded Luhrmann's singular visual style. \"We think moviegoers of all ages are going to embrace it, and it makes sense to ensure this unique film reaches the largest audience possible,\" he said in a statement. International distribution chief Veronika Kwan Vanderberg added that the studio believes \"The Great Gatsby\" \"will be the perfect summer movie around the world.\" The film would have gone head to head with Quentin Tarantino's \"Django Unchained,\" which also stars DiCaprio in a supporting role as the cruel owner of a plantation in the pre-Civil War south.

Linda Jackson, 55, head of Citroen in the UK and Ireland since 2010, will take the driver's seat at the 95-year-old company from current chief Frederic Banzet on June 1. The Warwick University graduate has more than 35 years experience in the motor industry, but is just the third woman to ever head up a major car maker. In the driver's seat: Linda Jackson, the new chief executive of Citroen, takes over the company on June 1 . Ms Jackson has presided over a 6 per . cent rise in sales in her region in the past year alone, successfully . moving the company away from a discounting culture and unprofitable . fleet deals. She told . Autocar that she believes having her 'Anglo Saxon, British way of doing . things will be a good thing in a diverse French company.' Outlining . her strategy to Auto Express, she said: 'We want to be more creative, . affordable and offer things that really matter to mainstream customers . 'We . want to be innovative in design \u2013 we\u2019ve been good at that in the past . and new models like the C4 Picasso have shown that again. 'We want our cars to have useful technology like our touch screens that are easy to use and the air bumps on the C4 Cactus.' Citroen is well known for its creativity, with its iconic but odd-looking 2CV one of the most successful cars of the 20th century and hailed for the quality of its engineering. Cult status: Citroen 2CV owners arrive for the 16th World Meeting of 2CV Friends in the Scottish town of Kelso . Ms . Jackson is taking the the wheel at Citroen at a difficult time, with . parent company PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-biggest carmaker, . struggling to stem losses in most of its traditional markets. Outgoing . chief Mr Banzet is a member of the Peugeot family, which is . reducing its stake so the company can accept a \u20ac3billion cash injection . from the French government and China's Dongfeng Motor Group. France, . Dongfeng and the Peugeot family will each hold a 14 per cent stake in . the company, with the hope that the Chinese connection will help drive . higher sales in the country, now the world's biggest car market. Iconic: French president Charles de Gaulle drives through Algeria, then a French colony, in a Citroen . The . reshuffle comes just over a month after Carlos Tavares, a former . Renault executive, took over from former Peugeot CEO Philippe Varin. Strategy . director Yves Bonnefont, who currently doubles as deputy head of . Citroen, will lead the premium DS marque as it separates from Citroen . under a recovery plan unveiled by Mr Tavares last month. Ms Jackson and Ms Bonnefont will sit on the group's executive committee along with Peugeot brand chief Maxime Picat.",

This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports\u00a0The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m. Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop . While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off. The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck. The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home. Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting . The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident. The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA. While two police detain his female friend, another can be heard shouting: 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' Five gun shots are then fired and the man lies lifeless, face down.",

Writing under the hashtag \u2018#davekeepsitreal\u2019, users poked fun at Mr Cameron\u2019s wealth and \u2018toff\u2019 background. 'Margo' wrote that Dave should 'keep it real' by \u2018sending a 'friend' request to John Prescott on Facebook!\u2019 Mr Prescott, who started the hashtag, posted that the Prime Minister should \u2018eat . caviar straight out of the tin\u2019 and start \u2018hanging out with northern . MPs\u2026like Nick Clegg.\u2019 User . David Townsend teased Mr Cameron for his recent claim that he shopped in . Sainsbury\u2019s. Mocking the Witney MP he wrote: \u2018I\u2019m not a snob. My butler . has shopped at Tesco.\u2019 Crumbling: David Cameron has come under fire for 'pastygate' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in Leeds that doesn't exist . On the same theme Teacherdude commented: \u2018His favourite song is the Hollies. \u2018He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Butler.\u2019 \u2018The Hughes\u2019 said the Prime Minister could regain public confidence by \u2018paying for Special Brew on his platinum card.\u2019 Mr Cameron has refuted suggestions that he is not in touch with the public and sticks by his famous \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 slogan. However, ministers have recently been criticised over the way they dealt with the fuel strike threat and the handling of Abu Qatada's attempted deportation. Satirical comments about Mr Cameron from Twitter users continued to flood into the site throughout the day. Crumbling: David Cameron has come under fire for 'pastygate' when he claimed to have eaten a pasty from a branch in Leeds that doesn't exist . Chris Orton said the leader should keep it real by \u2018visiting the city of Cambridge to see how the other half live in the north.\u2019 Cameron Addicott said that DC could be 'down with the kids' by announcing that his favourite rappers are NWA \u2013 'Nannies With Attitude.' Duncan Jefferies said the Prime Minister should refer to \u2018guns as shooters\u2019 when flogging arms to dodgy regimes.\u2019 The comments comes in the wake of David Cameron's announcement yesterday that he wanted to \u2018stay in touch\u2019 with voters as he brushed aside claims that he was an \u2018arrogant posh boy\u2019. After a turbulent month he vowed to \u2018learn some important lessons\u2019 but his fightback was marred by an extraordinary attack on him and George Osborne by Tory MP Nadine Dorries who branded them \u2018arrogant posh boys\u2019 who \u2018don\u2019t know the price of milk\u2019. In a separate blow to the Tories, a poll showed Mr Cameron\u2019s three-point lead a month ago has been replaced by an eight-point lead for Labour. Mrs Dorries told the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics show: \u2018There is a very tight narrow clique of a certain group of people and what they do is act as a barrier and prevent Cameron and Osborne and others from actually really understanding or knowing what is happening in the rest of the country. \u2018I think that not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don\u2019t know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others \u2013 and that is their real crime.\u2019 Mr Cameron sighed when Mrs Dorries\u2019 remarks were read to him later. \u2018Look, I don\u2019t agree with Nadine. She\u2019s . got a very strong view about a number of things, he said. \u2018I go to . Sainsbury\u2019s in Chipping Norton on a Friday or a Saturday. I do a lot of . the family shopping. Sam does a lot of it on the internet.\u2019 Asked about the price of a pint of milk, he said: \u2018I pay just under 50p.\u2019 But in his most frank assessment of . the Government\u2019s recent performance, the Prime Minister admitted: \u2018There . isn\u2019t a day in this job that I don\u2019t learn some important lessons and . you\u2019ve got to make sure you stay in touch and realise that as you get on . with it.\u2019 David Cameron will try to avoid close dealings with tax-dodging businessmen in future, he pledged yesterday. The Prime Minister, whose party has been accused of being too close to the rich, said the Government was cracking down on individuals and businesses carrying out \u2018aggressive tax avoidance\u2019. When asked if he would try to avoid dealing with tax dodgers, he told the BBC: \u2018Generally speaking, yes, I think that\u2019s sensible.\u2019 But he refused to comment on Sir Philip Green\u2019s tax affairs \u2013 the billionaire retailer who was a Government efficiency adviser. Critics accuse Sir Philip of avoiding millions of pounds of tax by registering most of his business in the name of his wife Tina, who lives in Monaco. Mr Cameron said: \u2018He came up with very sensible suggestions for how you could reduce costs in government and therefore reduce people\u2019s tax liabilities.\u2019 He suggested poor communication was to . blame for many of the Coalition\u2019s recent difficulties \u2013 citing the fuel . strike, when ministers were accused of helping to trigger panic buying. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude called for voters to fill jerry cans with petrol and keep them in their garages. \u2018Sometimes a presentational mistake . can be an important mistake,\u2019 said Mr Cameron. \u2018On the fuel strike issue . ...we have taken very effective action ... but did we communicate . perfectly at every stage? I think most people would say, \u201cNo you . didn\u2019t\u201d.\u2019 Asked if he would apologise for the . Government\u2019s role in causing chaos at the pumps, the Prime Minister . said: \u2018The Government took the right action in terms of the resilience . of the country but we need to do better in terms of communication.\u2019 Pressed again on whether he was sorry, he added: \u2018Of course. Look, I\u2019m . responsible in the end for everything the Government does, and if we . don\u2019t get it right I\u2019m very clear about that.\u2019 In a separate interview, part of a . round attempting to draw a line under recent difficulties before local . elections next month, Mr Cameron conceded his Government must \u2018raise our . game\u2019. 'Raise the game': Mr Cameron conceded yesterday that the Government must do better as a poll put Labour support at a nine-year high of 41 per cent . \u2018Everything we are doing is about . helping people who work hard and do the right thing and making this . country more pro-enterprise, more pro-get-up-and-go, more pro-work, more . pro-effort. The Prime Minister yesterday defended finding the time to have \u2018date nights\u2019 with wife Samantha and watch DVD box sets. Mr Cameron said he was \u2018absolutely driven\u2019 in his job, but insisted it was right to find time for his family. As polls show that support for the Conservatives is plummeting, some backbench Tory MPs have said Mr Cameron is too relaxed for his role. One Tory backbencher told the Financial Times that Mr Cameron was \u2018putting the school run ahead of the national interest\u2019. But Mr Cameron said that Prime Ministers who do not take time out from their jobs end up \u2018completely fried and exhausted\u2019 and make \u2018bad judgements\u2019. \u2018That is the mission. You have difficult weeks or difficult months. I want us to raise our game and do better,\u2019 he said. The Prime Minister dismissed claims . that he is too relaxed. \u2018I may look relaxed but I don\u2019t ever feel . particularly relaxed in this job,\u2019 he said. However, a committee of MPs . will today give voice to criticism of Mr Cameron\u2019s leadership style in a . report blaming a lack of strategic thinking for a series of policy . mistakes. \u2018Policy decisions are made for . short-term reasons, little reflecting the longer-term interests of the . nation,\u2019 MPs on the commons public administration select committee will . say. Former Cabinet Secretary Lord . O\u2019Donnell, meanwhile, launched an extraordinary attack on ministers\u2019 attempts to blame civil servants for some of their woes. \u2018It doesn\u2019t usually work, and I don\u2019t think it will work this time either,\u2019 he said. He also defended the right of Treasury . officials to offer potential tax changes to an number of different . administrations, following claims the \u2018pasty tax\u2019 and \u2018granny tax\u2019 \u2013 had . been rejected by previous Chancellors and \u2018taken off a shelf\u2019. \u2018Just because one political party . doesn\u2019t think something is a good idea doesn\u2019t mean that a different . form of government might decide that they\u2019ve got different political . priorities and might want to go with it,\u2019 he said.Last night\u2019s ICM . survey for the Guardian revealed support for Labour has reached its . highest level for nine years. Ed Miliband\u2019s party has seen its poll . rating rise by four points in the past month to 41 per cent, a figure . last enjoyed by Labour during Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s ill-fated leadership . of the Tories. Labour\u2019s fortunes have risen as support for the Tories has fallen by six points to 33 per cent. Mr Cameron\u2019s three-point lead a month ago has been replaced by an eight-point lead for Mr Miliband. Liberal Democrat support is unchanged on 15 per cent.",

A woman who set up sham weddings between European women and African migrants so they could stay in Britain has been jailed. Ana Rita Teixeira Ferras, 26, set up at least three fake marriage in 2012 between women from the EU and men from west Africa. She even took part in a scam herself and married a man in 2007 and helped produce false payslips to be used by those who had had sham marriages when they made applications to the Home Office to stay in the country. Ferras even fled back to her home country of Portugal when police caught up with her at her home in Highbrook, Northamptonshire, and was only brought back to the UK after a European Arrest Warrant was issued. During a hearing at at Northampton Crown Court Ferras\u00a0admitted four counts of facilitating a breach of immigration law. She was jailed for four years and three months. Several accomplices in the ring have previously been convicted for their part of the scheme as part of a Home Office investigation called Operation Marco. Jessica Nunes, 21, from Corby, Northamptonshire, was handed a 12 month suspended sentence in April 2013. Nunes, a student, married a man called Oluwasegun Omoniyi, also a student in another fake wedding. He too was jailed for 44 weeks for his part in the plot after pleading guilty to attempting to obtain leave to remain in the UK by deception. Samantha McDonald, 26, from Corby, was handed a 14 month suspended sentence in November 2013 after pleading guilty to one count of facilitating a breach of immigration law. Speaking after Ferras's conviction, Andy Radcliffe, Home Office Criminal Investigations Officer, said: 'Ferris thought she could abuse and manipulate the immigration system to her own criminal ends. 'She was wrong and is now behind bars. 'The use of the European Arrest Warrant was vital to being able to return Ferris to the UK and bring this investigation to a successful conclusion. Ferras was jailed for four years and three months after at a hearing at Northampton Crown Court she pleaded guilty to four charges of facilitating a breach of immigration law for organising sham marriages . 'Thanks to this, and the dedication and meticulous hard work of the Home Office Criminal Investigation team she has now been brought to justice.' Last month ringleaders of a different sham marriage gang which arranged fake weddings for foreign men who wanted to gain British citizenship were jailed.\u00a0Ibrahim Mahter, 29, and Abdulgani Makrani, 66, organised at least seven fake marriages for men from Pakistan and India, offering women up to \u00a38,000 to take a foreign husband. Mahter was jailed for four years and Makrani for three and a half years after they were convicted of conspiracy to facilitate a breach of UK immigration law, between November 2005 and October 2012.",

        "article": "By . Louise Boyle and Thomas Durante . PUBLISHED: . 00:49 EST, 6 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 7 December 2012 . A father who launched a transatlantic custody battle against his estranged wife over their daughter has accused his former partner of drunkenness and domestic violence. U.S. Army Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin is reportedly 'deeply concerned' about Lynn Hales' abilities as a mother. The bitter custody dispute is over the couple's five-year-old daughter Eris. When the couple split up in 2010, Ms Hales, a Scottish native, sued for custody and took the girl back to Scotland from Alabama. The Supreme Court is now considering whether an American court can have any further say in the international custody dispute. A decision is expected to be made in the next few months. Sgt Chafin this week questioned Ms Hales fitness as a parent. He said she was arrested on . Christmas Eve 2010 for threatening him with a knife as their marriage broke down, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Hales denies . these claims. She was also arrested earlier in December 2010 for being drunk in public and reportedly fighting with a taxi driver in the U.S. but was never charged. Sgt Chafin's lawyer\u00a0Michael E. Manely told MailOnline today that he expected a swift decision on the case and believed that the Supreme Court would find in favor of his client. Mr Manely said his client, who remains on active service with the U.S. Army, wants his daughter to be returned to America. Mr Manely described the Chafins, who have a divorce case pending in Alabama, as having a 'love-hate' relationship. However he added that they seemed intent on working out custody arrangements for their daughter. Custody fight: The Supreme Court is trying to determine whether Sgt Jeffrey Lee Chafin, can appeal a federal judge's decision to let his estranged wife take their daughter Eris back to her native Scotland . Mother: A lawyer for Lynne Hales Chafin, pictured, argues that the Supreme Court no longer has jurisdiction . Sgt Chafin and Ms Hales, of Muirhead, . Lanarkshire, got married in Germany in 2006 and their daughter was born . there the following year. The . family resided in Germany before Sgt Chafin, 42, was deployed to . Afghanistan. Mother and daughter returned to her family in Scotland. In . 2009, Sgt Chafin was posted to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama and was joined . by 35-year-old Mrs Chafin and Eris where they began to build a life . together. However over the next year, the relationship broke down. Hales was deported back to Scotland in 2011 for overstaying her tourist visa. She . sued to take their five-year-old daughter Eris with her, citing the 1980 Hague convention on . international child abductions. The . convention is designed to return children . illegally taken from member countries. She said their daughter's . residence was Scotland and that her husband illegally retained the child . in the United States. A . federal judge agreed and allowed the girl be taken to Scotland. The . judge also refused to allow an appeal. Sgt . Chafin then took the case to the circuit court, which said the case could not be considered because the child's official residence is in Scotland. Now in the Supreme Court, judges are trying to . determine whether Sgt Chafin can appeal a federal judge's decision to . let Lynne Hales Chafin take Eris to Scotland. The . 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Sgt Chafin's appeal was . moot because the girl has now been in Scotland for more than a year, and . that his only remedy is in the Scottish courts. Firing back: Hales has argued that their daughter's residence was Scotland . Justice . Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Sgt Chafin's lawyer . that the point of the Hague Convention was to stop the shuttling of . children from country to country during custody disputes. She . said: 'What you're urging is exactly what this Convention was meant to . stop. 'This child has been in Scotland for 14 months. Now, you say bring . it back to the United States, and we start over. 'The whole object of the return procedure is so that you get the child to a place that's a proper place to determine custody.' But several judges seemed concerned by the idea that a foreign-born parent could escape U.S. court jurisdiction by leaving the country. Chief Justice John Roberts said the situation would encourage such parents in custody disputes 'to leave immediately' following a favorable decision, even though it is not a final decision in U.S. courts. Roberts said that was a parent flees 'it is all over', calling the situation a 'very unfortunate result'. Lynne Chafin's lawyer Stephen Cullen said if a child has left America on an international flight the jurisdiction of the U.S. court system is over. 'There can be no re-return' order from the U.S. courts, Mr Cullen said, adding that Sgt Chafin can plead his case in Scottish courts. Fight: Sgt Chafin, pictured with young Eris, may have to plead his case in Scotland .",

        "article": "The son of Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour was jailed yesterday after showing the \u2018ultimate disrespect\u2019 to Britain\u2019s war dead by swinging from the Cenotaph during the student riots. Charlie Gilmour, 21, reeled in shock as he was handed a 16-month sentence for his \u2018outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour\u2019 during a drug-fuelled rampage that also saw him attack Prince Charles\u2019s car. The Cambridge University history student was \u2018out of his mind\u2019 on a cocktail of LSD, Valium and whisky when he laid siege to the royal convoy during the tuition fee protests in London on December 9 last year. Not happy, Gilmour: Charlie Gilmour, left, who was jailed yesterday for 16 months, arrives at court with his father, Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour and his mother Polly Samson (rear, centre) He threw a bin at a car carrying . royal protection officers and leapt on the bonnet of the vehicle . escorting the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal . Variety Performance. Gilmour, whose parents have a home in . London as well as a \u00a32.68million seafront mansion in Hove, East Sussex, . was also part of a mob who ransacked TopShop\u2019s flagship Oxford Street . store, causing \u00a350,000 worth of damage. Yesterday the yob tried to excuse his . behaviour, saying that he had not known it was the Cenotaph. But Judge . Nicholas Price scoffed at the excuse, saying: \u2018For you, a young man of . undoubted high intelligence, education and background, to profess you . didn\u2019t know what the Cenotaph represented defies belief. Under attack: The Rolls-Royce of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was attacked during the protests . Jailed: Charlie Gilmour outside Kingston Crown Court during a break in proceedings . \u2018It\u2019s through the deaths of those . many thousands who gave their lives that you have been given the . opportunity for the democratic right to protest, but you showed ultimate . disrespect to those who fell defending their country. \u2018Such outrageous and deeply offensive behaviour gives a clear indication of how out of control you were that day.\u2019 The judge told how Gilmour\u2019s conduct . had prompted a deluge of \u2018vituperative and in many cases obscene\u2019 hate . mail sent to his blameless family. However, he accepted that\u00a0 Gilmour . had shown contrition the day after his actions, and stressed that his . antics at the Cenotaph did not form part of the violent disorder charge. But sentencing him at Kingston Crown . Court, Surrey, he said: \u2018I have to take into account that you have had . many advantages which are denied to most young men who come before this . court. \u2018I have no doubt you felt strongly . about the legislation regarding student fees, but what you did went far, . far beyond proper protest.\u2019 Gilmour was wide-eyed in shock as he . was led away by a prison officer, while his mother, writer Polly Samson, . sobbed.Later, she and her rock star husband, who is worth an estimated . \u00a378million, hugged their son\u2019s university friends, many of whom shook . with emotion. During the hearing, Gilmour\u2019s lawyer . wheeled out no fewer than 13 character references, many from \u2018very . distinguished\u2019 members of society, including BBC boss Alan Yentob and . the chief executive of the homeless charity Crisis. David Spens, QC, defending, said . Gilmour, an ex-pupil at \u00a39,000-a-term Lancing College in West Sussex, . was a \u2018gentle\u2019 student who had been subjected to \u2018serious bullying\u2019 in . the past. He said the second-year student \u2013 who . was adopted by Dave Gilmour \u2013 had been catapulted into a downward . spiral of drink and drugs by a disastrous meeting last year with his . biological father, the radical playwright and poet Heathcote Williams. Mr Spens said: \u2018For a period of time . starting around August 2010 he was, by his own admission, on something . of a continual binge, taking a range of illicit and illegal drugs. In . his own words, he spent most of the week, effectively every week, . tranquillised out of his mind. Going home alone: David Gilmour and his wife Polly Samson leave Kingston Crown Court following the sentencing of their son Charlie . Close family: Charlie Gilmour, right, pictured here as his father is awarded a CBE by the Queen in 2003, was given 16 months behind bars today. Here he is pictured with his father, mother Polly, and sister Alice (left) \u2018This young man has had to cope with . the pain and considerable emotional upheaval of having a biological . father who rejected him for no good reason and has continued to reject . him throughout his life.\u2019 Mr Spens said Gilmour had now sought help from a psychotherapist, had stopped using drugs and cut down his drinking. Gilmour admitted violent disorder at a hearing in May, but denied he was responsible for the bin attack. A spokesman for Girton College, . Cambridge, said he could not comment on whether Gilmour would be allowed . to return to finish his course.

Prefers the warmth: Robert Vick walked away from a 6-year prison sentence on Sunday and only spent one night on the outside before turning himself in Monday after temperatures in Lexington, Kentucky plummeted . An inmate who escaped from a Kentucky prison on Sunday spent just one night on the outside before turning himself in because he was so cold. Wind chills plunged the temperature in Lexington to 20 below zero after Robert Vick, 42, walked away from a six-year sentence at the minimum security Blackburn Correctional Complex on Sunday. When he came running back on Monday it was with frostbite and a burning desire to get out of the arctic cold. Before he turned himself in, Vick first tried to seek help at a motel not far from the prison. He happened to knock on Victoria Fugate's door at the Sunset Motel. 'He was hungry. The dude knocked on our door, we gave him a ham and cheese sandwich, we gave him some hot chocolate,' Fugate told Lex18.com. Vick apparently spent the night in a nearby abandoned farmhouse, where life on the outside proved to be too much. 'The next thing you know,' Fugate said, 'they are arresting him, he's frostbit.' Scroll down for video... Chill reception: Vicks escaped from the minimum security Blackburn Correctional Facility, where he was serving 6 years for burglary, but got a chill reception on the outside . 'He was pitiful': Vick wandered to this motel, where guest Victoria Fugate took pity on him and offered him a ham sandwich . 'I thought he was crazy': Vick spent just one night as a free man and after holing up in an abandoned farmhouse overnight he returned to the motel, where he asked manager Maurice King to 'call the law' on him . He has a point: Along with much of the US, Kentucky was pummeled by some of the coldest temperatures in decades starting Monday . On Monday, after just one night of freedom, Fugate strode into the office of Sunset Motel manager Maurice King begging for a favor. 'He said \"Can you call the law on me?\" And I looked at him, I thought he was crazy or something,' King said. 'He was ready to go back,' Maurice laughed. Authorities arrived with an ambulance and took the frostbitten convict to the University of Kentucky for treatment. Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lisa Lamb says Vick would have been dressed in prison-issued khaki pants, a shirt and a jacket when he escaped. He was returned to the Blackburn Correctional Facility by Monday night. Nabbed: Police arrived to the Sunset Motel on Monday with an ambulance and transported the frostbitten man to a hospital. He was back at the Blackburn Correctional Facility by Monday night .",

        "article": "By . Candace Sutton For Daily Mail Australia . The apartment where Warriena Tagpuno Wright spent the last hours of her life lies just off the Gold Coast's most famous boulevard, Cavill Avenue, in Surfers Paradise. The two-bedroom flat decorated in neutral tones, and marble and granite finishes has floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the balcony from which Ms Wright, 26, fell to her death at 2.20am on Friday, August 8. Queensland police will allege Ms Wright and 28-year-old Gold Coast construction worker, Gable Tostee, were alone in the apartment on the night of her death. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee, 28, was arrested at his parents' home on Friday morning for the murder of Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26 . Warriena Tagpuno Wright died when she plunged 14 storeys to her death at Avalon Riverfront Apartments at Surfers Paradise in Queensland . Tostee was remanded in custody until October 10 for the murder of Ms Wright. His lawyer, Michael Purcell, says Tostee maintains he is not guilty of the murder and will be applying for bail. 'My client maintains his innocence and we look forward to the provision of a brief of evidence so we can move on with the court process,' he said. 'I've got instructions to make an application to the Supreme Court for bail in the weeks to come.' Tostee's family were not present in court. Police will allege they have a compelling case against Tostee, including taped recordings of the interactions between him and Ms Wright around the time of her death. Gold Coast regional crime squad commander, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson, said there were two people in the apartment prior to Ms Wright's fall - 'Mr Tostee and Warriena'. Gable Tostee lived in a luxury apartment that overlooked the beach and Nerang River . Inside the apartment, its marble bathroom has a glass shower and bathtub, and marble-top surfaces with a basin . Ms Wright, a New Zealand bank worker, went to Mr Tostee's apartment after meeting him on the dating app Tinder near the end of a trip to the Gold Coast for a friend's wedding. Tostee's apartment is in Avalon Riverfront Apartments, an ultra-modern 32-storey riverside block in the heart of Surfers Paradise. The building lies between Cavill Avenue and the Nerang River, and is just a 500m walk from the night club and bar strip on Orchid Avenue frequented by Tostee. Avalon's apartments feature views of the river, city skyline and ocean off the south-east Queensland coast. Residents have access to a gym and sauna, and the penthouse flat has a private roof garden. Ms Wright would have entered the building through a sleek designer foyer and taken the lift to the 14th-floor flat, which is around 45m above street level. Avalon Riverfront Apartments building is an ultra-modern 32-storey riverside block in the heart of Surfers Paradise . It features a glossy grey galley kitchen with composite marble bench tops looks onto the large living room . It is just a 500m walk from the night club and bar strip on Orchid Avenue frequented by Gable Tostee . Gable Tostee's unit features clean painted white walls, a marble bathroom with glass shower unit and a bathtub and plain grey-beige carpet throughout. A glossy grey galley kitchen with composite marble bench tops looks onto the large living room, which has floor-to-ceiling windows along the balcony. It was from this balcony, which looks out over Surfers Paradise and the Nerang River, that Ms Wright fell. A passer-by found her body on the cement path below, which has now become a shrine to the young woman with flowers, notes and stuffed toys. Neighbours have told police they heard three distinct screams 'and a bang' as Ms Wright fell to her death. Gable Tostee defence lawyer Michael Purcell speaks to reporters at Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning . Tostee was escorted to the Gold Coast watch house by detectives in black suits . Detectives revisit the balcony on Wednesday from which Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death . Mr Tostee has been arrested following the death of a female tourist who fell from his apartment balcony at the Gold Coast on Friday . Tostee did not appear in Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday morning - the day after he was charged with the murder of Ms Wright - and Magistrate John Costanzo adjourned Tostee's matter until October 10. In the week leading up to Tostee's arrest, detectives kept his flat as a crime scene during the week while they made extensive forensic examinations of the unit. On Wednesday, police in a cherry picker were raised up the Avalon building to take forensic samples from the outside of the balcony and other apartments on the way down. Days later, detectives arrested Tostee at his parents' Carrara home on the Gold Coast and took him to the Southport watchhouse, where he charged with the murder of Ms Wright - exactly a week after she plummeted to her death. Ms Wright had travelled from her native New Zealand for a two-week holiday and attend a former work colleague's wedding. Reza Tagpuno (left) fronted media and made the impassioned plea for more information about her sister Warriena Wright's death on Thursday . The 23-year-old described her sister (pictured) as an animal lover and the 'most important person' in her life . She remembered her sister as a jokester - who played pranks on her - and looked after her . Reza, 13, said her sister was her 'best friend' and she wants to know what happened to her . Reza broke down as she said: 'It's hard for me facing the loss of my sister without knowing what happened in the last hours of her life' Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Gable Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex .

The two-year-old was unable to walk but has strengthened her legs using a special bicycle and has progressed to take steps. Readers raised \u00a355,000 for Sophie after she was denied NHS funding for surgery to help her walk at the same trust which paid for aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham's breast enlargement operation. Scroll down for video . Proud smile: Sophie Thomlinson is now able to stand on her own thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers . Readers' funds enabled Sophie's family to buy the specially-adapted \u00a31,200 bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of the procedure, which they hope she will have in the US when she turns three next year. While Sophie posed for pictures for the Mail, she suddenly stood up without help for the first time \u2013 causing her mother to burst into tears. 'I couldn't believe that she just did it,' said her mother Allison, 41, who is a nurse. 'It shows how well she's coming on.' Sophie will still need the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to be able to walk freely. She was born prematurely with spastic diplegia \u2013 a form of cerebral palsy. Her mother said: 'We are just so pleased Sophie has been able to take a step. It has all stemmed from the bike. She's on it all the time and the more she's on it the more strength she's getting. 'That is good news for the operation because the stronger she is the better. Without the donations from readers we would never have been able to afford the bike so I can't say how grateful we are.'

Mrs Thomlinson and her husband Craig, 45, from Dukinfield, near Manchester, began fundraising last year after they were told the NHS did not routinely fund the life-changing operation. Thanks to the Mail, they raised the money required for surgery in the UK but then received another blow in May when they were told Sophie's condition was 'not severe enough yet' to meet the criteria in this country, despite being unable to walk. They are trying to raise the remaining \u00a317,000 to fund the cost of Sophie's surgery and therapy in the US.

        "article": "An Adelaide mother, who says her one year old daughter was scarred for life after being badly burnt on some play equipment, has taken to social media to warn other parents against the dangers of unprotected play equipment. One year old Ella Brooks was at the new playground in Semaphore, north west of Adelaide, \u00a0on the morning of November 13, with her grandma when she suffered severe burns to her right left after sitting on the 'hurdy gurdy' merry-go-round. Her mother Amanda Hann, who was clearly distressed by the incident says the 'pictures of the horrific burn speak for themselves'. Scroll down to video . One year old Ella Brooks was at the new playground in Semaphore, with her grandma when she suffered severe burns (pictured) to her right left after sitting on the merry-go-round . On a 26/27 degree day this merry-go-round at a Semaphore playground got so hot it badly burnt a one year old girl . Ella (pictured) had several trips to the hospital for treatment and constant dressings after she was badly burnt at Semaphore playground . In a Facebook post she said the day was only about 26 or 27 degrees but the equipment clearly hadn't been made to withstand warm days, 'let alone the Australian sun'. 'Several trips to the hospital for treatment and constant dressing, not to mention the care and strain on us at home to keep the area clean and dressed 24/7 with a highly active toddler,' she said. 'She is only one year old and is now scarred for life and this has ruined her whole summer as she cannot do water activities or play in sandpits etc. because the area is so sensitive'. In her post she has warned other parents to be 'Beware of the new Semaphore playground' claiming they are a risk to any child who climbs/falls/sits onto the checkerboard surface. 'I don't want any other child to suffer the way mine has,' she said. The post went viral and has been shared more than 14,000 times, with a variety of comments from concerned and angry parents. Ella's parents Amanda Hann (pictured right) and Dylan Brooks (pictured left) say it has ruined their daughter's summer as she cannot get the burn wet and the dressing has to be changed constantly . Amanda Hann (pictured with Ella) took to social media to warn other parents about the dangers of an unprotected playground . The post went viral and saw a number of comments from concerned and angry parents . The post was shared nearly 14,000 times and incited plenty of comments who were worried about the one year old . Some users gave some advice about what to do when at a playground . Some were angry the play equipment wasn't checked before kids were able to use it . One mother wondered why they didn't have shade over the playground while another commented that parents should check the playground by feeling equipment, just to be over cautious. Many felt very sorry for little Ella while others felt Ms Hann should look into claiming compensation after the incident. Following the overwhelming response, Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned off the piece of play equipment. Acting technical services director, Robert Tiggemann said the playground was upgraded this year and opened to the public early September. 'The playground is compliant with Australian Standards and has shade over parts of the playground and cost approximately $480,000 and was manufactured by a German Company,' he said. 'We understand the Company supply playgrounds all over the world.' Ella (pictured) suffered a severe burn after sitting on a piece of playground equipment at Semaphore . Port Adelaide Enfield council cordoned the play equipment off after complaints after hearing of the incident . Mr Tiggemann said the council were alerted to the incident on Tuesday, November 25 following the information being posted to Facebook. 'We understand the incident occurred on 13th November and we believe the child was about 1 year old, the forecast on the 13th November was 38 degrees in Adelaide,' he said. 'Neither the parents of the child or anyone else has contacted the Council regarding the matter.' But council took action and closed down the 'Hurdy Gurdy' and organised a spongy rubber coating to be installed and it is now open again for kids to use. Port Adelaide Enfield council installed a spongy rubber coating on the 'hurdy gurdy' (pictured right) and it has now been re-opened . A local mum who has taken her kids to the playground on many occasions told Daily Mail Australia she believes there are a couple of really poor designs within the park. 'There's a flying fox that most kids can't reach and the bigger ones that can swing so low their legs touch the ground,' she said. 'There's also a great climbing wall but it's positioned in a spot so that it blocks a lot of your view which means you can lose sight of where your kids are.' 'You'd think if you were going to pour so much money into a playground in such an important location for the suburb they'd get it right!'",

        "article": "A man and a woman who had 'known each other just minutes' left dozens of shoppers in California horrified after they stripped off and had sex in front of a crowded prom dress store in broad daylight. The strangers, who had reportedly met on the trolley and 'did not know each other's names', were spotted writhing around  outside Christina's Dress Shop in Chula Vista at around 3.30pm on Friday. For the first 15 minutes, they cuddled and kissed while fully dressed, witnesses said. Then, the man stripped off his clothes and began 'getting sexual' with the woman, who was still wearing a skirt. Shop owner, Christy Peterson, who captured the\u00a0amorous encounter on video through the window, said\u00a0the sight had shocked shoppers inside and outside of the store, including a woman with a baby. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Two strangers left dozens of shoppers in California horrified when they stripped off and had sex in front of a prom dress store. Above, the man and woman are pictured just seconds before they 'got sexual' Scene: The strangers, who had met on the San Diego Trolley and did not know each others' names, were spotted writhing around outside Christina's Dress Shop (pictured) in Chula Vista at around 3.30pm on Friday . 'They were rolling on the ground, making out and getting sexual,' said Ms Peterson, adding that she had later heard police  refer to the woman as being 37, while the man was 'not even 21 years old'. In the video footage, the strangers can be seen rolling around on the sidewalk outside the dress shop in Palomar Street, which was crammed with teenage girls shopping for prom gowns at the time. The man is captured donning a yellow hooded top, pants and sneakers, while his lover is dressed in a yellow T-shirt, a skirt and ballet pumps. Both appear unaware that \u00a0their actions were being filmed. Ms Peterson said the woman kept her skirt on as the cuddling escalated to sex. 'Her legs were in the air and the guy was on top. We were so shocked our mouths were just opened,' she told\u00a010 News. Embracing: For the first 15 minutes, the pair cuddled and kissed while fully dressed, witnesses said. Then, the man stripped off his clothes and began 'getting sexual' with the woman, who was still wearing a skirt . In public view: Shop owner, Christy Peterson, who captured the encounter on video through the window, said the sight had shocked shoppers inside and outside of the prom dress store, including a woman with a baby . Owner: 'They were rolling on the ground, making out and getting sexual,' said Ms Peterson (pictured), adding that she had later heard police refer to the woman as being aged 37, while the man was 'not even 21' She added that when security failed to show up at the shopping strip mall, she called the police, while ushering customers to the back of the store in an attempt to shield them from the indecent display. 'We were just panicked and there were customers,' Ms Peterson told the news station. 'A woman with her baby and 16-, 17- [and] 18-year-old girls were here to shop for prom and got the shock of their life.' A 17-year-old 'trainee' working her first day at the shop also saw the 'unbelievable' scene, she said. After police arrived, the man was reportedly arrested. The woman, meanwhile, was handed a citation. Officers apparently later revealed the couple had  just met while commuting on the San Diego Trolley. Detained: The man was reportedly arrested by police following the engagement, while the woman was handed a citation. The strangers remained 'cuddled up' while being dealt with by officers, Ms Peterson said . Meeting: The couple had reportedly met on the San Diego Trolley (above) just minutes before they had sex . The strangers remained 'cuddled up' while being dealt with by officers, according to Ms Peterson. It is not the first time a couple has hit the headlines after being caught having sex in public view. Last month, a senior insurance broker in his late 40s was caught on camera engaging in a sex romp with a junior almost half his age at their workplace: Marsh Ltd insurance firm in  New Zealand. The broker, who is married with a 15-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, is now fighting\u00a0to keep his job as a regional manager at the firm after photos of the affair went viral, according to reports.",

        "article": "Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The vast majority of comedians lean to the left. Right-wing comedy is a rarity on the Internet. And Republicans are typically easier to make fun of than Democrats. But comedians shouldn't take a political stance when trying to be funny. That was the consensus of a panel of admittedly left-leaning comedy experts at South By Southwest Interactive, the digital culture festival under way in this Texas capital. \"Comedy has a recklessness that doesn't lend itself to the conservative lifestyle,\" said Rory Albanese, an executive producer and writer for \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\" \"It's the same reason why Christian rock bands aren't as good as regular rock bands.\" Albanese was joined on the panel by Carol Hartsell, comedy editor of The Huffington Post, and comedian-author Sara Benincasa, a contributor to Vice.com -- although Albanese did most of the talking. During a freewheeling hour, the trio riffed on everything from the nature of humor online to GOP candidate Rick Santorum's recent comment that President Barack Obama is \"a snob\" for wanting young people to attend college. Albanese admitted that after eight years of making jokes about President George W. Bush, it was difficult at first for \"The Daily Show\" to take aim at Obama. He said Obama's measured statements aren't easy targets for parody. \"There's funny stuff on the left, but sometimes you have to dig a little deeper. I can't say all the lies in politics come from the right. I think a lot of them come from the left,\" he said during the event Friday. \"I do think it's important to try and come at things from all sides. What we do is poke fun at the [political] system, poke fun at the process.\" Panelists agreed that partisan politics has almost nothing to do with what's funny online. \"I don't think the Internet leans left,\" said Albanese, citing the Drudge Report and the far-right rhetoric in some online-comment threads. \"It's a bad idea [for comedy sites] to pick a path politically before they go after what's funny.\" Benincasa agreed, saying there's a reason most of the most popular clips on YouTube don't feature politics but cute cats and guys getting smacked in the groin. Yet asked by moderator Alf Lamont to name a single right-leaning comedy site, the panel drew a blank. They also couldn't name any conservative comedians, save for maybe Dennis Miller. Hartsell said most of the comedians she knows are questioning, angst-ridden people whose insecurities may not jibe with conservative mind-sets. Albanese said the 2011-2012 Republican primary campaign, with such colorful candidates as Rick Perry and Hermain Cain, has been comic gold for \"The Daily Show\" and other jokesters. \"With all due respect to the candidates, there is the view that all of them are insane. A guy like Santorum, who's taking an anti-college stance? That's funny. I mean, who the f--- is against college?\" Satirical TV shows such as \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" can raise viewers' awareness about political issues. But Albanese believes they shouldn't be someone's only source of news. \"When people say, 'I get all my news from 'The Daily Show,' I say, 'Well, that's a good start.' It's a launching point. But it's not a place to form your opinions.\" Hartsell believes social media has democratized comedy by giving everyone a platform to be funny -- whether it's in Facebook updates, in brief Twitter jokes or goofy images on Pinterest. \"People just naturally want to make other people laugh,\" she said. \"It's hard to find an audience when you want to be funny. When you're a kid, it's your family. But when you're an adult, the Internet gives you a constant audience. It may just be 20 friends on Facebook, but it's an audience.\"",

It looks like the aftermath of a tropical storm, but this scene of destruction took place on a farm in Worcestershire yesterday. A tornado uprooted trees and tore the roof of a stable as it swept past the village of Inkberrow in the mid-afternoon. Amazingly, the fierce winds threw the stable roof 20metres through the air before it came to rest stuck in the branches of a nearby tree. Other trees were left broken in half at the Knowle Fields Barn Farm complex. Twister: A tornado ripped the roof off a building and pulled up trees in Worcestershire yesterday . Waterlogged: Many roads in Essex became flooded on Friday, like this one in Ingatestone, after heavy rain . Incredibly, the storm passed over . workers in a nearby office building, who didn't realise the extent of . the damage until they stepped outside after it had finished. Dawn Wheatcroft, office manager at . partitioning company Waterson's Projects, which is based on the site, . said that the storm seemed to 'last forever'. She said: 'It seemed like forever whilst it was happening, although it probably lasted less than a minute. 'It was a bit of a grey day but you never expect something like that to happen, it was one of the worst storms I've ever seen.' Flooding: Heavy rain in the south . caused road closures in Southampton yesterday . Weather experts believe the tornado may have been a funnel cloud, which can still cause destruction if it touches the ground. Tornado sightings were also reported in nearby Redditch at the same time. If not a washout, Bonfire Night looks . set to be something of a damp squid as floods and torrential rain from . last night give way to light rain mainly confined to Lincolnshire, East . Anglia and South-East England. Across remaining parts of the UK it will be a dry night with mostly clear skies. Cold across Scotland and Northern . Ireland with a widespread ground frost and an air frost in places. Mist . and fog patches will develop too across parts of the north where winds . are light. Washout: Floods and heavy rain may turn Bonfire Night parties being held over the weekend into wet events forecasters have warned .",

        "article": "By . Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . Residents of a tiny village in Ohio are up in arms after they say a game warden shot and killed a tame deer in front of children who had befriended the animal. People in Clarington - population 384 - said the deer has become known in the area for its friendly demeanor, allowing children and adults to pet it and pose for pictures with it. But an officer with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources was determined to shoot the creature citing the unpredictable nature of wild animals, especially during mating season. Scroll down for video . Poor deer: This friendly fawn was shot dead by an Ohio wildlife officer because it was deemed a public safety hazard . Friendly fawn: The young buck showed up in the Clarington area a few months ago and proved itself to be very friendly, allowing kids and adults to pet him . According to Clarington Mayor Droug Wagner, the wildlife agency learned of the tame deer from a local resident who complained about the animal eating out of his garden. The deer was first spotted in the area several months ago wearing a collar around its neck, Martins Ferry Times Leader reported. The fawn was described as being comfortable around children and adults alike. The wildlife officer who was put on the case spent days stalking the deer, and on Monday he arrived in Clarington with the intention to shoot the critter. But his plan was foiled by the presence of angry residents who came to the deer\u2019s defense. On Wednesday, Shannon Lee and her two daughters were sitting on their porch when they heard a gunshot. Mrs Lee said it took the ODNR officer about 30 minutes to corner the deer before he was able to kill the animal within earshot of her daughter, Olivia, who took a liking to the friendly creature. Traumatic experience: Shannon Lee and her two daughters were sitting on their porch Wednesday when a wildlife officer shot the deer without giving them a warning . 'i petted it, and i would feed it, and i would play with it some more, and it was my best friend,\u2019 the little girl told the station WTRF. The girl\u2019s mother expressed anger that the officer with the state agency failed to warn her and other parents about what was to come. Heartbroken: Olivia Lee said she used to feed and play with the tame young deer, which she descrbied as her best friend . \u2018They saw us sitting on the porch, they didn't tell us, \u201cCan you please take the kids inside...\u201d [there was] no warning at all until we heard the gunshot,\u2019 Shannon Lee said. According to Tim Parrett, district manager with the ODNR, the deer had to be put down because it was a public safety hazard. \u2018Everyone understands the curiosity and the value of wildlife, with this opportunity to touch it, but people don't realize this is still a wild animal, and they're unpredictable,\u2019 Parrett explained. \u2018Especially a buck with antlers, all it has to do is flick its head and it can seriously injure a child or adult. The potential for danger is there.\u2019 Parrett added that it would have been irresponsible not to kill the deer. Some concerned residents have called on the wildlife agency to relocate the friendly buck, but Parrett said that if the deer was ill with chronic wasting disease - a degenerative condition affecting the brain - it could have spread it to other animals. The manager added that the deer's friendly behavior was abnormal and a possible indicator that the animal was ill. Justification: State wildlife officials said shooting the animal was the only responsible thing to do because it may have been sick . WTRF 7 News Sports Weather - Wheeling Steubenville .",

If the two men have decided to get along after a few years of discord then its perhaps as well. They will be seeing quite a bit of each other over the coming years. Before this season started, most people had Manchester City and Chelsea as the two teams most likely to win the Barclays Premier League. Perhaps we should go further now. After only a month of the new season, they look the only teams capable of winning it. Rival managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho embrace after the 1-1 draw at the Etihad on Sunday . Speaking on TV at full-time yesterday, former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness said eloquently: \u2018These two are head and shoulders above everybody else. They don\u2019t have weaknesses.\u2019 On a weekend that saw Liverpool fail at West Ham and Manchester United embarrass themselves at Leicester, this was proper football. There was resilience, organisation and devastating quality. There were goals from substitutes and contributions from players operating in unfamiliar positions. There was an absence of panic from Manchester City when they fell a man, and then a goal, behind. Equally there was no complacency from Chelsea when they won a lead the general pattern of play had not pointed to. The Manchester United bench is stunned after falling to a catastrophic 5-3 defeat to Leicester City from 3-1 up . Liverpool manager instructs captain Steven Gerrard during their lacklustre 3-1 defeat to West Ham . Had Diego Costa not struck a post with the score at 1-0, they would have had a win of significance. Referee Mike Dean almost ruined the afternoon. Not by sending off Pablo Zabaleta for a second booking, but by distributing so many yellow cards in the first half that a red one always seemed possible, if not inevitable, later on. A victory for Chelsea would have felt just a little hollow. Until the sending off, they had been marginally second best in a contest that was notable at that point for some expert defending by both teams. Pellegrini attempts to reason with Mourinho during the enthralling match between their sides at the Etihad . Eliaquim Mangala, on debut for Manchester City, was magnificent alongside Vincent Kompany in defence . Despite the late drama, the pairings of Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala and John Terry and Gary Cahill were the stand-out features of this game. Partnerships like those win titles, despite the millions of pounds invested in players at the other end of the field. Happily, City were able to regain parity. Happily because it left us talking about a fair result and a remarkable Frank Lampard story rather than the referee\u2019s influence. City\u2019s equaliser was interesting and told us much about their qualities. James Milner had performed terrifically down the right side, providing evidence that English players can thrive at City if they are good enough. But it was from the position of left back that he advanced to provide Lampard with the opportunity to equalise. Running on to David Silva\u2019s chipped pass, Milner was on the stretch but the touch he applied to the ball was perfect in weight and in direction. Andre Schurrle celebrates scoring Chelsea's opener but rarely starts due to competition for places in the side . Substitutes are increasingly important in the Premier League, especially to those clubs with Champions League commitments. Squads win championships, as they say. Andre Schurrle is a good one, too. The German showed this during the World Cup in Brazil. Here, he timed his far post run perfectly in the 71st minute, allowing him to make the most of a superb Eden Hazard cross that was enabled in the first place by a superb turn and pass from Costa. This is what makes these teams so impressive, so effective. Costa, for example, had endured a difficult afternoon. In trying to impose himself physically on City captain Kompany, he had failed. Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . In essence, he had lost one of the pivotal personal duals of the game. Still, though, he was able to influence the outcome. Both clubs have benefited from long-term planning and transfer strategy. As United are finding, big money deals pushed through at the last minute will only take you so far. Mangala was immense on his debut on Sunday, only slightly less effective than Kompany. Costa also emerged to play his part, too. Chelsea and City were fine teams last season but they have improved and whether anyone else can really get near them is very doubtful. In the press conference room, Pellegrini and Mourinho reverted to type and started criticising each other. Maybe that hug meant nothing at all. Maybe it pointed at relief and satisfaction in equal measure. Lampard shakes hand with his former Chelsea team mate John Terry at the final whistle at the Etihad . Mourinho ad Pellegrini shake hands but they were far from complimentary in the post match interviews .",

        "article": "Postcards sketched by Britain's most notorious convict Charles Bronson worth thousands of pounds have been discovered in a drawer in a London art gallery. The collection of postcards, hand-drawn by Bronson, were found buried beneath old canvases and paper scraps and will now be offered for sale at the Zebra One Gallery in Hampstead, London. The owner of the gallery, Gabrielle du Plooy believes there will be a high demand from collectors, and has pledged to donate the money raised from the sale of the postcards to the families of Bronson's victims. The Birdman Of Broadmoor was one of the pieces of work found in the drawer of an art gallery . One of the most recent images of criminal Charles Bronson taken inside Wakefield Prison in June 2004 . Two hundred of the jailbird's works were sold for more than \u00a330,000 at an auction in Leicestershire recently, coinciding with the discovery. In an attempt to distance himself from his violent past, the criminal has changed his last name to 'Salvador', in homage to surrealist artist, Salvador Dali. He is said to spend his days in his cell, painting and sketching to pass the time during his life sentence. Speaking about the postcards, Ms du Plooy said: 'They are ridiculous but you can certainly see the influence of Salvador Dali.' The postcards were originally procured by the gallery's former owner, Ms du Plooy's father, who acquired them from Bedlam Bar in Hampstead, which is now closed. The postcards are thought to be worth thousands of pounds . Manson changed his surname to Salvador after the artist Salvador Dali, it is thought he influenced his work . 'It was a very dark and dingy bar with loads of mad artwork on the walls,' said Ms du Plooy. 'You walked in and it was quite literally bedlam - there were chains and skulls everywhere. 'We were doing all their framing for them and we were given these postcards.' 'The pieces of art are authenticated by Bronson's own signature, along with a note that reads 'a Bronson creation'. 'The postcards are also annotated with the addresses of the prisons where the sketches were drawn, along with the convict's prison number: 1314.' A lot of the artworks show words such as Insanity and Asylum . The notorious convict signs each of the postcards to make his mark . This postcard called the Beast of Dartmoor features an angry looking man . The 61-year-old criminal is currently serving a life sentence in HM Full Sutton prison in York. He has spent 36 years in solitary confinement after numerous attacks on prison staff and fellow inmates, including instigating hostage incidents. But he recently hit headlines again when one of his pieces was stolen from a gallery in east London. The hardman - who was portrayed by Tom Hardy in the film Bronson - chillingly warned the thieves: 'Pray that I never catch up with you.' Despite being drawn by one of Britain's most notorious criminals this postcard is quite sweet in design . Charles marks his postcards with the words 'A BRONSON CREATION' This design features a pony with a small bird on the end of his nose . 1974: First jailed, aged 22, for armed robbery (seven years' jail) 1975: Attacked fellow prisoner with a glass jug (nine months' jail) 1985: A three-day rooftop protest at Walton Gaol caused \u00a3100K worth of damage (one year jail) 1988: Sent back to prison for robbing a jewellery shop (seven years' jail) 1992: Released from prison but shortly afterwards found guilty of intent to rob (eight years' jail) 1994: Holds prison librarian hostage, demanding inflatable doll, helicopter and cup of tea (eight years' jail) 1998: Takes three inmates hostage at Belmarsh. Insists they call him \u2018General\u2019 and threatens to eat one of them unless demands are met (five years' jail, reduced from seven on appeal) 1999: Given life sentence for kidnapping prison teacher Phil Danielson at Hull jail (life sentence with a three-year tariff) 2014: Assaulted prison governor Alan Parkins (two years' jail)",

        "article": "The US Air Force has told a sergeant he will have to leave the military unless he agrees to take an oath with the phrase 'so help me God,' officials said Tuesday. In the latest religious controversy to roil the air force, the atheist airman last month was denied his request to re-enlist because of his refusal to swear to God -- and he is now poised to take the military to court, his lawyer said. 'We have not received word from the Air Force regarding our letter. It has not indicated a willingness to settle out of court,' said Monica Miller, an attorney for the American Humanist Association, which has taken up the service member's case. The US Air Force has told a sergeant he will have to leave the military unless he agrees to take an oath with the phrase 'so help me God,' officials said Tuesday. The airman is based at Creech Air Force base in Nevada . With the deadline for re-enlisting expiring in November, the technical sergeant at Creech Air Force base in Nevada - whose name has not been released - will be forced to sue the government in a federal court, Miller told AFP. In the past, an airman could opt for an alternative phrase and omit the words 'so help me God,' but the US Air Force changed its policy in October 2013. The other branches of the American military do not require the reference to God and make the phrase optional. The other branches of the American military do not require the reference to God and make the phrase optional . 'This is the only branch to my knowledge that's actually requiring everyone in all instances to use the religious language,' Miller said. The requirement violates the US Constitution, which bars religious tests to hold office or other positions, Miller said of the case, which was first reported by the Air Force Times. 'The government cannot compel a nonbeliever to take an oath that affirms the existence of a supreme being,' she said. The sergeant's service expires in November and he has until then to re-enlist and take the oath, said US Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. In the meantime, 'a written legal opinion is being requested' from the Pentagon's top lawyer, she said. The air force has been plagued by controversy for years over religion and the role of Christian evangelists. The US Air Force Academy in Colorado faced accusations several years ago that evangelical Christians exerted a dominating influence over the institution. But attempts to counter the perceived bias in the service have sparked criticism from Christian activist groups, who allege a new rule stifles the religious expression of troops. The disputed rule bars commanders from promoting their religious convictions to their subordinates. Advocates of the policy say it protects troops who worry their careers could be jeopardized if they do not take part in their superior's Christian activities.",

Scaredy-cat: German Shepherd Vegas has been rejected by Northumbria Police because she is too nervous to bite . Real-life Scooby Doo: The 19-month-old is now searching for a new home - although she is not suitable for families with young children or other dogs . Officers at Northumbria Police . rejected the 19-month-old during a rigorous selection process because . they feared she would be too soft on villains. After failing her application, police dog handlers hoped that her docile nature would make her an ideal family pet. However they then discovered she is scared of children, forcing them to hunt for an adult-only home for her. The German shepherd was one of a . litter of eight pups bred for police duty. She was taught to jump . through windows, ignore gunshots and sink her teeth into knife-wielding . criminals. Although she passed some of the . tests, she was deemed to be too hesitant when it came to biting. Dog . Section Sergeant John Sim said: \u2018Surprisingly, not all dogs find it . natural to bite. \u2018For a good bite the dogs have to get . their timing right to take hold of whoever they are chasing in a . determined and positive way and keep hold until instructed to let\u00a0 go by . the handler.

        "article": "Drugs such as low-dose aspirin (pictured) would be more effective if timed with the body\u2019s natural rhythms, new research says . Many popular pills \u2013 including some cholesterol-busting statins \u2013 would be better taken at night than in the morning, scientists believe. They say widely-used tablets such as low-dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body\u2019s natural rhythms. Scientists showed that individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. They found that nearly half of all mouse genes work harder at some points in the 24-hour cycle than others, with \u2018rush hours\u2019 of activity just before dawn and dusk. Although the study was on mice, most mouse genes have \u2018twins\u2019 in humans. Many common drugs home in on these genes and so should be most effective when the genes are most active. This is particularly important in the case of medicines such as aspirin, which are broken down quickly by the body. The University of Pennsylvania study found 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US act on genes that ebb and flow over the day. Similarly, 119 of the 250 pills on the World Health Organisation\u2019s list of essential medicines may work better at a certain time of the day, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Pennsylvania University\u2019s pharmacology professor John Hogenesch said more work is needed to say when is the best time to take each pill. However, research already shows that low-dose aspirin, taken daily by millions of Britons who have survived a heart attack or stroke to keep their blood thin, is best taken at night. This ensures the drug has time to work before morning \u2013 the peak time for heart attacks. Likewise, simvastatin, one of the most widely-used cholesterol-lowering statin pills, should also be taken at bedtime. This is because the drug works by blocking a key step in the production of cholesterol, and the gene behind this step is most active at night. Patients are already told to take simvastatin in the evening, however many still take it at the wrong time. Some will take the drug in the morning to prevent them forgetting. Individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day.\u00a0Many common drugs home in on these genes \u2013 and so should be most effective if given when the genes are most active, say U.S. researchers . Professor Hogenesch said: \u2018There\u2019s a huge opportunity for improving the action of existing drugs through better timing.\u2019 Heidi Wright, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: \u2018Simvastatin\u2026is best taken at bedtime as your liver makes most of your cholesterol at night. \u2018Low-dose aspirin works by making your blood less sticky. There is research that says more heart attacks occur in the morning, so\u2026reducing this stickiness by the morning could help prevent heart attacks.\u2019 Women are putting their lives at risk by ignoring the symptoms of heart disease, researchers warn. Many brush pain off as indigestion or a pulled muscle and wait days or weeks before seeing a doctor. But in fact it could be a symptom of angina, where one of the arteries to the heart gets blocked, or a mild heart attack. Harvard researchers urge women not to assume heart attacks are a \u2018man\u2019s disease\u2019 and to seek help. Statistically, women are less likely to have a heart attack than men before the menopause, but afterwards they overtake them and are more at risk. Furthermore, heart attacks in women tend to be more severe than in men \u2013 possibly because they have ignored the warning signs. Lead author Dr Catherine Kreatsoulas, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said: \u2018Both men and women go into a phase of denial \u2013 but women seem to stay in this stage longer.\u2019",

        "article": "(CNN)As the United States gets ready to blame the Sony hack on North Korea, a troublesome question is emerging: Just what is North Korea capable of? Experts say the nation has spent scarce resources on building up a unit called \"Bureau 121\" to carry out cyberattacks. North Korea has been blamed in the past for attacks in South Korea, but the Sony hack -- if indeed North Korea is behind it -- would seem to represent an escalation of tactics. \"I think we underestimated North Korea's cybercapabilities,\" said Victor Cha, director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University. \"They certainly didn't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks.\" Cha was referring to attacks on South Korean broadcasters and banks last year. In March 2013, South Korean police said they were investigating a widespread computer outage that struck systems at leading television broadcasters and banks, prompting the military to step up its cyberalert level. The South Korean communications regulator reportedly linked the computer failures to hacking that used malicious code, or malware. An investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by the North previously, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean Ministry of Science. North Korea denied responsibility. A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army labeled the allegations \"groundless\" and \"a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase,\" according to KCNA, the North Korean state news agency. North Korea has similarly denied the massive hack of Sony Pictures, which has been forced to cancel next week's planned release of \"The Interview,\"  a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But KCNA applauded the attack. \"The hacking into the SONY Pictures might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK,\" it said, using the acronym of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \"The hacking is so fatal that all the systems of the company have been paralyzed, causing the overall suspension of the work and supposedly a huge ensuing loss.\" Experts point to several signs of North Korean involvement. They say there are similarities between the malware used in the Sony hack and previous attacks against South Korea. Both were written in Korean, an unusual language in the world of cybercrime. \"Unfortunately, it's a big win for North Korea. They were able to get Sony to shut down the picture. They got the U.S. government to admit that North Korea was the source of this and there's no action plan really, at least publicly no action plan, in response to it,\" said Cha. \"I think from their perspective, in Pyongyang, they're probably popping the champagne corks.\" CNN's Gregory Wallace, Brian Stelter, Evan Perez, K.J. Kwon and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Admission: Richard Dumas pleaded guilty on Thursday to two charges of theft . Former Phoenix Suns forward Richard Dumas has pleaded guilty to two counts of theft after being accused of stealing merchandise from a military base store. Maricopa County, Arizona prosecutors say the 45-year-old  entered his plea Thursday. He's scheduled to be sentenced January 20. Authorities say Dumas stole about $800 worth of merchandise from the Luke Air Force Base's exchange store while working with a janitorial service in 2012. They say Dumas was seen on surveillance cameras taking cigarettes, alcohol, food, DVDs and shoes. Dumas originally pleaded not guilty to eight felony charges of organized retail theft. Many of those charges were later dropped when he agreed to the plea deal. Dumas played for the Suns from 1992 to 1995 and helped the team reach the NBA Finals in 1993. He was waived by the team though after missing a drug test, and in 1998 he was arrested on cocaine charges. In the late 1990s, Dumas tried to resurrect his career by playing in Eastern Europe, but did not last long due to a knee injury. After retiring from basketball in 2003, Dumas started a charity program to mentor young athletes. He was arrested last year while working at the Richard Dumas and Friends Athletic Organization headquarters. Glory days: The 45-year-old played forward for the Phoenix Suns from 1992-1995, but was waived from the team in 1998 after missing a drug test .",

        "article": "A woman who developed anorexia after obsessing over stick-thin celebrities has beaten the illness - by being crowned Miss Toned Figure in a  bodybuilding tournament. Charlotte MacGill, 26, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, would pore over pictures of painfully thin models and celebrities such as Victoria Beckham. She would then starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap'. But as her weight dropped below eight stone, her health deteriorated. She became depressed and suffered skin problems, thinning hair and bad breath. It was only when she started a job as a physiotherapist and took up weight training that she managed to turn her life around. Scroll down for video . Charlotte MacGill, now 26, says taking up bodybuilding saved her from anorexia. She is pictured above at her lowest weight, when she would starve herself and exercise to excess in a bid for an elusive 'thigh-gap' She has now been crowned Miss Toned Figure after swapping starvation for healthy food and weight training . Now Ms MacGill has become a muscly transformation of her former self, winning regional, national and global bodybuilding competitions. She said: 'I became really body conscious when I was 16 and started going to aerobics with my mum. 'Suddenly I was desperate to look like celebrities like Britney Spears who had washboard stomachs and Victoria Beckham with her slim thighs. 'But bodybuilding changed my life - I know how to exercise properly now and can't believe how unhealthy I was before.' As a teenager, Ms MacGill became influenced by airbrushed models and slim celebrities in magazines and strived to look exactly like them. In particular she craved a 'thigh gap' and washboard stomach. At 18 she joined a gym and became addicted to exercise. She said: 'I just wanted to run any excess weight off. I ran six days a week. 'My goal was always to stay below eight stone, so you could see my ribs and I'd have a 'thigh gap'. 'For more than two years, I worked out religiously at the gym but didn't know what I was doing or how to achieve what I wanted. I was desperate for the size zero body shape I saw in magazines.' Still not happy with the way she looked, she started dieting in the hope of gaining the 'perfect' figure. Ms MacGill (pictured centre in a green bikini) competing at the a global bodybuilding competition . 'I know how to exercise properly now and can't believe how unhealthy I was before,' Ms Mac Gill says, pictured left . Her addiction continued while she studied sport rehabilitation at the University of Bolton, with the added strain of the typical student lifestyle on her body. She said: 'When I went on nights out with friends, I'd binge on drinks as well as takeaways. That way, I could convince myself I wasn't anorexic. 'We'd get junk food after leaving a nightclub but I'd feel guilty afterwards and have to run even further on the treadmill. 'In fact, the takeaways were probably the only thing stopping me from becoming dangerously thin. I was so hungry sometimes that I would binge-eat on cakes and sweets. 'A couple of times, I made myself sick and that's when I realised I had lost control. 'It wasn't an eating disorder, but it was starting to become one.' Ms Mac Gill starved herself and exercised to excess from the age of 16. She suffered side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life. She is pictured (left and right) as a teenager when her eating disorder began . She added: 'I would just repeat the diet every day and I started to suffer side effects like thinning hair, bad breath, spots and I sometimes became depressed about life. 'Looking back, it's clear that I did have an eating disorder but I didn't see it then.' After graduating, Ms MacGill got a job as a physiotherapist in her hometown of Bolton and her obsession with exercise didn't go unnoticed by her boss. Worried that she had a warped body image and was in no position to help rehabilitate their clients, he asked her to write down her daily diet. She said: 'He said my diet was shocking and told me I should stop running. He gave me an eating plan to increase my calories and got me doing weight training four times a week. 'He introduced a lot more healthy carbohydrates into my diet and tripled the amount I was eating. 'I was really worried I was going to get fat but I knew he knew what he was talking about. I put all my trust in him. 'I had porridge or muesli for breakfast, lots of rice and chicken, sweet potatoes, low fat rice pudding and bananas.' She warns  success in bodybuilding competitions doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. Now, she hopes to inspire women to aim to be toned and healthy, not skinny . Ms MacGill began bodybuilding, as well as eating a lot more healthy carbohydrates tripled the amount she was eating. A year later she entered her first bodybuilding competition and won it. She is pictured holding outfits to wear in competitions . Within just two months, Ms MacGill was so pleased with the transformation in her body shape, she decided she wanted to try out for a competition run by the National Amateur Bodybuilders' Association (NABBA). She said: 'My boss was amazed when I got serious about bodybuilding so quickly, but I wanted something to focus on. 'I was building muscle as well as fat and I felt so much better in myself, so I entered my first competition eight weeks later. She won her first regional competition in May 2012, but after the losing the next one, took some time out from competing to train properly. In October 2014, she entered three competitions in the 'toned figure' category and was crowned champion in all three - including the global title. But she warns the success doesn't come easy - it requires months of strict dieting and training. She said: 'I eat lots of white fish and green vegetables, oats and rice cakes. I'm very strict with myself and don't have any treats at all. MsMacGill says she has the full support of her boyfriend, who is also a bodybuilder. Both plan to compete next year to add to the regional, national and globlal titles Ms MacGill has already won . In October 2014 she entered three competitions run by the National Amateur Bodybuilders' Association (NABBA) - and won all of them . 'But, when I'm not getting ready to compete, I pig out and eat whatever I like. I love pick'n'mix and chocolate and have such a sweet tooth.' 'Knowing you have a goal in mind makes it all worth it, though. You get a thrill from it - it feels amazing to build your own physique. I get lots of compliments on my figure and lots of requests for arm wrestles!' Ms MacGill has the full support of her boyfriend, fellow physiotherapist John Ramsay, 28, who is also a bodybuilder. 'We're like a normal couple and go out for meals together when we're not preparing for a competition, but when we are, we have to be careful about what we're eating. 'We cook each other meals and say, 'How many grams of protein would you like?' Both plan to compete again next year and Ms MacGill believes her transformation isn't over yet. She said: 'My family and friends are really supportive and follow what I do. They're so proud that I'm healthy now and I've changed my body image. 'Obsessing over unrealistic celebrity images was really damaging to me as a teenager so I hope that my new body shape will inspire teenage girls to concentrate on being toned and healthy rather than skinny.'

        "article": "(CNN)Police officer and former U.S. Army Ranger John Moynihan was honored at the White House less than a year ago as one of the nation's \"Top Cops\" for helping to save a transit officer wounded in a gunbattle with the Boston Marathon bombers. On Saturday, Moynihan, 34, was in a medically induced coma at a Boston hospital after being shot in the face at point-blank range in the city's Roxbury neighborhood the night before. The gunman was shot and killed. \"He's a strong kid,\" Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. \"He's a fighter. He's going to pull through.\" On Sunday, after several hours of surgery to remove the bullet from his neck, Moynihan, who had been listed in critical condition, was in stable and improving condition, according to a Twitter posting by the Boston Police Department. A six-year police veteran and member of the youth violence task force, Moynihan was shot below the right eye. The bullet lodged behind his right ear, Evans said. In April 2013, Moynihan was among officers who helped save transit officer Richard H. Donohue Jr., who was shot during a gunfight involving Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the marathon bombings. Police fired nearly 300 rounds within five to 10 minutes. One round nearly killed Donohue. Moynihan and other Massachusetts officers were cited for their \"heroic and relentless\" life-saving measures on Donohue, who nearly lost his entire blood volume on the Watertown street. An officer pressed against Donuhue's chest. Another forced air into his lungs. The wound near his groin was too high for a tourniquet. A 33-year police veteran, Donohue was pale and appeared dead as four officers laid him on a gurney. \"He was essentially dead,\" said Dr. Heather Studley, who took over his care at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed that night; his younger brother is on trial now in a federal death penalty case in Boston. At a White House ceremony last May, President Barack Obama honored Moynihan and 52 other officers as \"America's Top Cops.\" \"There are officers here who were in the thick of two attacks last year:  the shooting at the Washington Naval Yard and the bombing at the Boston Marathon,\" Obama said at the time. \"On those awful days -- and we all remember them -- amid the smoke and the chaos, the courage of these officers shone through.  And their quick thinking and level-headedness undoubtedly saved lives.\" In a statement Saturday, Donohue wished Moynihan a full recovery, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. \"John played a part in saving my life, and that's something I will never forget,\" Donohue said. \"His record of service speaks for itself. Everyone is wishing him well and we know he has the strength to pull through.\" At 6:40 p.m. Friday, Moynihan and other officers pulled over a car in an area where gunshots had been reported earlier, Evans said. The primary job of the task force, also known as the gang unit, is to remove guns from the streets. Six officers in separate cars, sirens blaring, were involved in the traffic stop, which was captured by surveillance cameras in the area. Moynihan walked up to the driver's side door. A man started to step out. \"Without provocation, as the driver is getting out ... you can see his right arm come up point-blank and shot officer Moynihan right below the eye,\" Evans said. Evans described the officers approach as \"very low key\" and said they weren't \"even close to having their guns out.\" After shooting Moynihan, the suspect ran, turned around and fired at the other officers -- emptying his .357 Magnum, according to Evans. Evans said a middle-aged woman was who driving by at the time suffered a flesh wound in the right arm. She was not identified. The shooter, identified as 41-year-old Angelo West, was shot and killed. Evans said West had several prior gun convictions. Two passengers in the car were arrested on unrelated charges involving an outstanding warrant and a probation violation. \"None of our officers like to use their firearms,\" Evans said. \"It's probably the worst thing we have to do in our profession, but here, clearly unprovoked, one of our officers is shot point-blank in the face.\" At a news conference, Evans and local leaders sought to allay community concerns at a time when officer-involved shootings have led to protests throughout the nation. Moynihan is white; West was black. \"Our officers did what they had to do,\" the police commissioner said. The Rev. Mark Scott of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston said Moynihan was shot \"assassination-style.\" He called for calm in the predominantly black Roxbury section. \"This is not about 'Black Lives Matter,'\" he said, referring to a protest movement that emerged after the shootings. \"It's about all-the-lives-in-the-community matter and it's about the police ... responding to a concern from the community.\" Evans said 1,071 guns were taken off the streets in Boston in 2014, with the youth violence task force and other units helping to seize more than 700. Moynihan is a decorated Army Ranger with stints in Iraq from 2005 to 2008, according to the police department. He won the Boston Police Department's Medal of Honor in 2014. His girlfriend and family have been at his bedside. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.",

        "article": "Being on the receiving end of a bird's droppings is meant to bring good luck, according to the superstitious. But Kerry Morrison hasn't had much joy for the last four months. Her bizarre plan to make music based on bird poo, partly funded by the taxpayer, has run into difficulties - because of a lack of muck. Since June, visitors to parks in Liverpool may have seen the self-proclaimed environmental artist laying huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraging birds to do their business on them. Bizarre: Environmental artist Kerry Morrison is trying to make music based on droppings, but the taxpayer-funded project has been hampered because birds haven't produced enough . Disinterested? Since June, Miss Morrison has laid huge, blank musical scores between trees and encouraged birds to do their business on them . Her plan was that the positioning of . the splats on the stave would inspire a new musical work to be performed . in the city's Tate gallery. Unfortunately, . the birds have been rather less than co-operative, and the 47-year-old . is still waiting for sufficient offerings from the sky to create the . piece. The performance was initially . expected to be held this month, but Tate Liverpool stressed it had never . been scheduled for a specific date and denied the project was running . late. Miss Morrison, whose previous work has included an attempt to create art from dog mess, came up with the idea, entitled Bird Sheet Music, while sitting in a park with friends. Launching the project in June, she described how it would \u2018harness some of their (the birds') fundamental doings\u2019 to take \u2018by chance nature\u2019s calls and represent what comes naturally\u2019. She went on: \u2018I will be laying blank score - on a scale of great magnitude - underneath places where birds roost and feed. \u2018As the birds go about their daily business, droppings will fall onto the score below. \u2018Each splat on the score will form a musical note, a cache of poo, an embellished score: bird s*** music.\u2019 The dropping marks were to be adapted by composer Jon Hering, but finding birds prepared to take part in the project has proved harder than expected. \u2018I thought it would be very straightforward first of all - they sit in a tree, they eat, they poo, you get the bird music and there you go - Bob\u2019s your uncle,\u2019 Miss Morrison said. 'But it\u2019s not like that at all.\u2019 A film crew accompanied Miss Morrison for four hours last week, but the birds provided only one note - an E. The artist said: \u2018I have had to learn . about bird behaviour and find out when and where they nest and perch, . so my bird-spotting skills have developed considerably.\u2019 It's oh so quiet: The bird dropping splats on the sheets are to be used for a new musical work to be performed at the Tate Liverpool . Project: Artist Helmut Lemke, who has been helping Miss Morrison, records sounds of the wilderness next to an large piece of sheet music laid down to capture bird droppings . Perhaps Kerry Morrison should have followed the old adage 'Never work with children or animals'. But she is not the first musician to have tried to involve the animal kingdom in her work. The Beatles song A Day In The Life, from the 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, ends with an extremely high note which only dogs can hear. The high note is said to have been dubbed into the track by producer George Martin at the request of John Lennon, pictured. The Beach Boys' critically-acclaimed 1966 album Pet Sounds includes animal noises and even has a picture of the band visiting a zoo on the front cover. And the video to dance act Basement Jaxx's song Where's Your Head At? featured monkeys with superimposed human faces. Miss Morrison has been helped by artist Helmut Lemke, who is recording sounds of the woodland for a planned exhibition. Although sheets with a . combined length of more than 400ft have been suitably soiled, another . 160ft is needed before the composition can begin. Miss Morrison, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire, is studying for a PhD at Salford University and incorporates elements from natural landscapes or wild animals in her work. Three years ago she invited walkers on a canal towpath to dodge dog mess, rewarding them with a sticker, a mug of tea and a biscuit if they succeeded. Bird Sheet Music is one of four projects she is working on as part of Tate Liverpool\u2019s series of outdoor exhibitions, Our Liverpool Landscape: From Turner To Today. It is understood to be partially funded through a \u00a350,000 grant made by the Arts Council towards the gallery\u2019s major events programme. According to the exhibition\u2019s website the projects are also supported by the U.S. Embassy in London. Tate Liverpool said no other public money funded Bird Sheet Music but declined to say how much of the Arts Council grant had gone towards it. It said the U.S. Embassy had supported the gallery\u2019s exhibition Turner Monet Twombly: Later Paintings which inspired the Liverpool Landscape productions, rather than the projects themselves. A spokeswoman for Tate Liverpool said: \u2018The project is ongoing because Kerry is still collecting the bird droppings for the music. \u2018It is our intention to have the transcribed composition performed at Tate Liverpool by the composer Jon Hering in the near future.\u2019 Prestigious: Bird Sheet Music is one of four projects Miss Morrison is working on as part of a series of outdoor exhibitions at Tate Liverpool .",

        "article": "By . Joshua Gardner . A South Carolina mom arrested for leaving her 9-year-old at a playground while she worked a shift at McDonald's is now out of a job. Debra Harrell was arrested for unlawful neglect of a child on June 30 when a stranger called police after finding the little girl alone on the North Augusta playground, a 600 yard walk from her mother's workplace. Another stranger has now taken up the mother's cause and started a fundraiser for Harrell that has topped $30,000. Unfairly accused? Debra Harrell was arrested June 30 after leaving her 9-year-old daughter at a playground while she worked her shift at McDonald's . Arrested: Debra was booked on unlawful child neglect charges and while she's been freed on bond, her daughter was placed in state custody, where she remains . That's a good for Harrell, since it's been revealed the 46-year-old is now out of a job and her daughter, now in state custody, is at present without a mother. On Tuesday, Harrell's attorney Robert Phillips told the Huffington Post that Harrell had been let go from her job, but that he didn't know why. 'She is currently unemployed,' he said. However, McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb maintained that Harrell's lack of a job was not the company's doing. 'It would not be appropriate to discuss an employment matter in the media, but I can confirm that this employee has not been terminated,' McComb wrote in statement. While the reason behind her joblessness is unclear, Harrell quite clearly needed the work enough to leave her daughter unattended in a playground. But many critics who initially judged her for her apparently heartless action have likely since given Harrell the benefit of a doubt. One woman, a complete stranger to Harrell, has become especially wrapped up in the working mom's cause and started a fundraiser to support her with huge success. That woman, Clair Ryan, makes the case for supporting Harrell on a YouCaring page she's set up for that purpose. 'It was . very likely a choice that Debra would not have made were there other . reasonable and affordable options available,' Ryan writes. Ryan says Harrell has been unfairly portrayed by some media outlets. 'Contrary to many reports, while the park . would be more than a mile from Debra's workplace by car, it is only a . few thousand feet - maybe a 5 minute walk - by foot,' she writes. 'The . little girl was given a cell phone so she could call her mom at any . time.' Opposing views: A complete stranger has taken up Harrell's cause with a fundraiser that has topped $30,000. That woman, Clair Ryan, says that while the playground is a mile from Harrell's McDonald's by car, its is around 600 yards on foot . Ryan says Harrell only chose to send her daughter to the playground after the laptop computer the 9-year-old once played on in the restaurant while her mother worked was stolen from their home. Ryan's YouCaring page for Harrell had already tripled its $10,000 goal. And with 21 days to go and support building for the mother, she and her daughter will likely get far more than $30,000. Which is more than enough to get the little girl a new computer and into a good summer camp or day care. While Harrell may have those blessings to look forward to, for now she remains out of jail on bond as she awaits trial, her daughter languishing in the state's care. 'Taking her daughter away has also surely been a slap in the face to Debra, writes Ryan. 'It sends a message that as a working mom, all her efforts are just not good enough.' 'Currently unemployed': Since Harrell's June 30 arrest, she has reportedly cut ties with the McDonald's location where she worked. The company says they did not fire her, while Harrell's attorney said Monday the 46-year-old is 'currently unemployed'",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Lots of love for \"12 Years a Slave.\" A big push for \"American Hustle.\" Nothing for \"Lee Daniels' The Butler.\" The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the little group (about 100 members) with the outsized influence, presented the nominations for the 71st Annual Golden Globes on Thursday morning, and some trends quickly became obvious. Given that the Globes are often used as tea leaf samples with which to forecast the Big Daddy of awards shows -- the Oscars -- what do they indicate? 1) \"12 Years a Slave\" and \"American Hustle\" are the front-runners. \"Slave,\" the Steve McQueen film about a free man taken into slavery in 19th-century America, dominated the proceedings among dramatic films. (The Globes spread the wealth by having categories for both film dramas and film comedies, and do the same for television shows.) It received seven nominations, including nods for best drama, best director, best actor in a drama (Chiwetel Ejiofor), best supporting actor (Michael Fassbender) and best supporting actress (Lupita Nyong'o). \"Hustle\" matched that number, earning nominations for best comedy or musical, best director (David O. Russell), best actor in a comedy/musical (Christian Bale), best actress in a comedy/musical (Amy Adams), best supporting actor (Bradley Cooper) and best supporting actress (Jennifer Lawrence). Expect a lot of the same when the Oscar nominations are announced January 16. 2014 Golden Globe nominations: The list . 2) You call these comedies? Of the five films nominated for best comedy or musical, none is an out-and-out laugh riot. In fact, a couple are as dark as they come -- and probably richer than the nominated dramas. \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" the Coen brothers film about a struggling folksinger in early-'60s New York, features an unpleasant lead character who mooches off some friends and alienates others. \"Nebraska,\" directed by Alexander Payne (\"Sideways\"), stars Bruce Dern as a curmudgeonly old man convinced he's won a big cash prize; like all of Payne's films, it has plenty of bitter with the sweet. \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is a three-hour Martin Scorsese film about a crooked financial trader on a headlong rush to trouble. There's no \"Bridesmaids\"-like film in the bunch -- nor, for that matter, a \"Secret Life of Walter Mitty.\" Special coverage of Awards Season 2014 . 3) \"The Butler\" got shown the door. In the Screen Actors Guild nominations, announced Wednesday, \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" did surprisingly well, earning nominations for ensemble (the equivalent of best film) and performers Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. None of them were nominated for a Globe -- and this despite the fact that the Globes often appear to hand out nominations based as much on star power as quality. Sorry, Oprah: You'll have to be invited like any other guest. Also getting short shrift from the Hollywood Foreign Press: Scorsese, who missed out on a directing nod; \"August: Osage County,\" which picked up two acting nominations but nothing for film, director or screenplay; and Woody Allen, though two of his \"Blue Jasmine\" stars got nominated. Not that Woody would have shown -- the awards-show curmudgeon, who never goes to the Oscars either, will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award from the HFPA, but Diane Keaton is scheduled to accept on his behalf. 4) No SAG Award nomination? No problem! OK, so \"The Butler\" got stiffed by the Globes. Not so for \"Rush,\" which earned a nomination not only for Daniel Bruhl -- who did get a SAG nod -- but also for the film itself. And how about Kate Winslet? There's been little chatter about Jason Retman's \"Labor Day,\" but she earned a best actress (drama) nomination. Robert Redford also got tabbed. The venerable 77-year-old actor, who's a one-man show in \"All Is Lost,\" picked up a best actor nomination. His snub by the SAGs may have been Wednesday's biggest surprise. 5) Watch out for \"Gravity.\" Alfonso Cuaron's film has a spare screenplay and a small cast. Indeed, its lack of a true ensemble could have possibly hurt it with the SAGs. But Sandra Bullock got an acting nod (as she did from the SAGs), and the film also earned Globe nominations for drama, director Cuaron and its score. Oscarologists still consider it a front-runner for best picture, and the Globes did nothing to dispel that belief. Incidentally, for all the attention paid to the Globes, their real attraction is as a raucous, celebrity-studded party. The liquor flows freely and there's generally a loose, devil-may-care vibe from the winners. (No surprise -- this is the award that once gave Pia Zadora a \"new star of the year\" honor for the immortal film \"Butterfly.\") The hosts, once again, will be Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, so expect a good time -- and terrible singing. The Golden Globes will be broadcast on Sunday, January 12. The program will air on NBC. Keep up to date with the Awards tracker .",

        "article": "Baghdad (CNN) -- A spate of bombs exploded in Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 21 people and wounding 125 others, police said. The blasts -- six car bombs and three roadside explosions -- mainly targeted outdoor markets in Shiite neighborhoods, Baghdad police said. Overall violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. Yet such attacks continue as the 10-year anniversary of the U.S-led invasion of Iraq nears next month. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks. Recent attacks in Shiite areas have spread fear among Iraqis that sectarian warfare may ravage the country again. Sunnis demand that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected. Last month, at least 177 Iraqi civilians, soldiers and police officers were killed in attacks, according to figures compiled by Iraq's interior, defense and health ministries. The casualties were predominantly civilians, according to the ministries. The total does not include those killed in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region, which keeps its own death toll. Security has deteriorated since last December, when Sunni demonstrators in provinces such as Anbar and Mosul called for an end to what they considered second-class treatment. The protests were triggered when Iraqi security forces arrested several bodyguards of Finance Minister Rafie al-Essawi, a Sunni.",

        "article": "Floyd 'money' Mayweather reportedly laid down a whopping $5.9 million bet on Miami Heat winning last night's basketball game - and they did, earning him a cool $6.49 million profit. Boxing extraordinaire Mayweather - the highest earning athlete in the world - put down the bet on Game 7 between the Indiana Pacers and the Heat, Vegas Gambling Steam tweeted before the game. LeBron James' team were a seven-point favorite against the Pacers, and luckily for Mayweather, the team ended up destroying their rivals 99-76, doubling the sports star's money. Big bucks: Floyd Mayweather Jr., pictured left at a previous Miami Heat game and right boxing, reportedly put down a $5.9 million bet on Miami Heat to win last night's game and they did . Mayweather apparently made the eye-boggling bet just after he signed a six-fight $200 million with Showtime and agreed to fight Canelo Alvarez in September for some $40 million. The sports star is no stranger to gambling, and winning, but even for him the almost $6 million wager is extreme. Vegas Gambling Steam broke the news of the eye-boggling bet on Twitter. 'Good source from my #HeavyHitters Vegas crew alerted me that Floyd Mayweather has laid over $5,900,000 on Heat -7 tonight in Vegas,' the tweet read. Winners: Miami Heat forward Chris Andersen, center, raises the NBA Eastern Conference trophy after defeating the Indiana Pacers 99-76 in game 7 in their NBA basketball Eastern Conference finals playoff series .

'I . know that there have been people who walked into a casino and bet a . million dollars, but not on basketball. It was always the Super Bowl.' According to Vegas Gambling Steam, Mayweather had to spread his wagers across nine sportsbooks.

Salute: Miami Heat forward LeBron James, acknowledges the crowd after accepting the Eastern Conference Finals trophy after defeating the Indiana Pacers  following their NBA playoff basketball game at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida . 'I don't think that anybody's taking a six million dollar bet at one shot,' Eckstein said. 'You'd probably have to call (Vegas mogul) Steve Wynn personally for that.' Mayweather enjoys sharing his winning and losing tickets on Twitter, but he's yet to brag about picking the victorious team last night. Between August 2010 and and February 2012, Mayweather had a nearly flawless run, tweeting photographs of 46 betting slips, totaling $3,890,833 worth of bets, and 'every single one of them was a winner, netting the fighter a cool $3,938,722 in winnings,' according to a story on Grantland.com.",

        "article": "On a road jammed with traffic in Kabul is a hospital behind very high walls. There's a security checkpoint at the gate and once inside, the guards search all belongings -- checking every bag, opening every zipper and looking through the lens of our TV camera to make sure it's not a bomb. Inside the compound are single storey buildings clad in white paint. Cement pathways connect the low-rise structures that pave their way through a mini oasis. Trees and garden beds surround the complex. Brightly colored flowers sprout from the earth -- a stark contrast from the dry, dusty, arid landscape outside these four high walls. Vines grow up a patio awning where patients sit taking respite -- recovering from their injuries, all sustained through war. This is the Emergency Hospital -- an Italian-run facility funded by private donors. It treats only victims of the war in Afghanistan -- civilians and the Taliban alike. The hospital had its busiest month in August 2012 with casualties reaching the highest levels since this war began almost 12 years ago. Read more: NATO releases details of brazen attack on base . Recovering in one of the wards is 17-year-old Naweed Tanha. He was badly injured on September 8 when a teenage suicide bomber blew himself up outside ISAF Headquarters in Kabul. It was the 55th suicide bombing in Afghanistan this year. \"We were all selling bracelets in that place,\" explains Naweed, quietly sitting on a bench outside, happy to get out of the crammed hospital ward. His right hand is thickly bandaged after the explosion tore a chunk off his palm. His legs and back were also badly injured after being flung ten meters  by the force of the blast. \"I was with my friends -- we're all poor, innocent people. I was a few meters away getting some water from the nearby water hand pump and as I was returning the bang happened,\" Naweed says. \"By the time I opened my eyes I saw myself injured and saw bodies of my other friends laying on the ground. I started crying and running towards them when police stopped me. They put me in a car and brought me here to the hospital. \" Four were killed in the blast, including 14-year-old Khorshid Hawa and her 10-year-old sister Parwana. \"I am so upset for losing my friends,\" says Naweed, his eyes dark, his pupils bloodshot from crying. But he has no more tears to shed -- just hurt and anger oozes from his body. \"What kind of people would do this? Why are they continuing to do this? It is ruining our country and our future.\" Most of the kids were members of Skateistan -- a charity that teaches street kids how to skateboard while providing them with an education. They'd sell their wares in the morning, hustling bracelets, chewing gum and water to foreigners entering the heavily fortified ISAF compound. They'd then go off to school in the afternoon in an attempt to break this cycle of poverty. Read more: Karzai's choice for Afghan intelligence chief suspected of torture, trafficking . James Herzog, an American music teacher at the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, used to hang out with Khorshid and her gang of skateboarding friends on the weekend. \"She was strong and witty and full of edgy comebacks,\" he says with a sad smile on his face. \"She could stand up to any of the other street kid bullies and was always protecting the younger girls on the street. I loved spending my weekend afternoons with her and despite seeing her position in this life, I always left feeling extremely positive about this world.\" James lived just around the corner from the blast -- he arrived on the scene shortly after witnessing the carnage. The bodies of his young friends had been taken away but pools of blood covered the footpath next to one of Khorshid's chalk drawings on the pavement. \"She never ever asked me for money and rarely tried to sell me any trinkets. She usually wanted to practice English, and I often quizzed her little sister with multiplication questions. I loved the moments when I could convince Khorshid to sing a folk song for me as an unofficial audition for the music school. At the end of every 'hang,' we would share an apple or Pepsi while she would draw little designs on the street or walls.\" Paying tribute to his young Afghani friend, Herzog says she's left a huge imprint on his life. \"Khorshid was one of those kids who sent life lessons back to the rest of the world through the foreigners who were lucky enough to know her. Her setting may have been a dusty street corner with occasional packs of aggressive dogs, nervous foreign soldiers, unforgiving barbed wire and concrete walls, but her beauty and positivity transcended all of it.\" Back at the hospital, 15-year-old Mohammad Ilyas sits in a wheel chair -- both of legs are bandaged up. His mother has tied a piece of brightly colored material around his wrist as a good luck charm. \"We were close to the blast. I was very close to it -- almost two meters away. I didn't see the suicide bomber myself, but other people were saying that he was around 13 years old and he had a school bag too. After the explosion took place, I thought somebody had shot me in the leg but after I opened my eyes and saw my friends on the ground, I realized that it was an explosion. \"I saw their bodies. I saw the body flesh of the suicide bomber, which was spread every where -- only his legs were left lying on the ground.\" Mohammad is about to undergo surgery on his legs. Doctors are telling him that he may never get full movement back, but the news doesn't seem to register. \"I am very upset about losing my friends.

        "article": "By . Nick Harris . Andy Murray's fourth-round opponent Kevin Anderson has been practising with his former coach Ivan Lendl - but the Scot is confident Lendl will not have spilled any secrets. Reigning champion Murray, 27, plays South African Anderson on Monday for a place in the quarter-finals. Anderson has an American wife, Kelsey, and lives in Florida. He met Lendl by chance at the Crandon Park tennis club in Key Biscayne and the pair spent time on court together. Lendl was Murray's coach from the end of 2011 until March this year and helped him finally win a Grand Slam - guiding him to the US Open title in 2012, the Wimbledon title last year and Olympic gold. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's verdict of day six with Whitwell and Fraser . Upbeat: Andy Murray has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry . 'Ivan loves playing tennis, he hits balls all the time when he is over in Miami,' said Murray of Lendl and Anderson meeting up. 'That doesn't surprise me in the slightest.' Murray lost four Slam finals before finally winning his first. Lendl also lost four Slam finals before winning the first of eight he won in his career. He gave the Wimbledon champion valuable insight into how to become a winner. Murray insists that Lendl hitting with Anderson won't have helped\u00a0 him. 'You can't compare practising with Ivan to playing against me, it's completely different,' he said. The journey towards a second straight Wimbledon title takes Murray into the land of giants this week - literally and figuratively. He has breezed through his first three matches against low-ranked small fry with straight-sets wins taking a total of five hours. On Monday he will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply, facing 6ft 8in Anderson, the world No 18. And if he clears that hurdle, Bulgaria's dangerous world No 13 Grigor Dimitrov will probably await in the quarter-final, followed by world No 2 Novak Djokovic and world No 1 Rafa Nadal after that. Happy days: Murray has been able to take time out with actor Ricky Gervais . The contrast with last year is huge. As he sought to break the 77-year Fred Perry hoodoo, Murray did not face a single player from inside the top 20 before the final. And he knows that an easy first week this year carries a risk of complacency, although he insists he is ready for a stiffer challenge. 'It could become a problem if you are not mentally prepared for the matches to get more challenging,' he said yesterday. 'If you just think everything will be the same as it was in the first week and you are playing well enough, then you are complacent. I'm aware against Kevin things will be a lot tougher. There are going to be harder moments in the second week. 'Last year I was coming to the tournament having not played at the French Open and missed quite a bit of tennis. Because of the grass it was important for me to get a good start in the tournament because maybe physically I wasn't in my best shape. This year I don't see that being a problem.' Murray has faced Anderson twice. He won their first meeting back in 2010 at the Australian Open then lost at the Montreal Masters the following year. He wasn't a Grand Slam winner at that stage, of course. Murray has experience of playing\u00a0 tall players; he has met Croatia's 6ft 11in Ivo Karlovic five times, including on grass, and won all five and played the USA's 6ft 10in John Isner twice and won both. 'Anderson doesn't serve as big as them but he is probably better from the back of the court,' said Murray. 'He has a better return game than Isner and Karlovic. There might be more chances to break but equally he will return better and make more balls when you are serving. Up for it: Murray will see the gradient of the challenge rise steeply, facing 6ft 8in Kevin Anderson . 'I'd say Anderson is more mobile than Karlovic. Most of the big guys now who play from the back of the court are pretty good movers.' Murray is one of the finest returners in the game but he will do some preparatory work with one of his coaching team, Danny Vallverdu, on facing Anderson's serve. 'He's obviously serving different angles at different heights, so the ball's bouncing up much higher. I'll have Danny serve at me\u00a0 from just behind the service line. That's really the only thing I do differently.' The ease of Murray's progress means he spent less time on court than his key rivals as he overcame David Goffin, Blaz Rola and then, on Friday evening, Roberto Bautista Agut. With new coach Amelie Mauresmo\u00a0 helping him maintain his on-court composure, Murray has looked quietly confident, certainly calm. 'I'm in familiar surroundings. That's going to make you feel more comfortable. Just being at home, staying in your own bed, having all of your friends and family around you - you're going to feel more relaxed away from the court. 'The nerves and the pressure here are also different to other tournaments for me, as well. It's probably greater here than it is at the other Grand Slams. But I enjoy pressure. I like feeling nervous. I'm not scared of that feeling. 'I felt like I've played my best tennis when I've been under pressure. I obviously love playing here.'",

The nearly one-mile long attraction, which opened last Sunday, whizzes, dips and dives through the Ourimbah State Forest at TreeTop Adventure Park in Central Coast, Australia. The rollercoaster, called Crazy Rider Xtreme, starts 60ft above ground then zigzags through 40 obstacles, around 360-degree loops and in and out of 40 slaloms. Scroll down for video . Longest rollercoaster zip line: Crazy Rider Xtreme opened last Sunday and is nearly a mile long . Hold on tight: The five-minute ride\u00a0starts 60ft above ground and then zigzags through 40 obstacles . It's also the country's first tree-based rollercoaster zip line. The marathon ride takes five minutes to complete and is three times as long as any other curved zip wire, surpassing Forever Florida in the US which previously held the title. The TreeTop Adventure Park website says: 'Combining the thrill and suspense of a rollercoaster with the flying sensations of zip lines, the Crazy Rider is an exhilarating experience open to a large range of age and abilities.' No getting off: The attraction is three times as long as any other curved \u00a0rollercoaster zip wire . 'It is not really about the speed but more about gravity, especially in the turns. The acceleration and deceleration is what makes the ride thrilling,' Sandrine Gaymard, the owner of the park, told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Zip lines usually travel in a straight line but we thought it would be incredible to build some to go around the trees, up and down, and even with 360-degree loops to really ramp up the fun factor,' she said. The\u00a0TreeTop Adventure Park has a shorter tree-based zip line that is 330m long . If you want to try something a little less heart racing, you can strap into the Pioneer zip line at the same site, which is nearly 1,100ft long. Sophisticated high-wire technology developed by the park owners and tree-ride maker Ecoline means the attractions allow trees to grow around them unrestricted. An independent arborist is also employed to monitor the health of the trees. Stomach churning:\u00a0Sophisticated high-wire technology allow trees to grow around the ride unrestricted . There are moments when the ride speeds up and others when it slows down to let riders enjoy the views . Bird's eye view: One reviewer described the experience as 'heart in mouth' and a 'monumental achievement' One online reviewer, 'Scott from Central Coast', wrote: 'Crazy Rider is a monumental achievement for the Central Coast. Twists, turns, heart in your mouth moments all interspersed with cruisey sections and squeals of joy.' While it's the longest rollercoaster\u00a0zip line, Crazy Rider certainly isn't the longest zip line in the world. That honour goes to Italy's 1.3-mile-long Volo dell'Angelo (the Angel Flight) which travels in a straight line at speeds of up to 74 miles per hour and is said to be the world's highest continuous zip wire as well. Eye of the Jaguar, in Peru's Sacred Valley, is almost as long and reaches speeds of up to 68 miles per hour. Zip World, at Penrhyn Quarry in Bethesda, North Wales,  has the Big Zipper, which can reach 100 miles per hour over a distance of more than a mile.",

        "article": "In a stadium holding no fans, Manchester City will face a player who made little noise during an 18-month spell at rivals United. But Zoran Tosic has proved he is worth shouting about since establishing himself at CSKA Moscow. Manuel Pellegrini, in desperate need of victory, should be wary of the danger he poses. Tosic joined United aged 21 in January 2009 when Sir Alex Ferguson agreed to pay Partizan Belgrade \u00a37million. He arrived as an exciting talent having scored 18 goals in 61 games for one of the biggest teams in his native Serbia. Midfielder Zoran Tosic, 27, played just 79 minutes for Manchester United after signing for \u00a37million . But his career at Old Trafford never really sparked into life. There were only five appearances, all from the bench, totaling 79 minutes in a United shirt. Tosic made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup . He should get more in CSKA\u2019s Champions League clash against City at the Arena Khimki alone. There were promising spells for United\u2019s reserve team but the Premier League was initially too great a step up. Cristiano Ronaldo also presented a sizeable blockade to first-team progression. Having made two appearances in the Premier League, two in the League Cup, and one in the FA Cup, Tosic went on loan to Cologne in Germany. He enjoyed his time so much he wanted regular football immediately. When that was not on offer at United, he decided to leave for CSKA. He has been a tremendous success. Now into his fifth season, he has scored 33 goals in 150 games and is a trickery winger of great threat to City\u2019s defence. Tosic is reveling in his role as a key figure in CSKA\u2019s side, but admits to feeling he may have left United too soon. \u2018It all happened really quickly as I played for just 18 months with Partizan Belgrade,\u2019 Tosic said. \u2018We won the league and the cup and there was a period when it seemed like I was scoring in every match. \u2018It was at that point I signed for Manchester United. It was such an exciting moment to go there and to meet Sir Alex. Tosic played against City last season in CSKA's Champions League defeat at the Etihad Stadium . Tosic in action for Serbia against Australia in Melbourne - he has 59 caps for his country . Age: 27 Position: Attacking midfield . Career path . Buducnost Banatski Dvor (2005-06) Banat Zrenjanin (2006-07) Partizan (2007-09) Manchester United (2009-10) Cologne (2010, loan) CSKA Moscow (2010-) International . Serbia 59 caps, nine goals . \u2018I had grown up as a United fan so to be working for the man who had brought so much success to the club was just unbelievable. \u2018However, there is a big difference between the Serbian and English league and when I arrived in Manchester I discovered I was not yet ready for that level. \u2018I spoke with Sir Alex many times and he kept telling me I had quality and just had to keep working hard. But I wanted to play more games so went to Cologne in Germany on loan and had a great six months there. \u2018When I came back to Manchester I was expecting to play more games for United but it didn\u2019t happen. In the end I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to get the chance I felt I deserved so decided to change club. \u2018Even now I am always thinking about that moment. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been so quick and should have worked longer to show Sir Alex. \u2018Maybe I should have stayed and fought for my place. This was Man United after all.\u2019 Zoran challenges Scotland's Paul Dixon in a World Cup 2014 qualifier at Hampden Park in 2012 . The Manchester City squad brave the freezing temperatures in Moscow on Monday night in training . Manager Manuel Pellegrini\u00a0says the empty stadium for the Champions League match will not benefit Man City .",

        "article": "By . Emily Payne . A hospital accused of making 'serious errors' in the care of a child has become the subject of an independent inquiry. Luke Jenkins, from Cardiff, was admitted to Bristol Children\u2019s Hospital for routine heart surgery in April 2012. But the seven-year-old, who was expected to make a full recovery, died from a cardiac arrest. Inquiry: Luke Jenkins, celebrating his 1st birthday at the Children's Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. He died six years later during routine surgery . In . November 2013, a coroner recorded a narrative conclusion, but his . family maintain the hospital could have done more to save . him. Now . an independent inquiry has been launched into the children\u2019s cardiac . unit, which has been accused of making 'serious errors' in Luke's . treatment. The Bristol Review into cardiac services at the hospital, which was opened yesterday, aims to gather evidence from aggrieved families who claim they have suffered at the hands of staff. The hospital was accused of a catalogue of neglect and mistreatment of babies and children with heart problems. Last year, it emerged that around 10 families were believed to be taking legal action against the trust, including seven whose children died following treatment at the hospital. Luke\u2019s mother Faye Valentine, who has campaigned for improvements in quality of care, believes her son\u2019s death was preventable. She said: 'Nothing will bring Luke back - we just want to seek justice. Grieving: Luke's parents Steve Jenkins and Faye Valentine believe that their son Luke's death was preventable . 'It feels like we have been pushing for . this for a long time, but we are hopeful something good will come of it. We cannot be negative about it. 'All we want the hospital to do is accept they were wrong in the treatment of my son. My main concern is making the hospital a safe place.' Launching the inquiry in Bristol, Eleanor Grey QC, who has been commissioned by NHS England to conduct the review, said confidentiality and support for witnesses would be an 'important principle' of its work. She said: 'We won\u2019t be having any public hearings. We want witnesses to feel as free and as well-supported as possible when they give their evidence. 'They will be free to bring a friend or a trade union representative, for example. We will also be offering independent, professional emotional support for participants, provided free under the NHS.' Ms Grey said the review will examine care provided to children with congenital heart disease and the experiences of parents and carers from March 2010 until the present day. Luke Jenkins, pictured with his grandad Paul Valentine, died following a routine heart operation . It will look at all the respective cardiac services delivered, both in Bristol and through clinics closer to families\u2019 homes. Ms Grey . said March 2010 was the date when new quality and safety standards were . set but events before this date 'may well be relevant'. The experiences of all potential witnesses will be valuable, she said, whether they are positive, negative or mixed. Professor Sir Ian Kennedy QC, who specialises in the law and ethics of healthcare, will act as consultant advisor. Sir . Ian was chairman of a far-reaching inquiry into children\u2019s heart . surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, which was published in . 2001. The . report made recommendations for a safer, more accountable health . service. Ms Grey is a former counsel to the Bristol Royal Infirmary . inquiry. A . spokesman for University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We . welcome this review and look forward to assisting as it gathers the . views of patients and families over the coming months. 'It\u2019s . important that families who wish to share their views on the care . provided by our children\u2019s heart unit can do so easily and through a . variety of accessible channels. 'We . will make sure that Eleanor Grey QC and her team have full and . unfettered access to the information they need and our expert clinical . staff, managers and members of the trust board will be available to talk . to the panel and answer their questions during the course of the . review.'",

        "article": "London (CNN) -- You could call it the humanoid robot's more curvacious cousin. Slithering into confined spaces, tackling tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans, the Snake-arm robot can \"reach the unreachable\" say its UK inventors, OC Robotics. Managing director Rob Buckingham and technical director Andrew Graham developed their first prototype in 2001 from their base in Bristol, England, and they've been perfecting the technology ever since. Today, with clients in the nuclear sector and others queuing up for a demonstration, the hard work is beginning to pay off. The technical challenge has been finding a way to channel energy into the snake-arm, Buckingham says. \"Just like the human arm, the big muscles that drive them are actually mounted on the back and tendons link the muscles to the joints,\" Buckingham said. \"Basically, we've taken that principle to an extreme and use wire ropes as tendons and all the motors (actuators) that control the arm are at the base of the robot,\" he added. Made of steel, these \"wire ropes\" transfer the actuators' mechanical power into the snake-arm, where a series of articulating links create a sinuous movement. They can be made to various lengths, but the width is crucial to the robot's functional efficiency. \"Our rule of thumb is 30 to one (a length 30 times the diameter) is good for a robot that can do quite a lot of work,\" Buckingham said. The arms themselves are delivery mechanisms, Buckingham says, for a range of tools which can be fitted to the tip. Video cameras, lights, tack welding, cutting, gripping and swabbing gear are just a few of the tools OC Robotics has built, and all can be routed through the snake-arm's hollow core. Both the arm and the tools are controlled by a human operator who uses nothing more complicated than a computer screen and a control pad borrowed from a video games console. Test your skills on the Snake-Arm Simulator . \"You're not removing the person completely, but they are working much more safely. That's what we've seen in the nuclear sector,\" Buckingham said. In 2004, OC carried out a complex maintenance job on a reactor in Sweden and last year, it successfully inspected a reactor in Ontario, Canada. \"It's getting to the stage where our technology is quite mature,\" Buckingham said, \"and we're looking for partners and customers who will actually grab hold of the opportunity.\" His wishes may soon be granted. Earlier this year the company demonstrated a 2.5 meter snake-arm fitted with swabbing, scooping and radiological probe tools to Sellafield, the UK's primary nuclear decommissioning company. \"I have to admit that when I went down to see it I was a lot more impressed than I expected to be,\" said Phil Reeve, head of strategy and technical for Sellafield's decommissioning directorate. \"We have places which ideally we don't want to put people into and we don't want to make big openings either -- we have situations where we want to know what is on the other side of a four-feet concrete wall,\" Reeve said. \"If we've got something that can go in and is sufficiently dextrous to maneuver around obstacles and can get out again then it potentially has some big advantages,\" he added. The savings could run into millions of dollars, Reeve believes, but clearly there are more important things at stake. \"If we can reduce the number of times that somebody has to put on a plastic suit in hazardous environments then there's a huge benefit in that which goes beyond (money),\" Reeve said. Buckingham is hopeful the company can help with the cleanup operation at the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. An offer has been made he says, but as yet, no reply has been received. In the meantime, other industrial partners are being sought. Aviation giants Airbus and Boeing are looking at how the technology might aid inspection of the confined spaces inside wings and fuselages during the manufacturing process. Demonstrations have also been requested by both U.S. and UK government defense agencies into how the snake-arm could enhance remote vehicle inspection. Doctors and patients may also be beneficiaries in the future too as OC Robotics works on a snake-arm which could one day perform natural orifice surgery. \"Our prototype signals a direction of travel and is a milestone towards exploring a new surgical paradigm,\" Buckingham said.",

        "article": "Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Rebels seized an international airport in Yemen Sunday as a U.N. envoy warned that the country was at \"the edge of civil war.\" Houthi militants took over the airport in Taiz as they swept through the city and surrounding province, two officials with the Taiz provincial government said. One civilian was killed and 82 others wounded when the rebels fired at local residents protesting their presence, the officials said. The rebels have also seized security and intelligence buildings in Taiz and set up checkpoints in the area, the officials said. Taiz, about 390 kilometers (240 miles) south of Sanaa, is Yemen's cultural capital. The rebels -- Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- surrounded the presidential palace in January. Yemen's President and his Cabinet resigned days later. Ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi says his resignation wasn't valid and maintains that he remains the country's leader. In a statement Sunday, the United Nations Security Council backed Hadi, calling for all sides to end armed hostilities and work out differences at the negotiating table. \"Peaceful dialogue is the only way forward,\" said Jamal Benomar, the U.N.'s special adviser on Yemen. But he gave a dire assessment of the current situation, saying the country is in a \"rapid downward spiral\" and at \"the edge of civil war.\" This isn't the first time the U.N. Security Council has weighed in on the mounting tensions. Last month the council slammed the rebels for taking over democratic institutions and holding officials under house arrest. But so far, it seems calls for calm from around the world have done little to quell the violence. Last week, a Yemeni jet commanded by the Houthi fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. That same day, Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, leaving at least 13 people dead in the clashes, Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour said. There are growing concerns that terror groups such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS could take advantage of the chaos to mount attacks and spread their reach. Bombings at two mosques in Sanaa last week killed at least 137 people and wounded hundreds more. ISIS claimed responsibility in a statement posted on a site that has published previous statements from the group. On Saturday the State Department said the U.S. military had pulled its remaining personnel out of Yemen due to the deteriorating security situation.

        "article": "Jailed:\u00a0Matthew Parkhouse was sentenced to 20 months in prison for stealing money from customer accounts while working at a Natwest call centre . A bank worker who stole a fortune from elderly customers after taking their account details over the phone was caught out when his own account rocketed from \u00a38 to \u00a336,000. NatWest telephone advisor Matthew Parkhouse asked a string of account holders for the security digits on the backs of their cards when he didn't need them for legitimate banking purposes. He secretly noted the numbers down and then used them to make payments of thousands into a business account he held. Had the scam succeeded, Parkhouse would have got away with over \u00a350,000 - instead he has been jailed for 20 months. Manchester Crown Court heard how he was employed at the bank\u2019s call centre in Manchester between April 2012 and March 2014 - where he was responsible for dealing with customer accounts queries over the phone . He was rumbled in December 2013 after his own bank - Barclays - became suspicious that his savings had shot up. Parkhouse, 30, of Hulme, Manchester had set up the Barclays account in the name of 'Megabyte Software', two months before he began the frauds. Prosecutor Lindsay Thomas said: 'It transpired that part of that agreement with Barclays involved allowing customers to process card payments without them being present - so long as all the card details, including the three digits on the back of the card - were presented.' When Barclays examined the transactions they found out they had come from six different bank cards - all issued to NatWest, where Parkhouse worked. Two days after Barclays first became suspicious, Parkhouse went into the Stockport branch of Barclays and withdrew \u00a36,000 in cash. Parkhouse blamed another 'rogue' employee for the frauds when quizzed by bosses, but he was the only member of staff to have accessed all six of the victims' accounts and transcripts revealed he had asked for their security digits. Fraudulent activity: The 30-year-old was employed at the bank\u2019s call centre in Manchester between April 2012 and March 2014 and would ask account holders for their three digit security pin without a legitimate reason . He later admitted six fraud charges and one charge of converting criminal property. Kate Harney, defending, said the offence had 'naive' characteristics, adding: 'This is a young man who set up a business account in his own name, to his own address, and there was a very clear audit trail within the bank. 'This is not a young man who had thought this through.' Miss Harney said the breakdown of his parents' marriage had caused difficulties for his mother and that Parkhouse had been hoping to help her with the cash, but ended up doing 'nothing to assist' her. Sentencing for the 'gross breach of trust' Recorder Suzanne Goddard QC said Parkhouse had received a good education and had 'thrown away the opportunities' given to him. Sentencing: Speaking at Manchester Crown Court, above,\u00a0Recorder Suzanne Goddard QC said Parkhouse had received a good education and had 'thrown away the opportunities' given to him . Detective Constable Laura Watson, of GMP's Fraud Investigation Team, said: 'Parkhouse was employed by NatWest and placed in a position of trust, dealing with customer accounts. 'He abused this trust and stole a large amount of money from mainly elderly customers and used his position for his own gain. 'Both NatWest and Barclays were quick to act and worked in partnership with the police to help us to prosecute this man. I hope today's sentence serves the message that you will be caught and you will be prosecuted.'",

        "article": "Peter Lynagh went without sex for an entire year after his housemate bet him $2000 he couldn't . A Melbourne man who gave up sex for a year gained much more than he bargained for when a bet with a friend took on a life of its own. In late 2012 Peter Lynagh joked with his housemate he was fed up with the single life, which revolved around late nights partying and one night stands. 'I was going to give up women and sex... He (my housemate) said I couldn't even go a week, then this got me wound up even more,' Mr Lynagh told the Daily Mail Australia. From there what started as a $2000 bet between the pair grew to more than $50,000 being raised over the course of the year after a Facebook post 'went nuts' and Pete's Chastity for Charity was born. 'I had a flash of inspiration that I could give that money to the charity, make it bigger than me,' he said. The rules were for an entire year from the 1st of January 2013, Mr Lynagh, 33 at the time, wasn't allowed to jump into bed with anyone at all, though kissing was passable. He pledged to give all funds raised to Australian charity Free to Shine, an organisation which aims to save young Cambodian girls from the sex trade and instead educate them, and described the whole experience as 'a roller-coaster emotionally.' However an early lapse meant he came very close to breaking the ban in the first few months, and admitted the woman he was with was the one who had to put on the brakes. The Melbourne man set up a Facebook page called Pete's Chastity for Charity and raised more than $50K for a charity that supports children in Cambodia . 'No one thought I could do it... I nearly came really close to breaking it, I started seeing a girl and I don't know why,' he revealed. 'I think she was just enjoying the fact I wasn't trying to get in her pants.' 'That was a turning point, I just said I really had to take it seriously.' Mr Lynagh described the following months as a real journey of self-discovery, and along the way he found there were many parts of himself he wasn't entirely happy with. He focused his energy into other aspects of his life, started his own business and took a trip to Cambodia in September to see where the money raised from his abstinence was going. In September of last year he travelled overseas to work with the kids and see where the money was going . With his help the charity was able to employ extra workers on the ground and double the amount of girls it looked after. 'Once I'd seen what was happening, it was really humbling,' Mr Lynagh said. From here, he has aspirations to start a charity of his own, but for now has thrown his support behind The Big Umbrella project, a joint effort with The Father Bob Maguire Foundation with promotes anti-slavery and rehabilitation programs in Nepal. Earlier this year he made the trip to Kathmandu, and has just launched a fundraiser to deck out these kids, many of whom are orphans previously living on the streets, in brand new soccer gear. He has plans to start a charity of his own, and although would never give up sex for that long again wants to do something equally as 'crazy' When asked if he would ever go without sex for so long again, Mr Lynagh said he would be open to be doing something similar, but struggled to name something more difficult to give up. 'I don't think I would do no sex again for a year, I would like to something else crazy and out there and different.' 'If anyone can think of anything else crazy or quirky, I'm open to suggestions.'",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Juana Vidal yearns to reunite with her undocumented immigrant son and his family, but she fears the stakes involved. Her son, Elesban Vidal, his wife and their two daughters will join as many as 125 families that will try to cross the California-Mexico border on Monday and demand that U.S. officials allow them back in the country to join with their U.S. relatives through a humanitarian visa or asylum. Most, if not all, of the 125 families had earlier lived in the United States as undocumented immigrants, including some who were earlier deported. The dramatic maneuver by so many families is designed to renew attention to how the U.S. immigration system painfully breaks up families when members are deported for being undocumented immigrants. The families will stage their event on the Mexico side of the Otay Mesa point of entry, between San Diego and Tijuana. \"I'm very worried. I'm nervous. I sometimes can't sleep because I'm thinking something could happen to them,\" Juana Vidal said. That's the feeling Juana Vidal has had since she found out a few weeks ago that her son and his family will be attempting to return from Puebla, Mexico, where they have been living the past two years. \"He's afraid but says he will try to see if he's able to come back,\" Juana Vidal, 56, said in an interview in her Los Angeles home. She spends her time caring for her other U.S.-born grandchildren. She will anxiously wait on the U.S. side of the Otay Mesa crossing to see if her son and his family will be admitted. Her son and his wife had been living in the United States as undocumented immigrants, but they were never arrested and voluntarily returned to Mexico after he couldn't find a decent job. Their two daughters, however, were born in the United States and are American citizens, and the Vidal family hopes the citizen status of the two girls, ages 3 and 5, will help their visa applications so that grandparents can be reunited with grandchildren and their parents. Elesban Vidal also wants to unite his family with his siblings, who live in the United States. The family won't find Monday's quest easy, experts say. The event is part of the \"Bring them Home\" campaign led by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance (NIYA), which calls itself \"an undocumented youth-led network\" of groups that tries to reunite families. \"It's incredible that we have to rely on actions like this,\" said Luis Nolasco, a member of NIYA. \"There are so many families that want a way to come back. The reality should be that they should be able to come back an easier way and it's not happening,\" Nolasco says everyday hundreds of families are being separated under President Barack Obama's administration. Almost 2 million undocumented immigrants have been deported since the President took office five years ago, he said. Monday's action will be the third and largest event staged so far by the alliance. Deportations: Missing parents, scared kids . \"What happens is people will present themselves at the border and will be asked to be let back into the country because this is their home for lot of them,\" Nolsaco said. Immigrants who have not been able to obtain a visa for entry can apply for an alternative visa known as humanitarian parole, according to the Department of Homeland Security website. These types of visas allow foreign residents to come into the country based on their particular situation. However, immigration lawyers say humanitarian parole isn't an easy document to obtain and that it's granted case-by-case. \"It's a benefit that's given to individuals that want to come to the United States, generally for emergency reasons. It's applied either with United States Citizenship Immigration Services or with U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the Border,\" said Nelson Castillo, a California-based immigration lawyer. Castillo said humanitarian parole is granted to those with true emergency or medical situations where they have to explain to an officer at the border why they want to be received by the United States. \"Generally they have to prove that they have tried to obtain a way to come in lawfully into the United States and they will have to plead out their case to what is the valid reason, the emergency,\" Castillo said. Long-lost son, 37, to finally see mother after 35 years abroad . The National Immigrant Youth Alliance says these families have the right to come back to this country, as many have children who are U.S. citizens. \"They lived here, they grew up here, and studied here. This is their community and this is their home and they don't recognize Mexico as their home country. Just because they were born there doesn't mean it's their home,\" said Nolasco. The alliance's other two efforts to reunite families involved nine young adults and 30 young adults -- all of them who once lived in the United States as undocumented immigrants but had left the country for one reason or another, including through deportation. Those two groups used the current political coinage of \"Dreamers\" to describe themselves -- that is, young immigrants in the United States without documentation. Dreamer is a moniker taken after an acronym of immigration reform legislation. \"The first run had nine Dreamers, second round had 30 and this time we are including families and parents in this round,\" Nolasco said. In the first two rounds, U.S. immigration officials detained all the participants and then released them, the alliance said. The majority obtained approval to stay temporarily in the United States and are awaiting for their day before an immigration judge, who will determine their fate. The Vidal family is nervous about the alliance's latest effort. Elesban Vidal, 32, was undocumented, like his parents, when they brought him to the United States at age 6. The family lived in Southern California near Compton, where Juana Vidal raised all five of her children. They attended Los Angeles schools and consider the United States their home country. But Juana Vidal said Elesban returned to Mexico two years ago because he couldn't find a job and he thought he could find more opportunity in Mexico. That didn't happen, the mother said. Her son didn't qualify for the Obama initiative called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program because he didn't meet all the requirements that would have allowed him temporary permission to remain in the states, the mother said. \"He told me the situation is hard, very hard\" in Mexico, Juana Vidal said. \"He can't get ahead, sometimes there's days he has a job and there's other days he doesn't and he tries to get by. But he regrets he left.\" A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform . Obama said he can't stop deportation of immigrants, but maybe he can .",

The teenager who watched her legs get severed at the knees while she attempted to jump aboard a moving freight train today revealed four months on that she \u2018clearly thought\u2019 she was about to die. Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three male friends in September in Longmont. The student, who was 17 at the time, told MSNBC on Friday that she has much to be thankful for and \u2018life doesn\u2019t end\u2019 now. But she will \u2018never be able to forget this horrible mistake that I made\u2019. Scroll down for video . Recovering: Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three male friends in September in Longmont . TV appearance: Anna Beninati, pictured centre, with her mother Debbie, left, was interviewed on MSNBC's Today show by presenter Ann Curry . \u2018I remember looking down at my leg . dragging on the ground, looking at the wheels and how fast they were going,\u2019 she told MSNBC. \u2018I remember looking down there and thinking\u2026 what have I . done? \u2018I felt my femur snap,\u2019 she added. \u2018I . remember thinking clearly that I was about to die. I\u2019m going to pay for . it for the rest of my life. I will never be able to forget this horrible . mistake that I made.\u2019 She remembered thinking for \u2018several . minutes before I even ran for the train\u2019 that something was going to go . wrong and it was a bad idea. \u2018I went for it anyway,\u2019 she told MSNBC. \u2018I\u2019m paying for it\u2019. Anna said she is extremely grateful . for the support of her family since the incident, although she was . \u2018angry\u2019 and had a \u2018hard time\u2019 soon after the incident while she came to . terms with what happened. Getting along: Anna said she is extremely grateful for the support of her family since the incident, although she was 'angry' and had a 'hard time' soon after the incident while she came to terms with what happened . Sports: Anna, who has since been studying online courses at CSU, has even been skiing with Wasatch Adaptive Sports in Utah and is intending to compete with a mono-ski in a tournament in March . The student, who had train hopped . almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath the steel . wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed under the 118-car . train last autumn. 'I remember thinking clearly that I was about to die. I\u2019m going to pay for it for the rest of my life' Anna Beninati . She remembered being under the train . for up to six seconds, reported the Longmont Times-Call, thinking to . herself immediately after: 'A: What do I do now? B: What did I just do . to myself?\u2019 The four friends had visited Denver on . Labor Day weekend and they had been given a ride by one of the young . men\u2019s fathers to Longmont on the way back to CSU, reported the Longmont . Times-Call. But the father was unaware of the . group\u2019s plan to jump aboard a train from there to Fort Collins. Anna . said their idea was quite common and the railway goes through the . university campus. Wheelchair: Two employees at Longmont United Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured by Anna along with others at a ceremony on Saturday . Freight locomotive: The student, who had train hopped almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath the train's steel wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed . The student had just seen one friend . make it onto the train and another slip but roll away to safety. She . decided to go for it, despite concerns she \u2018might not fare so well\u2019. 'I remember looking down there and thinking\u2026 what have I done?' Anna Beninati . One of her friends, Charlie Hamilton, . 25, a former Army medic, pulled her from underneath the train and two . hospital staff, who were stopped at a rail crossing, ran over to help . him begin first aid. The employees at Longmont United . Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured along with . others at a ceremony earlier this month, reported the Longmont . Times-Call. \u2018I never would have made it this far . if it weren't for these guys,\u2019 Anna said she realised when she turned 18 . on Christmas Eve last month.

        "article": "(CNN) -- Hundreds of Somalis marched through the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Monday, protesting against Al-Shabaab militants. The protesters -- mostly women and children, along with traditional warriors wearing white clothes and armed with spears and wooden shields -- chanted slogans denouncing the al Qaeda-inspired group. It was only the nation's second public demonstration against Al-Shabaab, which controls much of southern Somalia. It came a few days after the militant group destroyed tombs of revered Sufi clerics. The demonstration was staged in a government-controlled area of the city and was guarded by government forces, according to Yusuf Mohamed, who works for Shabelle Radio in Mogadishu. \"People were really disturbed by the move of Al-Shabaab to destroy the tombs of the revered sheikhs of Ahlu Sunna\" said Mohyadin Hassan Afrah, who leads a civil society umbrella group in Mogadishu. The protesters shouted slogans of support for the U.N.-backed government, observers said. Al-Shabaab follows the strict Saudi Arabian-inspired Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, rather than the Sufi Islam of many Somalis. \"We call for a holy war against them,\" said Sheikh Abdulkadir Somow, from the Sufi Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama group, which recently signed a deal with the government in neighboring Ethiopia. Some of the demonstrators carried posters with slogan such as \"Down and defeat to Al-Shabaab,\" observers said. They also carried slogans to support the transitional government such as \"Support Peace and Government.\" Last year, nearly 100 students came out in anger to the streets of Mogadishu in protest of Al-Shabaab after a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a graduation ceremony in the capital, killing more than 20 people, including four government ministers, doctors, teachers, students and journalists.",

        "article": "Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik used dum-dum bullets - which explode inside the body and often kill their targets instantly - on his deadly rampage around the idyllic holiday island of Utoya. The revelation by a surgeon comes as these incredible photographs emerge of children using mattresses to barricade themselves into their rooms. Eyewitnesses have described how the mass-murderer was 'calm and collected' during his spree, and and explained how they pretended to play dead to escape death. Terrified victims, aged between 15 and . 25, hid in buildings, crouched behind trees and lay among dead bodies. Others pretended to be dead . while some dived into freezing waters to escape Utoya island, north west of Oslo. Terrified victims posted this picture on Facebook after they barricaded themselves in a building on the island . Idyllic: An aerial view of Utoya Island, Norway, taken a day before the shootings . One young couple even hid in a freezer . for two hours while frantically trying to contact friends and family. Other witnesses said Breivik 'shot the cutest girl first' and would laugh and shout during the killing spree. Erlend Fosseida Selre, 19, said he was . watching TV coverage of the bombing in the country's capital, Oslo, . when the shooting started. 'We could hear shots and speaking from the floor outside. We thought it was the gunman walking around. 'We decided to stay until someone came to open the door, and prayed it would not be the gunman,' he told the Sunday Telegraph. Survivor Prableen Kaur, the deputy . leader of the AUF, the ruling Labour party's youth wing, said she was . talking to friends when she heard the first shots and immediately texted . her mum to say she was OK. And the chief surgeon at a hospital treating victims of Norway's camp massacre said the killer used special bullets designed to disintegrate inside the body and cause maximum internal damage. Dr Colin Poole, head of surgery at Ringriket Hospital in Honefoss north west of Oslo, said surgeons treating 16 gunshot victims have recovered no full bullets. He said: 'These bullets more or less exploded inside the body. These bullets inflicted internal damage that's absolutely horrible.' Ballistics experts say so-called dum-dum bullets also are lighter in weight and can be fired with greater accuracy over varying distances. They commonly are used by air marshals on aeroplanes and hunters of small animals. Poole, a surgeon for 26 years at the hospital, said the bullets were 'hyper-fragmentable' and produced confusing pictures on X-rays. 'It's caused us all kinds of extra problems in dealing with the wounds they cause, with very strange trajectories. The effect they cause inside the body is like a thousand pin pricks.' At first a number of people thought it . was a joke but soon realised the reality of the situation when Breivik . began chasing his victims down. Miss Kaur said the killer shot a . number of people around her. Desperate to live, she pretended she was . dead and lay ontop of another body for more than an hour. Lethal: Dum-dum bullet are more deadly than normal ammunition as they leave a larger exit wound . Eventually a local man with a tiny . boat came to her rescue and she was taken to the mainland where she was . able to ring her mother. 'I'm still in shock. I have seen the corpses of my friends and several of my friends are missing. 'I am glad I am alive. This summer's most beautiful fairy tale is transformed into Norway's worst nightmare.' Adrian Pracon, one of the organisers . of the political summer camp, was working in the information booth when . the massacre took place. The . 21-year-old, who was shot in the back as he pretended to play dead, . said people had thought the gunman, dressed in police uniform, was there . to help. He also described how he would shoot . to kill, carefully pulling the trigger, and said the blond-haired . gunman looked as though he was straight out of a 'Nazi movie'. 'The . man started walking towards the camp and people ran up to him to ask . him what was going on. They head heard what had happened further down . the hill, but the man he brought out a gun and he shot four people,' said Mr Pracon. 'They came to him for help and he just shot them. It's unbelievable that something like this could happen.' Survivor Thorbjorn Verride, 22, from the shootings on Utoya island breaks down after being taken to safety . A group of young girls comfort one another after Breivik went on his killing spree . Survivor: Adrian Pracon, his shot gun wound clearly visible, speaks to the BBC about the terror that unfolded on the island . Camp: Temporary morgue tents were put up by rescue workers after 85 people were killed on the island of Utoya . Mr Pracon described how the 32-year-old right wing extremist knew his victims had little chance of escape and would check bodies for any signs of life, kicking them as he moved along. 'He then started looking for people and followed them into their tents, he kept shooting them inside their tents and they had nowhere to hide. Rescue workers search for bodies in the lake. It is believed a mini submarine is also being used in the search . 'There were 20 to 30 people died in the water, I saw a couple of people being shot and the weapon was so powerful. The jet of the water was huge and became red,' he said. Desperate to escape he hid behind the dead bodies and lay there before he heard Breivik coming. 'Luckily I was lying down but people were falling about me. Around my legs, behind me and in the front of me so I hid behind them. I stayed completely still and did not want to show the gunman any sign of life. 'He walked towards me, over dead bodies that were lying around me, I heard his shoes walking and felt his breath. 'He was calm and collective, he was not in a hurry to press the trigger quickly and if people ran, he knew he would catch them, no problem,' Mr Pracon told the BBC. Before he was shot Mr Pracon said he had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only managed a short distance before deciding to turn back. He was then shot in the shoulder as he tried to pretend he was dead. Now, recovering in hospital, he said: 'I heard a loud band and a high pitched sound in my ear and after that it lasted until I went to the hospital.' A small submarine, pictured, is being lowered into the water to help in the search for victims .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- It's been three years to the month since Dan Brown's book \"The Da Vinci Code\" hit theater screens, becoming a worldwide blockbuster. Tom Hanks says working in Rome, Italy, added to the production values of \"Angels & Demons.\" Now superstar Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard are back with another of Brown's best-sellers, \"Angels & Demons.\" Unlike the previous effort in which the Oscar-winning duo went on a shooting spree across several European countries, the new film takes place in just one locale, Rome. Much of the movie was shot on soundstages and sets built in Hollywood, but the cast and crew also spent months in the Italian capital, which they say provided the film with an undeniable authenticity, not easily duplicated anywhere else.  Watch the excitement of shooting in Rome \u00bb . Hanks and Howard sat down with CNN to talk about the challenges -- and \"blessings,\" in Hanks' word -- of making \"Angels & Demons\" happen in one of the world's most densely trafficked, architecturally powerful cities. Tom Hanks: You're shooting in a place like Rome and quite frankly, every layer of history and every passer-by, every scooter, every truck adds to the ambience of the film, the production value that you couldn't get in a million years if we were trying to fake it during the daylight hours back home. Ron Howard: We used every device known to cinema, from the latest cutting-edge technology to certain filmic illusions that go back a hundred years, literally to the birth of the medium, to sort of low-budget street photography where you['re] just pull[ing] up in a car, getting out a van, clearing a little space and shooting a shot. And I hope that it does the thing that these kind of adventures should do, which is really transport an audience. Hanks: Every step of the way we seem to be enjoying the blessings of how complicated it is to shoot in a place of Rome. We had a lady show up who was getting married at the Pantheon, and she had to get to the altar, and we had to get our shots. She showed up right between shots when we were moving the cameras. We got her into her wedding day. We went and got our shots; she came out when she was done -- huzzahs all the way around and before the sun went down we were still able to finish up our day.",

        "article": "HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- Fidel Castro, the longtime Communist leader of Cuba, met with visiting members of the U.S. Congressional Black Caucus on Tuesday, a day after his brother, Raul, who succeeded him as president, did the same, according to a U.S. official in Havana. U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, at left with Reps. Marcia Fudge and Mel Watt, was among those who met with Castro. The meeting with Fidel Castro, 82, comes amid speculation that the United States is considering a shift in relations with the Communist nation that sits just 90 miles from the Florida Keys. Upon returning to the United States, members of the caucus said it's time to consider an end to the trade embargo and other diplomatic restrictions placed on Cuba for the past five decades. \"Yes, we have history. We have good history and not-so-good history,\" said Rep. Laura Richardson, D-California. \"But the point is, it's history, and we need to move forward.\" Three members of the caucus were visiting the Latin American School of Medicine, where students from nations including the United States study, when they were invited to meet with the senior leader. \"Former President Fidel Castro is very engaging, very energetic,\" said caucus Chairwoman Barbara Lee, also a Democrat from California. \"Our conclusion is, given the new direction in our foreign policy, that it's time to look at a new direction in our policy toward Cuba. \"The 50-year embargo just hasn't worked,\" she said. There was no immediate response from the Obama administration on the meeting. But asked earlier about Monday's meeting with Ra\u00fal Castro, State Department spokesman Robert Wood declined to say what, if any, role it could play in a possible warming of a decades-long diplomatic and economic freeze. \"Members of Congress have the right to travel where they want and to discuss issues with whom they want,\" Wood said. \"And I am sure members of that delegation will be raising some of the concerns that the U.S. government has with Cuba, in terms of allowing Cubans to have some of the same rights and freedoms as other countries in the hemisphere.\" Obama has said he is in favor of changing the relationship with Cuba but has not offered specifics. Government officials have hinted that he may soon lift travel restrictions between the two countries. In a letter published Tuesday in the online version of Granma, a state-run Cuban newspaper, Fidel Castro wrote that an unnamed caucus member told him \"he was sure that Obama would change Cuba policy but that Cuba should also help him.\" He noted that the group was in Cuba during the anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s April 4 assassination and visited a center dedicated to King. \"I value the gesture of this legislative group,\" Fidel Castro wrote. \"The aura of Luther King is accompanying them. Our press has given broad coverage of their visit. They are exceptional witnesses to the respect that U.S. citizens visiting our homeland always receive.\" The United States broke diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1961, two years after Fidel Castro took office. The following year, the U.S. government instituted a trade embargo. Both policies still remain in effect. Early last year, and with his health failing, Fidel Castro announced that he was resigning from the presidency. The Cuban National Assembly appointed Ra\u00fal Castro to the post days later. Fidel Castro led the revolution that, in 1959, overthrew Cuba's Batista dictatorship. He was credited with bringing social reforms to Cuba but criticized internationally for oppressing human rights and free speech. Despite widely documented health problems the past few years, including intestinal surgery in 2006 that required him to turn power over to Ra\u00fal while he recovered, Fidel Castro seemed to be largely in good health, the delegation said. \"Of course, he has been ill, but I think we will agree he was very healthy, very energetic and very clear thinking,\" Lee said. \"He was very engaging.\" Two caucus members, Reps. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri and Bobby Rush of Illinois, preached sermons at two Cuban churches to commemorate the anniversary of King's assassination. While in Cuba, the delegation also met with family members of the so-called Cuban Five, a group imprisoned in the United States after being convicted of spying. In 2005, a three-judge appeals court panel overturned the convictions, but the full court later reversed that decision.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Stargazers in North America were delighted this week to see a highly anticipated comet make an appearance in the March sky. The comet is called Pan-STARRS, and it gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001: the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii. Brian Karczewski, 24, got a great shot of the comet from a California church parking lot and submitted an iReport about it. \"I love astronomy and find astrophotography a good challenge,\" he said. \"I was very excited to capture the comet next to the moon. Never photographed a comet before!\" Adam Block, program coordinator at the Mount Lemmon Sky Center at the University of Arizona, snapped his first Pan-STARRS picture March 10. He used a DSLR camera and a 300mm fixed lens. \"I took that image from my house in Tucson, and I was hoping to show that anyone, even from the city, can potentially see the comet!\" he said in an e-mail. Quasar -- galactic beauty, deadly beast -- discovered 50 years ago . Block also took some sharp images Tuesday against the background of a colorful twilight. \"A bright comet in the sky is great for me since the universe is giving me a new and captivating way to inspire people as part of the experiences I offer at the observatory,\" he said. Send us your questions about time-lapse videos . If you missed Pan-STARRS, there may be another comet-viewing opportunity later this year. Comet ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012. It's named after their night-sky survey program, the International Scientific Optical Network. On November 28, ISON is expected to dive into the sun's atmosphere. If it survives, it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight. Its tail might stretch far across the night sky. More space and science news from CNN Light Years. CNN's Amanda Barnett contributed to this report.",

Emojili, set to launch later this year, will only allow its users to send emoji to each other. Even usernames on the system will be emoji - and over 10,000 people have already signed up. Scroll down for video . The network is already asking people to reserve their username - made up of emoji . A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, . is emoji \u2013 the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion . in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like . wildfire online. The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media. Other terms to make the list include 'futebol\u2019, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the . missing Malaysia Airlines plane. 'We've just passed 10,000 usernames reserved, the firm said on its Twitter feed. 'Fortunately there are more than 250,000 possible two-emoji combos, so most are still available!' The site was set up by Londoners Matt Gray and Tom Scott, who say they were inspired by Yo, which allows users to simply send the word Yo. 'The two of us had the idea at about the same time \u2014 we weren\u2019t sold on it until we realized that usernames should be emoji too,' Gray told Forbes. 'At that point, we burst out laughing and realized we had to build it.' However, the pair have so far refused to say exactly how the app will work. Emoji (selection pictured) were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online, however, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'(e) + 'letter' (moji) Earlier this year it was revealed Apple is working to expand the diversity of the hugely popular emoji characters for the iPhone. Following complaints that the current character set was not diverse enough, the firm said it was working with the standards body that controls them. Because Emoji have to be displayed on different devices, they are tightly controlled by the Unicode Consortium. At present the list of characters contains dozens of faces of people that appear to be white. However, only two of the symbols seem to be Asian and none are black. Since 2010 a basic list has been developed and maintained by the Unicode Consortium - a Silicon Valley-based non-profit organisation made up of major computer firms, software producers, user groups and others. Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere. Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture' (e) + 'letter' (moji). Icons . are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as . a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white . flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji . representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese . curry, and sushi. Some . emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them . to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added. Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month. It does this to ensure that different devices and mobile carriers can share a basic set. The latest disclosure came after Apple boss Tim Cook was emailed asking if the firm was going to address the issue. The diversity of emoji was also questioned in a petition posted to DoSomething.org calling on Apple to increase the ethnic diversity found within its emoji keyboard. 'Of the more than 800 Emojis, the only two resembling people of color are a guy who looks vaguely Asian and another in a turban,' it says. 'There's a white boy, girl, man, woman, elderly man, elderly woman, blonde boy, blonde girl and, we're pretty sure, [video game character] Princess Peach.' A petition suggested that emoji like these could be added to Apple's keyboard . 'But when it comes to faces outside of yellow smileys, there's a staggering lack of minority representation.' It added that the keyboard already offered a graphic showing a same-sex couple, and called on the company to present people with a wider range of skin tones.",

        "article": "By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 06:05 EST, 6 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:57 EST, 6 July 2013 . An ambulance was sent 83 miles to help a critically-ill pensioner - even though he lived barely a mile from a hospital. Barry Edwards, 79, from Cambridge, had dialled 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. He had suffered an aortic aneurysm - a dangerous condition which occurs when a blood vessel in the stomach swells. But the call was not treated as urgent and it took two more 999 calls and visits from a doctor and a paramedic before an ambulance finally arrived almost two and a half hours later, the Cambridge News reported. Critical: Mr Edwards waited for more than two hours for an ambulance despite complaining of severe stomach pains . It had been dispatched from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, a distance of almost 83 miles and at least an hour and a half drive, despite the fact that Mr Edwards lived only a few streets away from Addenbrooke's Hospital where he was eventually treated. He died the following morning. East of England Ambulance Trust (EEAT) said an investigation is underway to establish what happened. The Trust has come in for major criticism recently after a damaging report about its performance. The service, which covers Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, was criticised for almost two years over its poor response times, particularly in rural areas, before it was reviewed. The long way round: An ambulance was eventually sent on an 83 mile journey from Great Yarmouth to Mr Edwards' house on Ashbury Close in Cambridge . MP Anthony Marsh, who carried out the review, said managers had developed a 'sense of helplessness' which had led to the failings. All five non-executive directors of the Trust have since resigned in the wake of the scandal. Mr Edwards' sister Madelaine described the agonising last few hours before the ambulance finally arrived on December 5 last year. She told the Cambridge News:\u00a0 'I knew my brother was going to die. The last few hours of his life were horrific. He deserved so much better than that.' Mrs Edwards has called for 999 operators to be better trained so that emergency calls are properly assessed. Her local MP Julian Huppert has written to the Trust asking for a full investigation into the case. Investigation: MP Julian Huppert described Mr Edwards' treatment as 'appalling' and said lessons must be learned . The Trust told him that a review had been carried out, but as Mrs Edwards was not happy with the conclusions, a fresh investigation is underway. Mr Huppert described the treatment of Mr Edwards as 'appalling'. He said a full review is necessary so that lessons are learned. A spokesman for the EEAT told Cambridge News: 'The MP Julian Huppert made an official complaint in December and the concerns were investigated and EEAST sent their findings to Julian Huppert. 'Following this, he wasn\u2019t happy with the outcome so the investigation has been reopened by EEAST and this is an on-going process. 'Once the follow up investigation is resolved, Julian will receive the updates as a matter of priority.'",

        "article": "(Lonely Planet) -- From the steep slopes of volcanic Haleakala to the wealth of surf spots, Maui beckons lovers of sun, sand and surf. But venture just beyond the hotel buffet and discover what a foodie destination the Valley Island has become. Maui's culinary landscape is heavily influenced by fresh, local and 'ono (delicious) flavors. Chefs, farmers, ranchers and fishermen work together toward a sustainable future where island ingredients are the featured attraction on daily menus and reflect the agriculture and people of Maui. The Hawaiian Regional Cuisine movement started in 1991, with 12 founding chefs interested in focusing on using the freshest local ingredients to achieve the diverse flavors of island dishes. Three of those original chefs head restaurants in Maui: Mark Ellman of Mala Ocean Tavern, Beverly Gannon of Hali'imaile General Store and Peter Merriman of Merriman's Kapalua. Those and some of the founding chefs' more recent ventures -- including Ellman's newest, Honu, in Lahaina, Gannon's eponymous Gannon's and Merriman's Monkeypod Kitchen in Wailea -- are among the best places to get a sample of Maui flavor, straight from the farm to the table. Lonley Planet: Hawaii for first-timers: how to choose an island . Just like the wealth and diversity of fresh local ingredients, their availability spans beyond large restaurants to smaller establishments. Get a taste of guri-guri, a treat crossed between ice cream and sherbet, at Tasaka Guri Guri. Another sweet option is the island-style ice cream at Roselani Tropics Ice Cream, featuring local flavors such as vanilla, mango, pineapple and coffee. Home Maid Bakery's crispy manju has luscious fillings from azuki beans to coconut. Take some island style home in a bag of Maui coffee. The best place to do your shopping is on a coffee estate, where you can get a look at where your morning beverage comes from, such as MauiGrown Coffee or Kupa'a Farms. Farmers' markets and farm stands have become more than a regular shopping opportunity for locals -- they're now a common stop on a visitor's itinerary as well. Markets are an easy way to showcase Maui's farms and ranches and the food they produce. Even big-name hotels are helping lead the way in supporting local farmers by including their products in sustainable and organic menus.\u00c2\u00a0The stand at Kula Country Farms, as well as farmers' markets in Makawao, Kahului and other locations throughout Maui are ideal opportunities to see the variety of locally raised products and produce on the island -- and buy some to taste. Lonely Planet: Top 20 Hawaiian vistas . A visit to one of Maui's farms can be both fun and educational, especially when it's in Kula. In Upcountry Maui on the slopes of Mount Haleakala, the Kula area takes advantage of its rich volcanic soil and cool climate, and has been central to the island's culinary resurgence. Much of the produce you'll find on the tables of Maui's best restaurants focusing on Hawaiian Regional Cuisine is grown in and around Kula, including the sweet Maui onion. Start with a gourmet lunch tour and real farm-to-table experience at O'o Farm, an 8.5-acre natural farm operated by the Pacific'O and I'O restaurants. Milk a goat at the Surfing Goat Dairy, then see the cheese-making process before you sample some for yourself. Get an exotic walking tour through the sweet-smelling fields of Ali`i Kula Lavender, or wander the grounds of Maui's Winery at Ulupalakua Ranch -- before you wander right into the tasting room. Sustainable food on Maui isn't just about produce -- it also includes island-grazed beef and grass-fed lamb. Island ranching dates back to the 19th century, and is a large part of the local paniolo culture. The Maui Cattle Company produces meats from six ranch partners throughout the island, from Hana to the slopes of Haleakala. While every day is a celebration with island cuisine options, Maui food festivals offer an opportunity to get immersed in a particular food item, like the Maui Onion Festival or the East Maui Taro Festival.

        "article": "(CNN) -- The man who allegedly lit an explosive on board a U.S.-bound international flight deserves none of the constitutional protections afforded American citizens, a former top Bush administration official said Monday. Tom Ridge, who served as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005, made the comments on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"I take a look at this individual who has been charged criminally, does that mean he gets his Miranda warnings? The only information we get is if he volunteers it?\" Ridge said. \"He's not a citizen of this country. He's a terrorist, and I don't think he deserves the full range of protections of our criminal justice system embodied in the Constitution of the United States.\" Ridge also said he was \"not surprised\" about reports that two former detainees in the detention center at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had joined up with the group that claimed responsibility for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab's failed terrorist attack. \"It's a symptom of a larger challenge that this country has, and that's how do you adjudicate these individuals that we pick up from these places and make a determination if they should be incarcerated for a long time, if not permanently,\" he said. Muhamad Attik al-Harbi, also known as Muhamad al-Awfi, and Said Ali Shari were released to Saudi Arabia in 2007 by the Bush administration. The two went through a \"rehabilitation\" program in Saudi Arabia but returned to the militants. U.S. officials, however, cautioned that the two could not be connected with Friday's attack. Ridge told King that the country is \"clearly ... safer, but it's equally clear, given the several incidents that have occurred in the last couple of months in this country, that we still have very serious gaps in information-sharing.\" \"What are we going to do to make sure more information, particularly with that kind of information that sends warning signals out, gets to the people that can act on it?\" he said. \"Whether you're in the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan or a screener at the airport, you need actionable information. I'm not sure all this information was in the hands of TSA at the time.\" Ridge also questioned why the State Department did not revoke AbdulMutallab's visa upon learning that his father had reported his son might have terrorist connections. \"Why the State Department didn't revoke his visa immediately is beyond belief, in my judgment,\" he said. \"But at the heart of this, it's a clash of cultures and institutional challenge. [The Department of Homeland Security] can only act on information it has, and they didn't have all the information at its disposal.\" The former secretary was less critical of current Secretary Janet Napolitano than many other Republicans for comments she made praising the way some protocols had worked. \"I don't think any right-thinking person actually believed that Secretary Napolitano thought the system worked,\" he said. \"Obviously, it was flawed. I think what she was referring to was that after the incident occurred, there are certain procedures and protocols to put in place. That worked smoothly.\"",

        "article": "Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle website Goop is handing out quasi-scientific health advice again, this time to pregnant women. According to Ms Paltrow's osteopath - self-described pain expert Vicky Vlachonis, who penned 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' for Goop - expectant mothers should be careful not to 'relax their vigilance over food', and to always 'remind' themselves: 'You don\u2019t need a ton of food to sustain your baby.' Ms Vlachonis' specific advice about what not to eat while pregnant - 'dairy, rich fatty meats, pork, peanut butter, wheat and sugar, for example' - is very much in keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, so should come as no surprise to dedicated readers of the health-focused website. Scroll down for video . Pseudo-science? Gwyneth Paltrow's (left) osteopath\u00a0Vicky Vlachonis (right) has written a 'ten ways to have a pain-free pregnancy' guide for Goop, in which she encourages a laundry list of food restrictions . Ms Paltrow, who has two children, Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin, has written of Ms Vlachonis in the past: 'As an osteopath, Vicky understands that a pain in the back is rarely just a pain in the back.' But while a number of the tips offered up in the piece \u2013 such as keeping calm and maintaining a healthy diet \u2013 have been welcomed by health experts, Dr. Pat Salber, an internist and the author of popular advice site, TheDoctorWeighsIn.com, tells Daily Mail Online that there is little scientific fact to back up some of Goop\u2019s advice. 'Although not as \"sexy\" as \"anti-inflammatory diets\" and \"magical cures\", common sense approaches to diet and exercise will help you have healthy pregnancy,' she says of the website\u2019s top tips. And when it came to Ms Vlachonic\u2019s suggestion that pregnant women should see grapefruit as a \u2018magical cure\u2019 for morning sickness \u2013 while other foods like wheat, dairy meat and sugar should be avoided at all costs because they increase systemic inflammation \u2013 Dr Salber explained that there is very little evidence to back up any of these claims. 'I am unaware of any science behind this grapefruit recommendation, let alone any evidence to support it,' Dr Salber remarks. 'Most women find that small frequent meals of bland carbohydrates, crackers for example, help with the nausea.' Glowing: In keeping with Ms Paltrow's strict diet, Ms Vlachonic advises expectant moms avoid 'dairy, rich fatty meats, peanut butter, wheat and sugar'. Pictured, Ms Paltrow pregnant with her daughter Apple in 2004 . Ms Vlachonic also makes several references to the impact of the 'pressure' caused by the growing baby on a mother-to-be's back, and warns against lower back massages. 'Pregnant women shouldn't worry about stress on their spine and pelvis because of pregnancy,' counters Dr Salber. 'Remember women's pelvis' evolved to a different shape than men's because we become pregnant.' As for diet, Dr Salber recommends a variety of 'fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, and a protein source - whether meat or non-meat'. She does concur with Ms Vlachonis on her advice that pregnant women should 'watch their portion size' however, and recommends 'avoiding fast foods, overly processed foods, and sugared sodas'. One of us: While critics have dubbed her out of touch in recent years, Ms Paltrow, pictured last week in Hong Kong, recently insisted she was 'incredibly close to the common woman' In regards to recommended weight gain, Dr Salber admits: 'There is a great deal of consensus in the medical community about how much weight women should gain during pregnancy. 'It depends on whether you are normal, over, or underweight to start with.' 'Normal weight women should gain between 25-35 pounds, underweight women between 28 to 40 pounds, and overweight between 15-25 pounds. Obese women should gain slightly less, between 11-20 pounds. Other kernels of advice offered up by Ms Vlachonic in her recent Goop post include getting 12 to 14 hours of sleep a day, and plenty of time spent in the 'bathtub, a pool, or the sea.' She even helpfully suggests: 'The crowd that hangs out at the pool tend to be so kind and sweet when you\u2019re pregnant!' Repeat offender: Goop (pictured) often comes under fire for handing out questionable health advice, not to mention outrageously expensive products . This is far from the first time Goop has been criticized for its questionable health advice. In January, Ms Paltrow came under fire for suggesting women partake in 'vaginal steams', which she said 'cleanse your uterus' and 'balance female hormone levels'. This information was slammed by doctors, some who even suggested the practice might be harmful. Just this week, Ms Paltrow defended herself in the face of long-standing criticism surrounding Goop's expensive and unattainable content. Speaking to CNN Money, she said: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers. 'We all want fulfillment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'",

        "article": "The challenge double-amputee Kayden Elijah faces is heartbreakingly obvious - but he doesn't seem to know it. With his hands clasped to a walker, the two-year-old inches down the corridor, swaying and falling into the hands of a carer hovering nearby. But Elijah never loses faith, repeatedly saying 'I got it'. Scroll down for video . Elijah takes a confident first step . Then loses his balance and falls . Steadying himself he tries again . Elijah steps out on his own . Inching away from his carer . He smiles up at onlookers . After each fall, he steadies himself again and pushes forward. 'One, two,' the carer says and Elijah echoes it back. She then tells him to keep his legs wider, but he just keeps defiantly repeating, 'I got it'. The video was originally posted to You Tube and Facebook by Elijah's mother, Nikki Kinko, of New Jersey, but has now been shared around the world. Ms Kinko is trying to raise money to pay for more therapy and equipment for her son through fundraising website gofundme. About \u00a31300 has so far been raised. On the page, Ms Kinko explains that Elijah was born with Omhalocele, a condition that meant his organs remained on the outside of his body. Elijah, in a picture from his gofundme page, learns to stand in his prosthetic limbs which were fitted in January . Elijah's freshly bandaged stumps can be seen as he sits after having his right foot and left leg amputated . Elijah, who was born with his organs outside his body, looks happy in a picture taken before his operation . He also had a band wrap around his legs and feet which led to some deformity. Elijah had two surgeries for the condition, and in January had his right foot and left leg amputated. Ms Kinko writes on the page: 'We are raising money for extra physical therapy visits, braces and prosthetics for Kayden and to pay off outstanding medical bills.' Elijah, in a picture taken off his fundraising page, and his family need help to raise money for extra physical therapy, braces and prosthetics . 'We are also trying to publish a book about his life and prayerfully have him attend a camp for children with prosthetics in Atlanta when he is old enough.' She also revealed that doctors had advised her during her pregnancy that Elijah 'wouldn't make it'.",

A drug dealer has been jailed after police found his fingerprints on a Nando's napkin he had used to wrap cocaine. Ajaz Raja, 32, pleaded guilty\u00a0to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and was jailed for two years and four months. Detectives found almost \u00a37,000 of cocaine in a house in the Cheetham Hill area of Manchester - and Raja's fingerprints were discovered on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap some of the Class A drug. Manchester Crown Court heard\u00a0that on 19 November last year, officers from North Manchester's Organised Crime Unit conducted a drugs warrant at a house on Lytton Avenue, Cheetham Hill. They found cocaine with a street value of \u00a36,960, dozens of unused snap bags, and a set of digital scales. Raja's fingerprints were later found on a Nando's napkin he'd used to partially wrap a bag of cocaine in. PC Darren Wayman, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'No matter how well drug dealers think they cover their tracks they will always slip up, as in this case. 'Once we presented the prints evidence to him he has little option but to admit to the offence. 'He's now been jailed for more than two years so he won't be enjoying a meal out at Nando's, or anywhere else for that matter, for some time.' Raja's fingerprints were found a Nando's napkin that had been used to partially wrap cocaine (file picture)",

        "article": "New York (CNN) -- A famously macabre painting by Andy Warhol sold for $105.4 million Wednesday, a record for the famed pop artist and the second-most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to Sotheby's auction house. \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" shows a twisted body in the wreckage of a car crash, part of Warhol's vaunted \"Death and Disaster\" series, painted in 1963. Arts magazine ARTNews published an interview with Warhol in November 1963, in which the artist said of the series, \"I guess it was the big plane crash picture, the front page of a newspaper: 129 DIE. I was also painting the Marilyns. I realized that everything I was doing must have been Death.\" The large painting, which measures 8 feet by 13 feet, is one of only four works of that size in the series and the only one remaining in a private collection, according to Sotheby's. It had been in a private collection since 1989 and has rarely been viewed in public. Sotheby's declined to identify the buyer. \"'Silver Car Crash' is the most important work of contemporary art we have ever had the privilege to offer, and its exceptional result is a testament to that fact,\" said Tobias Meyer, worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby's and the evening's auctioneer. Another well-known painting from the 1960s also sold for over $100 million this week. On Tuesday, Francis Bacon's \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\" sold for $142.4 million after six minutes of bidding in the room and on the phone at Christie's in New York, the most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to auction house spokeswoman Elizabeth Van Bergen. Another iconic Warhol image, \"Coca-Cola (3),\" sold for $57.2 million Tuesday at Christie's. \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" was one of several Warhol pieces in the Sotheby's auction Wednesday. \"Liz #1 (Early Colored Liz)\" drew $20.3 million and \"Flowers (Five Foot Flowers)\" sold for $11.3 million, according to the auction house. Andy Warhol pops up in China... again . CNN's Sho Wills and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

        "article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- People walked by 12-year-old Yance Phillips as he danced on Hollywood Boulevard on Sunday. YaYa, 2, stands near framed coverage of Michael Jackson's death on the Walk of Fame on Sunday. He swayed and bounced to the beat of a boom box, drawing only a glance from people making their way down the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Then he moonwalked, and suddenly, Phillips had the crowd's attention. \"I watched Michael Jackson, and I just tried to do it like he does,\" Yance said. \"I like the moves that he does.\" As thousands gathered in Los Angeles to say goodbye to a star who had been entertaining since he was a little boy, it was hard not to notice the children in the crowd. Toddlers in the arms of their parents who were fans, and kids wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Jackson's face gathered at the Staples Center and beyond as the city geared up for the pop icon's memorial service. A group of tweens even pooled their money to trek from the Valley to Hollywood -- sans adults and sharing a digital camera -- to take pictures of Jackson's star on the Walk of Fame for a video they wanted to create.  See what fans had to say at the Walk of Fame \u00bb . They were too young to know about the singer's legal troubles or to remember a time when Jackson's appearance was quite different from what it was in his final years. To them, he was just a star who could sing and dance across a floor like magic. \"I like all of his music and how he dresses,\" said 8-year-old Sarah McClure as she glanced down at her own Michael Jackson T-shirt. \"My favorite is 'Thriller.' \" McClure traveled more than 90 miles with her little sister, Emily, 5, and her mother, Geri McClure, to visit the Staples Center, where the memorial to Jackson will be held Tuesday. As they waited in line to sign a wall of remembrance to the singer, Geri McClure said she wanted her daughters \"to be a part of history.\" \"Plus, they love his music,\" she added. \"He was an entertainer for the different generations.\" Barbara Alvarez and her husband, David, endured the heat as well as they waited with their children Isaac, 8, William, 4, and 1-year-old Ava. \"Watching and listening to Michael Jackson was one of the happiest memories of my childhood,\" Alvarez said. \"I grew up on his music.\" She wanted to impart that to her kids. Isaac smiled shyly as his mother revealed that he became a fan years ago after she showed him the \"Thriller\" video. \"My daughter even dances to his music,\" said Alvarez, as Ava rested in the shade of her stroller. Yance Phillips said he was doing his moonwalk on Hollywood Boulevard to raise money to help bury a relative. Donations poured into the jar at his feet. His grandmother, Regina Stevenson, said Jackson's appeal was-wide ranging and touched fans of all ages and nationalities. \"He showed children of all races that they could be successful,\" Stevenson said. Maria Pace, who is almost 20 years old, said she can remember how Jackson helped ease the path of her younger years. She was a shy girl from Spain, unsure of how to make friends in her new homeland of Bakersfield, California, when a fellow classmate  played some Michael Jackson music and the pair bonded. \"She liked Michael Jackson music, and I liked Michael Jackson music, and we started dancing to it,\" Pace recalled. \"It was me, her and another girl, and we became known as the Jackson girls.\" Pace said she doesn't believe there will ever be another entertainer like Jackson, but she hopes younger generations continue to be inspired by him -- especially a trio of children who know firsthand of his talent. \"Maybe one day,\" Pace said, \"one of his children will become a performer.\"",

        "article": "By . Alexandra Klausner . An overachiever who drove a sports car and was on track 'to become CEO of a company one day' was discovered dead an outhouse on April 19 where he was apparently seeking refuge from the cold. Gary Szarek of Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan quit his job working with computers at West Point University about 30 years ago when he didn't get a promotion and afterwards family says he became a recluse. Following his death by hypothermia inside a white portable toilet at the 9 Mile boat ramp in St. Clair Shores, family members learned that their estranged 65-year-old relative had been homeless and surviving any way he could. Gary Szarek, an overachiever turned reclusive homeless man was discovered dead inside a potable toilet where he died of hypothermia up to 4 months ago . A portable toilet in St. Clair Shores Where Gary Szarek, former Grosse Pointe Woods resident turned homeless man, was found dead by hypothermia . Police believe that Szarek could have died as early as December 8. Szarek's family home is Grosse Point Woods went through tax foreclosure in 2010 and Szarek had been living on the streets ever since. 'It was a sad situation,' said Szarek\u2019s cousin, Debra Hunkins of Mayville, to The Detroit Free Press. 'He was a ... person who contributed to society. ... He was almost, like, ahead of his time, very personable, liked to dance. Then it was just totally different.' As soon as the story about Szarek circulated the media, family members, friends, and genealogists contacted investigators to gain whatever information they could. 'How nice of people to do that. It kind of restores your faith in people,' St. Clair Shores Police Detective Margaret Eidt said. An . investigation found that the Grosse Point Library had contact with . Szarek in October when he was forced to leave because he was eating in . the library and bathing in the bathroom. Szarek . would stay in the library and would also make money to survive by returning bottles to Kroger stores at Marter and . Jefferson and 9 Mile and Mack both in the St. Clair Shores. Eidt said that sometimes Szarek would get a donation of war, food and clothing from people who knew him. Eidt . told the Detroit Free Press that a resident at the Shore Club . apartments near the boat ramp that he often had a backpack which police . did not find. Szarek was found with $146 in his wallet, he had $20 in bottle returns and also had seven Mega Millions lottery tickets. The toilet was filled with trash and receipts dating back to December 8 when police think Szarek may Have died. Szarek was discovered in a portable toilet near the 9 mile boat ramp in St. Clair Shores pictured here . Szarek was discovered wearing a plaid green shirt, a hooded sweatshirt, a black windbreaker,a gray T-shirt, a pair of socks, boots, a hat, and mittens. Szarek slept in a black garbage bag. Szarek's cousin Debra Hunkins said that Szarek was never married and never had any children. 'For whatever reason, he was bypassed (for the promotion),' said Hunkins, who contacted police after hearing about her cousin\u2019s death. 'When it happened, it caused some type of breakdown.' Hunkin said her cousin was on track to become a\u00a0 CEO of a company someday. She described him as 'intelligent.' After Szarek lost his house family members say they had no way of getting in touch with him. Szarek sent his aunt a Christmas card every year but after his aunt died five years ago, they 'had no way of knowing where he was or is he was alive.' Hunkins said that Szarek 'became a stranger to most of the family.' Szarek's brother in law Wayne Dulong said Szarek cared for his mother after his father died but once his mother died he split from his sister and Dulong never saw him again. Dulong sad that he believed Szarek had a mental illness and said that letters sent to Szarek's residence were all returned. 'It makes you sad,' Hunkins said. 'How do you connect with people like that when he couldn\u2019t connect with his own (family). \u2026 We don\u2019t know what he was thinking. We don\u2019t understand.'The portable toilet where Szarek's decomposing body was discovered has been removed from the boat launch, cleaned, and secured with tape.",

This CCTV footage shows the terrifying moment three masked men, armed with a machete and a hammer, robbed a branch of Subway. After threatening a female employee, the trio made off with around \u00a3300 from the sandwich shop shortly before closing time. One of the men, wearing a Scream-style mask, stayed on the door of the shop, in Clayton, Manchester, while the other two men, who were armed, ran inside. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: A Subway worker was threatened with a machete as the store was raided by three masked men . While the hammer-wielding thief jumped over the counter, the man with the machete ran into the staff area. The pair then surrounded a 25-year-old worker and demanded she give them cash or they would hurt her. One of the men lifted the machete above his head in a threatening manner. The gang stole from the cash register before running out of the shop. There were no customers inside at the time of the incident and the woman was not injured. The man carrying the wooden-handled machete was medium build and around 5ft 7in to 5ft 8in. He was wearing a black balaclava, had dark eyes and spoke with a local accent. He was wearing a navy tracksuit with blue Nike tracksuit bottoms and trainers and wore black woollen gloves. Raid: Three men burst into the Subway store in Clayton, Manchester, on the evening of November 5 . As the man with the hammer jumps behind the shop's counter, the other goes through into the staff area . Shock: The Subway worker watches on in horror as the men, who threatened her, empty the till . The man carrying the hammer was scrawny, around 5ft 6in and believed to be 18 to 22-years-old. He was wearing a black balaclava and was possibly white with brown eyes. He wore a navy blue tracksuit top, navy blue tracksuit bottoms and black woollen gloves. The man by the door is described as wearing a Scream-style mask, dark clothing with the hood pulled up and was around 6ft and skinny. The hammer-wielding thief empties the till of notes and then coins before the trio prepare to exit the shop . The man on the door, who was wearing a Scream-style mask, props the door open for the escape . The thieves, who police have not yet identified, flee after emptying the till, making away with around \u00a3300 . The incident happened on Tuesday, November 5. Det Con Dave Berry said: 'Unless anyone has been in a similar situation themselves, I don't think we can appreciate just how scared this woman must have been to have a machete threatened at her in this way by a man in a mask - and all just for a few notes from a till.' Anyone with information is asked to call police at Central Park on 0161 856 4288 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.",

        "article": "Bad taste: Crass game Cards Against Humanity . Billed as \u2018a party game for horrible people\u2019, it is the latest craze being played at dinner parties across the land. Cards Against Humanity is a game in which players are encouraged to be as \u2018despicable\u2019 and offensive as they possibly can. Critics have slammed the US creators who admit their aim was to tarnish Britain\u2019s most sacred institutions. The card game mocks the Royal Family, politicians and the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool football fans died. It also insults dead reality TV star Jade Goody and missing youngster Madeleine McCann. The McCanns\u2019 spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said: \u2018The offensiveness of this speaks for itself. For the makers of the game to make light of a missing child is beyond offensive. They should reconsider what they\u2019re doing and all Madeleine references should be cut out of future editions. It is deeply offensive.\u2019 In the game, one player asks a question from a black card and everyone else answers with their \u2018funniest\u2019 white card. It is the nature of the questions and answers on the cards, that make the game so controversial. Each black card is either a question, or a phrase where the key words have been left as blank. At first they might seem innocuous, such as: \u2018What\u2019s that smell?\u2019 However, another card reads: \u2018In Michael Jackson\u2019s final moments he thought about...\u2019 The players then respond from the selection of answers from white cards they have in their hand. These include \u2018Madeleine McCann\u2019, \u2018Jade Goody\u2019s cancerous remains\u2019 and \u2018Hillsborough\u2019. One card reads \u2018Queen Elizabeth\u2019s immaculate a***\u2019 and another says: \u2018Leaked footage of Kate Middleton\u2019s colonoscopy.\u2019 Other cards include \u2018Auschwitz\u2019, \u2018Kids with bum cancer\u2019 and \u2018Chunks of dead prostitute\u2019. The person who creates the \u2018funniest\u2019 or most offensive answer wins a point. Missing Madeleine McCann is mocked in the dinner party card game . Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: \u2018It\u2019s in extreme bad taste. It\u2019s not satire, it\u2019s very unfunny whether you\u2019re a monarchist or not.\u2019 Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton and Hillsborough campaigner, said: \u2018It is hard to understand the mentality of those who have produced such a disgusting and offensive game. I hope people refrain from becoming involved in such a despicable activity.\u2019 However, the creators remain unapologetic. Eli Halpern, 27, project leader of the British version, said: \u2018One card is \u201cQueen Elizabeth\u2019s immaculate a***\u201d. That was our mission statement, to take the most sacred thing in the UK and tarnish it. Reality television show star Jade Goody, who died from cancer, is also a target in the 'offensive' game . \u2018The British have a different humour from Americans. We sent a survey out on the internet with a list of the US cards and asked people to cross out the ones they didn\u2019t understand. Then I had meetings in pubs to discuss the cards we should include in the British version. \u2018Hillsborough seemed fair game because it was historic. When we were testing that card we never hit a raw nerve or got any complaints.\u2019 Cards Against Humanity was invented by eight childhood friends from Chicago in 2009. Fellow inventor Ben Hantoot said: \u2018We had no idea how it would take off. This was a game we made up on New Year\u2019s Eve to entertain ourselves.\u2019 The UK version also includes references to David Cameron and Ed Balls, J.\u2009K. Rowling, Boris Johnson and England\u2019s dislike of \u2018the bloody Welsh\u2019. Mr Hantoot said: \u2018We\u2019ve not had to withdraw any cards. \u201cJade Goody\u2019s cancerous remains\u201d is a cringer which came up during one of our play tests and remains one of the most popular cards. \u2018Madeleine McCann was the riskiest one because we don\u2019t have anything like that in the US version. That was the untested one but people love it. Our goal is to be as funny as possible and sometimes things that are really offensive are also really funny.\u2019 The eight inventors of the game are all now reportedly millionaires.",

        "article": "Angel Di Maria has been ruled out of Argentina\u2019s semi-final against Holland but fellow forward Sergio Aguero has recovered from a muscle strain and is fit to play, the team doctor said on Sunday. Aguero looked comfortable in training at the Argentine camp, but Di Maria was missing and undergoing intensive treatment after hobbling out of their 1-0 quarter-final win over Belgium. In their first semi-final since 1990, the South Americans play Holland in Sao Paulo on Wednesday. VIDEO Scroll down to hear Mascherano claim Holland are faster and stronger than Argentina . Doubt: Angel Di Maria's World Cup looks to be over after he suffered a thigh injury against Belgium . Replaced: Di Maria was substituted with a thigh injury in Argentina's win over Belgium . 'Angel has a grade one injury. Of course he won\u2019t play in Argentina\u2019s next game. After that, we\u2019ll evaluate the situation day-by-day,' team doctor Daniel Martinez told reporters. 'Sergio has practiced three times. He\u2019s ready to play.' Aguero missed two games due to a muscle strain but on the evidence of Sunday\u2019s afternoon training session at their camp in Belo Horizonte, the speedy forward should at least make the substitutes bench. Agony: Di Maria looks likely to miss Argentina's first World Cup semi-final since 1990 . Surprise boost: Argentina's team doctor revealed that Aguero had recovered and could play against Holland . The absence of Di Maria, the South Americans\u2019 most creative player after captain Lionel Messi, will be a big blow but the return to form of Gonzalo Higuain lessens the impact. Higuain\u2019s instinctive strike against Belgium gave Argentina passage to the semi-finals. Roared on by tens of thousands of fans who have crossed the border, Argentina are bidding for a third World Cup. To achieve it on the soil of rivals Brazil would be especially sweet. Relaxed: Lionel Messi and Ezequiel Lavezzi share a joke with Gonzalo Higuain (second from left) Forward thinking: Lavezzi is expected to start in attack with Messi and Higuain against Holland . What pressure? Messi lounges on his side during an Argentina training session in Vespasiano . The squad looked relaxed during training, laughing and joking with coach Alejandro Sabella. They are based at local team Atletico Mineiro\u2019s training complex, where motivational banners in blue-and-white colours give them encouragement as fans huddle at the gates outside. 'The group as a whole is very happy, except for the situation with Angel, which is a great shame,' said midfielder Javier Mascherano. 'We hope he recovers soon.' Happy camp: Sergio Aguero, who has recovered from a thigh injury, gestures during a training session . Under attack: Enzo Perez tries to escape from Gonzalo Higuain as Argentina's squad train in high spirits . Quiet moment: Maxi Rodriguez kisses Lavezzi affectionately on the neck while the rest of the squad laugh . Mascherano said Argentina\u2019s improved performance against Belgium was due to a more intelligent approach, which they had to repeat against the skilful Dutch. 'Against Belgium, we used the spaces better. We didn\u2019t rush. We waited for the right moment to pass,' he said. 'It was a lovely game but it was yesterday. Now we\u2019re focused on Holland. We know they are still smarting from defeat (in the final) in South Africa four years ago. 'We\u2019ve come far - Argentines have waited 24 years for this, but we want to go further.' VIDEO Argentina fans dream of Brazil final . Technique: Marcos Rojo prepares to strike the ball with his left foot during Argentina training . Laps: Sabella's squad enjoyed themselves during their training session on Sunday . VIDEO All Star XI: Lionel Messi .",

        "article": "(CNN) -- Age has slowed Sonic, the beloved blue hero from an earlier generation of video games, but Sega may have finally rehabilitated the venerable hedgehog. \"Sonic Generations,\" which arrives in stores Tuesday for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, comes at an opportune time. With a crucial holiday season imminent, Sega Sammy Holdings hasn't produced a stellar Sonic game in about a decade, and the company's game division has performed especially sluggishly this year. But \"Sonic Generations,\" coming on the 20th anniversary of the franchise, looks like a promising candidate to buck these trends. The first batch of reviews have been positive, and the game has received more preorders than any previous Sonic game, which is an early barometer for success. Sega also managed to build some buzz for the game at video game expos like E3, although those conventions have not been particularly kind to other Sonic games. Encouraged by the favorable feedback, Sega is throwing its marketing weight behind the game. These initiatives include traditional advertising, constructing a Sonic-themed playground in East Oakland, California, and a balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" debuted on Sega's Genesis game system in 1991. Since the heydays of Sega going head-to-head with Nintendo for home console domination, the company has ceased selling hardware, started developing\u00c2\u00a0for multiple systems and merged with Sammy, which makes pachinko slot machines in Japan. Perhaps as a result, Sega's flagship franchise, which is developed by the aptly named Sonic Team, has slumped. Sonic's and Mario's \"platformer\" genre -- in which cartoonish characters navigate increasingly challenging maze-like levels -- was once a blockbuster seller, but it's been surpassed by first-person shooters such as \"Call of Duty\" and \"Battlefield.\" Nintendo has managed to maintain the high quality of Mario games over the years, but Sega has struggled to remake Sonic for the fast-paced 21st-century game industry. \"Sonic Generations\" is designed to \"take Sonic back to the pure elements,\" Yasuhiro Noguchi, a senior producer who led development on the Western version of the game, said in an interview. Some previous games in the series became preoccupied with elaborate story lines and slower-paced exploration. American and European players may have been put off by elements of the plots that were geared toward audiences in Japan, where Sonic Team is based. \"The team tries very hard not to bias it for a particular territory,\" Noguchi said. \"They don't necessarily do stuff that is very, very specific to, say, their home territory. That's one of the learnings that has kind of informed their development DNA in the last 20 years -- that Sonic is loved internationally.\" For \"Sonic Generations\" and its predecessor, \"Sonic Colors\" for the Wii, Sega recruited writers from the television show \"Happy Tree Friends.\" They pen straightforward scripts that they hope will resonate with players outside of Asia, where Sonic's market is bigger. However, the writers must also adhere to standards set by Sega's Japan-based Sonic Committee, which is tasked with upholding the integrity of the Sonic brand. \"Sonic is a beloved franchise,\" Noguchi said. \"Disney has Mickey, and we have Sonic.\" \"Sonic Generations\" is looking to polish the franchise's legacy and reverse the recent decline of Sonic's popularity, said Patrick Riley, a U.S.-based development director for the company. \"I think that fans recognize that as far as the quality, Sonic is moving in the right direction.\" The game melds the classic two-dimensional action with three-dimensional exploration. \"We're truly bringing the 'A game' on 'Sonic Generations,' \" Noguchi said. \"In some ways, it is sort of a celebration and a sendoff for the first generation of Sonic.\" \"Sonic Generations\" will dip into past successes in its attempt to rebuild the franchise. Levels from classic Sonic games, such as the memorable Green Hill Zone, have been remade in 3-D. A dash of nostalgia may be just what Sega needs to reinvigorate its aging hedgehog.",

The temperature was five degrees with a windchill of -10 on Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. when the rescuers arrived, but they don't know how long the animal was left outside. Elsa's owners had cruelly wrapped her leash around her which had prevented her from being able to reach either food, water or shelter. 'The dog was incoherent, was not responsive. She didn't start crying until the water was poured on her,' said Trevino. Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived . Elsa suffered frost bite to her ears and feet, with her toes were frozen together so that they bleed when she tried to walk on them after she had been revived. According to Trevino, Elsa isn't out of the woods just yet and could lose a leg or two. FOX 2 reports that the veterinarian who had been working to save Elsa was too overwhelmed to speak on camera about what the dog had suffered. Healthy Paws are taking donations over the phone as they battle to save Else. 'It's going to pay her bill so she can be treated and stay here as long as she needs to stay until she recovers,' said Trevino. The dog's owners have been charged with cruelty and are due to appear in court.",

        "article": "Here's your guide to working out just how much you hate Manchester United: . If you think Wayne Rooney should have stayed on his feet and let a reckless 6ft 4in, 17-stone goalkeeper shatter his ankle with his wild two-footed lunge then you really do hate Manchester United. If you're re-writing the offside law claiming Ander Herrera's goal shouldn't have stood, you hate United. Wayne Rooney touched the ball past Preston goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup clash . Rooney went down a moment after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions . Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by the referee late on at Deepdale . Rooney scored from the spot to put Manchester United 3-1 up against Preston . Manchester City are shovelling money into Stevan Jovetic's bank account for nothing . If Arsenal  were as good as their fans would have us believe, the Gunners would be top and favourites for the Champions League . Tim Sherwood requires a superhuman effort to restore past glories to Aston Villa . West Ham are on the verge  but Big Sam's lack of empathy for fans holds them back . If you think Marouane Fellaini has fouled his marker before he slams home the second then you hate United. If you were desperate for Preston to hold on to their lead and felt immense disappointment bordering on physical pain when Herrera, Fellaini and then Rooney scored their goals then you hate Manchester United. If you are focusing on United not playing fluent football, and completely ignoring the fact that they have lost one game in 19, almost as if you're trying to convince yourself that run isn't true, then you hate United. If your focus is on Radamel Falcao not playing well then you're borderline obsessed with him, and you hate Manchester United. Ander Herrera has his shot while Rooney (left) stands in an offside position but does not touch the ball . Herrera runs away in celebration as the referee lets the goal stand while Preston remain unhappy . Herrera scored to make it 1-1 as United went on to win the FA Cup tie and avoid an upset . If you're desperately trying to manufacture more statistics and evidence that show just how much better United were under David Moyes than they are now under Louis van Gaal, then you've got too much time on your hands, and you hate Manchester United. If the success of your season is based on them going out of the FA Cup and dropping out of the top four rather than anything your own club might do, then you have an irrational hatred of United. If you've suddenly adopted a philosophy this season that winning a cup tie isn't as important as playing brilliant football during that tie, then you hate United. If you are focusing on United's negatives after Van Gaal's side made it through yet another away tie then you must be wondering how on earth your team is below United in the Premier League table. And you hate United. Marouane Fellaini smashes home his goal to make it 2-1 to United en route to their victory . Fellaini scores to give United the lead as they turn the game on its head at Deepdale . Fellaini celebrates as United progressed through the FA Cup tie to the quarter-finals despite an earlier scare . Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate as United take the lead in the FA Cup tie . If you keep saying United are terrible then you are trying to convince yourself they are terrible. Which is a bit weird. They're not great, but they're not terrible. This also means you hate United. If you've experienced untold voyeuristic joy since Sir Alex Ferguson left and United fell a third of the way down the table, then you hate Manchester United. If you are hammering home (to anyone who can't get away from you quick enough) a point about how much money United have spent, thinking that football is played on a computer screen and not on grass, then you hate United. When a club is as successful as Manchester United have been it's understandable that jealousy kicks in among supporters of lesser clubs, and that transforms itself into hatred. United manager Louis van Gaal pictured at Deepdale as his side beat Preston to make the quarter-finals . I don't know how United's season will finish, but my opinion is that if they end up outside the top four \u2013 even if they improve on last season's seventh place \u2013 then Van Gaal has failed. If they win the FA Cup it's a bonus, but United's season isn't about that. It's about getting back into the Champions League. United want to win the FA Cup of course, but the bigger clubs don't define true success around that competition. After the calamity of last season, Van Gaal was tasked with rebuilding. Helicoptering in a few expensive signings was only part of the rebuild for a club not used to dealing with failure on the scale they suffered last season. In simple terms, there is no fear factor with United anymore \u2013 that went last season with Moyes' side capitulating regularly. Look at Preston: they were woefully insipid in both legs of their Johnstone's Paint Trophy area final against Walsall recently, and missed the chance to get to Wembley. Van Gaal applauds at full-time after seeing off Preston as United continued their run in the FA Cup . United are in the FA Cup quarter-finals and are still on course to make the top four in the Premier League . But give them an FA Cup tie against Manchester United and all of a sudden they become a different side. And what about Cambridge United? They put so much effort into that 0-0 draw against Van Gaal's side they haven't won a game since. I get the tribalism of football, and I totally get that thousands and thousands of fans are absolutely desperate for United's misery to continue. But I also get that while Van Gaal's United are not going to be remembered as brilliant, he's got them back into the top four. Whether the Manchester United haters can accept it or not, if the Dutchman keeps United in the top four come the end of the season, he has hit the target most United fans would have set him at the start of the campaign. And if that happens, no amount of spin and nonsense about Rooney allegedly diving, United playing the long ball or Van Gaal being worse than Moyes will make the United-haters' summer any more bearable.",

        "article": "(CNN) -- At Camp 3 of Mount Everest at an altitude of 7,200 meters, an American woman, 50-year-old Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich, sits in a solitary tent. Outside, fierce winds of more than 50 knots are raging. She waits. Soon blizzard-bearing monsoon clouds will gather around Everest and bring an end to the climbing season on the high Himalayas. It will also draw a shroud over one of the single deadliest tragedies the world's highest mountain has ever witnessed. Before she can make begin her ascent, Weidlich must not only find a gap in the weather and a way over the avalanche, but also face down the growing controversies that erupted around continued activity on Everest in the wake of the disaster. More than 300 international climbers abandoned their goal of reaching the mountain's summit after an April 18 avalanche in the mountain's treacherous Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalese Sherpa mountaineers. The immediate aftermath of the disaster brought confusion and anger to the mountain as arguments raged over whether climbing should continue, the money paid to Sherpas and compensation for the sacrifices made. After avalanche, Nepal opens up unclimbed peaks . Domino effect . Some Sherpas called an unofficial moratorium on further climbs, with one group even reportedly sabotaging equipment. With safety in doubt, many international climbing companies decided to pull the plug, leading to a domino effect that also swept up the independent climbers who rely on shared resources. \"If 30% of your workforce walks away, it compromises your operational capabilities, given the difficulties of finding new porters, cooks, and guides in short time in the Khumbu,\" said one guide from a leading operator. Many were resigned to the sudden end to the season. \"I feel very sad about the Sherpas,\" said Ake Lindstrom, an adventure operator from Tanzania. \"Everybody knows each other; it is a small community and their loss is very tangible. It takes a small amount of empathy to let go of one's frustration.\" Weidlich, however, stayed. Later she was joined by Wang Jing, a 41-year-old Chinese woman also determined to press ahead with an attempt on the summit. Despite their determination in the face of calls for a halt to climbing, many Sherpas CNN Travel spoke to were not unhappy with their plans. Instead, they voiced other concerns, including the disparity they perceive between local and international guide salaries, overcrowding on the mountain, a lack of respect to their mountain god and those who died. There was also anger towards the Nepalese government over its response to the tragedy. Among the Everest climbing community questions were raised about the safety prior to the deaths. Some Sherpas said there had been too many on the mountain on the day of the disaster, with long lines forming as people traversed the ladders over crevasses. Mourning in an Everest Sherpa village . 'One mistake and you are done' \"It was so packed that for some, there was no place to hide when the ice started to fall,\" one said. \"We never saw so many people on the icefall on one day.\" One expert expressed strong concerns about renewed climbing. \"The mountains are in constant movement, which is what makes the icefall dangerous,\" said Gian Piero Verza, of the Pyramid high-altitude research center, located at 5,050 meters on Everest. \"You have to consider that in two months of expeditions, some Sherpas spend an average of three hours daily on the icefall to carry their load. For some that is 200 hours in a very dangerous place.\" Veteran expedition leader Jamie McGuinness, however, said he was surprised that more did not defy the exodus to take advantage of conditions similar to those when Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first summited in 1953. \"Hard-core mountaineers would jump at the chance to have Everest and Lhotse all for themselves during the best climbing season,\" he says. \"But being there without backup is like being back in epic Hillary's time: one mistake and you are done.\" Back at Camp 3, in her gale-battered tent, Weidlich is convinced she is doing the right thing by continuing with her plan to summit Lhotse, a peak connected to Everest's South Col. She says she knows the family of one of the victims and when she visited them after the disaster was not met with hostility and was invited to stay for the funeral. \"I asked them if they felt it would be disrespectful if I continued with my climbing plan,\" she says. \"They were concerned about my safety, but they never brought up the issue of respect.\" Weidlich, who is on a personal mission to climb all 14 of the world's mountains over 8,000 meters, says the problem lies with assisted climbing. \"High mountains are dangerous, and climbing is all about the experience. You have to evaluate the risks. But Everest has become a completely different place: it is a showtime place. People come here to make silly records. American climber recounts how Sherpa saved his life . Climbing in isolation . \"This is not real mountaineering. To me, if you cannot free climb a mountain and you need someone else to help you up or down, you don't belong on it.\" Weidlich hits out at claims that Sherpas had forced people to abandon the mountain saying they had treated her well. She also speaks of the excitement of climbing in isolation. \"I am very much looking forward to experiencing the mountain for what it is, without the crowds. It will be rewarding to be in contact with nature -- to hear the cracking of the ice and not the generators.\" When at last the gales ease, it is finally time for Weidlich to face the mountain, but she is ultimately unable to reach her goal. Because of the dangers on the Icefall, both Weidlich and Wang bypass it using helicopters -- a highly controversial move that could invalidate any claim to a successful climb. Wang reaches the summit of Everest on May 23 along with five Sherpas. Weidlich, however, decides to abandon her attempt on Lhotse because \"that would be like claiming a whole mountain when I would only have climbed half of it.\" Shortly afterward, the monsoon closes in for good, leaving Everest to brood alone over another season of triumphs for some and tragedies for others. Andrea Oschetti is a Hong Kong-based freelance travel writer currently traveling through Bhutan and Nepal.",

        "article": "Amelie Mauresmo believes that Andy Murray can round off their first five months working together by regaining his place in the much-vaunted Big Four by the end of next week. The 27-year-old Scot can make the jump from his current position of number six if he enjoys success at the Barclays ATP World Finals that begins on Sunday, and Mauresmo he is in the form to do it. 'He could aim for the win there. I think for him the important thing is going to be to try to finish the year at No 4. There is a possibility of that,' she said as Murray stepped his preparations at London's Queen's Club. Andy Murray returns the ball to Novak Djokovic during the ATP World Tour Masters quarter-finals in Paris . Stan Wawrinka is 420 points ahead of Murray at four while Kei Nishikori is 150 points above. The long and short is that the British player may have to win at least two matches although one might do, depending on how the Swiss and the Japanese fare. 'Andy has won many matches, beating top 10 players again, which he hadn't been doing for a while, though he did beat Jo (Wifried Tsonga) at the US Open,' she said. 'That was important. That was another step I wanted him to feel. The other step was to win tournaments. I wanted him to feel what it was like to finish the week without losing. 'Obviously he's a little bit tired, but he's also in great confidence. Maybe it balances that tiredness a little bit. But we're looking forward to the end of the tournament here and London, to maybe start 2015 in a better position.' Amelie Mauresmo has backed Murray to make a return to the top four sooner rather than later . Mauresmo is also anticipating the window they will have together in the off-season, and it sounds like developing his undoubted volleying skills and using them more regularly at the net will be on the agenda. 'I think he has the ability to do it probably a little more often than he does. It's not an easy process. I think it's also not a fast one. I think we're both looking towards that. 'You can't do everything at once. He needed some confidence back. He needed many things before getting to this part of the work. Really other priorities were there before this specific area of his game.' 'When you're like Andy and you can do many different things, you have to choose the right shot at the right time. And that's not easy to do. He's trying to have perfect shot selection but it's not easy.' Murray's appointment of a female as coach, first revealed by Sportsmail, has been one of the season's main talking points and the former women's number one is delighted how they have gelled on a personal basis. Murray came up short against Djokovic but will be hoping to go all the way in London next week . 'We're getting on well together. Personally I wouldn't be able to work with a man or a woman player without having a good connection, a good feel for each other. It doesn't happen immediately. I'm not the type of person who opens up that easily, he also. It took a bit of time, but the relationship is good. It's something that is good for both of us, I would say.' She admits that a reluctance to travel was almost a stumbling block to their arrangement, but she is ready to commit to half the year on the road with him. 'The down part for me, as I see it, is definitely the travelling, but I accept it and I'm ready to do it, as long as he wants me to and as long as I also want to do it.' It has also helped that gets on well with his other coach Dani Vallverdu plus the physios and coaches that make up the team. The big test for her relationship with Murray is likely to come next year, but she feels he is in good shape to train on after his recent tear through Asia and Europe that qualified him for London. The Scot will be looking to be back and among the most elite players ranked in the world, like Roger Federer . 'It would be hard not to be pleased with that,' she said. ' After New York he was not in a great position to enter the Tour Finals. It was decided that he was going to go for it, have a few weeks in a row, we were not sure exactly how many and a lot would depend on the results he had in Asia. 'Then it was pretty clear he had to do the six weeks in a row, he did great and all the credit to him fighting like crazy and physically holding up well. 'His body and his back, there was a question mark there, all the work that has been done as recovery part of the plan was great. He should be proud of the last part of the season, he has been winning a lot of matches it gives him quite a lot of confidence.'",

        "article": "The witness was suggested to be a \"compulsive liar\" and a \"wicked woman\" by defence barrister Tayyab Khan. (Picture posed by model) A judge was forced to intervene after a barrister tried to force an alleged victim of child-sex grooming to read out graphic details of her alleged abuse. The witness, suggested to be a 'compulsive liar' and a 'wicked woman' by defence barrister Tayyab Khan, is one of seven alleged victims in a sex exploitation trial at Stafford Crown Court. But the 19-year-old, who cannot be named, left the stand in tears as she was asked to read out her account of an alleged sexual assault on her by her step-father - unrelated to the sex exploitation trial - that she made to police in 2005. The teenager was . asked why she had retracted her claim her step-father raped her when she was 13. She . said when she told her mother, the allegation was reported to police, . but she retracted it a day later to protect her 'because I didn't want . my mum to be upset', the jury was told. The alleged victim, the third of the seven alleged victims to give . evidence at the three month trial, insisted it was not a false . allegation, according to The Times. Mr Khan suggested she had invented the story and asked her to read out details of the abuse she claimed to have suffered. Crying, she read out a section of her account, and broke down a second time. On the stand: The witness is one of seven alleged victims in a sex exploitation trial at Stafford Crown Court pictured . After some members of the jury shook their heads at her distress, judge Robin Onions stepped in and said: 'It's extremely painful for the witness, Mr Khan. Why can't . you read it to her?' Later, Mr Khan said: 'You are a compulsive liar. You have told lies about my client, also?' The lawyer said she had told lies about his client, 23-year-old Ahdel Ali, who with his brother Mubarek Ali, 28, is accused of arranging her prostitution in 2008 and 2009. Seven men from Telford have denied more than 50 charges relating to sexual exploitation and child prostitution. The teenager claims Ali took her to have sex with two workers at a Wellington restaurant. According to the BBC, the witness said: 'Were you there? You don't know anything. He did take me to the restaurant.' She began to cry and swore at Mr Khan when she was asked about a separate incident in 2009 involving a middle-aged Asian man. After returning to the stand, the teenager said she had punched the man when he 'tried to put his hand up my mate's top.' Mr Khan said the man had been supplying the girls with alcohol but the witness had threatened to make a rape claim against him when he refused to give them any more. Mr Khan then branded the witness a 'very wicked woman' and suggested she had invented malicious allegations. She denied that she had made any false allegations. The other five defendants in the trial are Noshad Hussain, 21, Mohammed Ali Sultan, 24; Tanveer Ahmed, 39; Mahroof Khan, 33; and Mohammed Islam Choudhrey, 52. The men live in the Wellington and Sutton Hill areas of Telford and deny charges related to incidents alleged to have happened between 2007 and 2009. The trial continues.

A terrified teenage couple were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels. Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and her boyfriend Ged Sykes, 18, were checking out of their five-star hotel in Krakow, Poland, when staff demanded \u00a341 to pay for the towels, which were lightly marked with mud. The young couple, who were on holiday earlier this month for Ged\u2019s 18th birthday, said the situation escalated when they had no money to pay for them and staff called two 'burly' armed police officers who demanded their passports. Scroll down for video . Francesca Stefanyszyn, 17, and Ged Sykes, 18, were confronted by armed police on their first holiday abroad - over a row about dirty hand towels . Francesca, an A-level student, said: 'I was absolutely petrified. Our flight was two hours away and I thought I was going to be arrested or shot. 'We had used the towels to lie on when we visited a park and they were very lightly marked with soil. 'We had handed them in four days before we were leaving so the hotel could clean them but staff waited until we were getting picked up to be taken to the airport before they raised an issue. 'They told us they were stained but you could see they hadn\u2019t even tried to wash them. 'We had no money left and couldn\u2019t pay so they called the police. The teenage couple had used the towels to lie on during a visit to a park while on their holiday in Krakow . 'Two big officers arrived straight away carrying guns and blocked the exit so we were trapped in the hotel. 'They didn\u2019t speak any English so we couldn\u2019t explain our side of things and they just kept demanding our passports. 'They took them from us and then our taxi to the airport couldn\u2019t wait for us anymore and drove off. The couple were terrified when hotel staff called the police and demanded they hand over their passports. Miss Stefanyszyn feared they would miss their flight home and be arrested . 'I was crying my eyes out. I thought we were going to be arrested or stranded in Poland. 'I\u2019d never been on holiday without my parents before and I just didn\u2019t know what to do.' Francesca phoned her father Taras, 49, who paid the 200 Zloty over the phone with his credit card. Mr Stefanyszyn had booked the trip for the pair, paying for flights, a five-night stay at the Crown Piast Hotel and transfers, as a present for Ged\u2019s birthday. He said: 'It was early in the morning and I got a very distressed phone call from Fran. 'She had never been away on her own before and she was in tears. 'She felt very threatened by the two burly police officers who had turned up armed with guns and truncheons. 'I asked to speak to the manager but they were really aggressive with me on the phone and said he wasn\u2019t around. 'If I hadn\u2019t been able to pay over the phone they would probably have been arrested. 'There were no niceties and they were bang out of order. 'Fran and Ged brought the towels home with them for us to see and they weren\u2019t even stained. 'They just had a few marks on them so I couldn\u2019t believe how they had reacted. The couple were staying in the five star Crown Piast Hotel in Krakow, as part of a birthday gift to Mr Sykes from his girlfriend's father, Taras Stefanyszyn . 'They hadn\u2019t even attempted to clean them. 'I think they saw two kids and thought they could get more money from them. 'It\u2019s such a shame because I suggested Krakow when they were deciding where to go. I love the place and thought it would be a really safe place for them to go.' The couple only just managed to catch their flight home thanks to the intervention of Francesca\u2019s father and washed the towels when they arrived home. It was the couple's first holiday alone together to celebrate Mr Sykes's 18th birthday . Francesca, who is of Ukrainian and Russian descent, said: 'All of the marks came out with just one wash. 'The whole thing was a horrible experience and it means I will be really cautious when I next go on holiday. 'I didn\u2019t know how to deal with what happened and now I\u2019m wary at the thought of travelling anywhere.

The five men and one woman were released on bail after being questioned by officials from the National Crime Agency. They are allegedly \u2018significant\u2019 players in the notorious secret website known as Silk Road 2.0, which is at the centre of the \u2018dark web\u2019 trade in illicit drugs, forged documents, criminal devices and even firearms. The British gang were arrested over their alleged involvement in Silk Road, the world's biggest online marketplace for drugs . It was targeted by a joint European and US operation across 17 countries which culminated in the closure of over 400 other websites and services. US agencies also announced the detention of the website\u2019s alleged boss Blake Benthall, a 26-year-old from San Francisco, this week. The British arrests included a 20-year-old man from Liverpool, a 19-year-old man from New Waltham in Lincolnshire and a 30-year-old man from Cleethorpes. In Aberdovey, on the west coast of Wales, a 29-year-old man and a man and woman, both aged 58, were also held. The international operation involved dozens of cybercrime specialists who spent six months mapping the structure of the illegal sites. Raids around the world on those responsible for running them led to the seizure of drugs, guns, cash and $1million of virtual currency Bitcoin. The alleged homepage of Silk Road 2.0 website, which was taken down in a blaze of publicity by the FBI last year . Roy McComb, of the NCA, said further arrests are likely. He said the agency is \u2018determined\u2019 to prosecute people committing crime on the dark web, adding: \u2018This is just like any other organised crime network.\u2019 The original Silk Road website was taken down in blaze of publicity by the FBI in September 2013. Since the second version began trading a year ago, it is thought to have allowed more than 100,000 people to buy and sell contraband. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Firefighters, air tankers and helicopters replaced hikers and campers in the recreation-rich San Gabriel Canyon on Monday after a wildfire forced authorities to close the area for Labor Day. Authorities evacuated the canyon Sunday after the fire broke out in Angeles National Forest, an urban recreation area near Los Angeles that is popular with hikers, campers and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. About 50 residents and 1,000 campers were evacuated, CNN affiliate KABC reported. \"I know we have some neighbors up there that didn't leave. We're really worried about them,\" evacuee Toni Kova told KABC. Kova and her husband live in Camp Williams, which was evacuated Sunday. \"We saw the smoke and the fire coming over the hill. The river is literally our front yard and the mountains that the fires were coming over,\" she said. \"We were like, we gotta start packing up.\" Officials told KABC the fight was made more difficult by the steep and rugged terrain. The U.S. Forest Service in California said on its Twitter feed it expected a \"very active\" fire because of low humidity and high temperatures. Between 10,000 and 12,000 people use the area during an average holiday weekend, according to Inciweb, the government fire-tracking website. Structures in Camp Williams, a camping and recreational vehicle resort, are in danger from the fire even though it is burning to the northeast toward a wilderness area, Inciweb said. About 400 firefighters, a heavy air tanker and six helicopters are working on the blaze, which had burned through about 4,000 acres of brush by Monday afternoon, according to Inciweb. The brush, comprised mostly of chaparral, is very thick in some areas. The fire is 5% contained, the website said. Inciweb said the cause of the fire was under investigation. CNN affiliate KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, citing a U.S. Forest Service official, reported the fire began when a car caught fire. The Red Cross has opened an evacuation center in Glendora, California.",
